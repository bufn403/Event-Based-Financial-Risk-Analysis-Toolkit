Part I Item 1A, 1B, and 1C 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Corporate Governance 
The Board of Directors is responsible for oversight of the identification, management, and mitigation of enterprise-wide risk, including cybersecurity risk. The Audit Committee has the primary responsibility for overseeing risk management, including oversight of cybersecurity risk management practices and performance. The Audit Committee generally receives reports at each regular quarterly meeting provided by the Chief Information Officer, the CSO, the CISO, and the General Auditor on the cybersecurity management program. The reports focus on the programs and protocols in place to mitigate cybersecurity risks, led by the CSO. Among other things, the reports may include: recent cyber risk and cybersecurity developments; industry engagement activities; legislative and regulatory developments; cyber-risk governance and oversight; selected cyber risk metrics and activities; cyber risk incident response plans and strategies; cybersecurity drills and exercises; assessments by third party experts and Internal Audit; and major projects and initiatives. 
While the Board of Directors and Audit Committee oversee cybersecurity risk management, Entergy&#8217;s management is responsible for managing cybersecurity risk. Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; security-risk-management system, as discussed above, is comprised of a three lines of defense model to enhance risk management efforts and define roles in the security program. The first line of defense, comprised of business units performing operational functions, including the CISO, is responsible for identification and management of security and reliability risks directly through design, implementation, and execution of control activities. The second line of defense, comprised of the CSO and Chief Security Office, performs and supports security and reliability risk management and governs and oversees the execution of security and reliability controls by the first line of defense. Ownership of specific security operations may migrate from a business unit in the first line of defense to the second line of defense, as determined to be appropriate by the Chief Security Office. The third line of defense, which includes Internal Audit, independent third parties, and certain regulatory constructs, such as the NERC Reliability Standards and the NRC Cyber Rule, provides assurance of selective actions taken by the first and second lines of defense to senior management and the Board of Directors. 
Entergy&#8217;s CSO is responsible for overseeing physical, cyber, and reliability risk, including governance, compliance, and threat intelligence. The CSO&#8217;s background includes serving as the Global Lead Business Information Security Officer for a multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology company, Vice President of Cybersecurity Solutions for an international consulting firm, and an operations manager for a multinational technology company. The CSO is also a former intelligence officer in the U.S. Marine Corps, with experience in the Fleet Marine Force, Joint Staff J-2/Defense Intelligence Agency, and Headquarters Marine Corps Command, Control, Communications, and Computers (C4I). The CSO participated in numerous exercises and crisis operations during his time in the military. The CSO is a certified Information Security Manager from the Information Systems Audit and Control Association and a certified Information Privacy Manager from the International Association of Privacy Professionals. The CSO also completed the Harvard Kennedy School Executive Education Program in Cybersecurity and the FBI Domestic Security Executive Academy. 
Entergy&#8217;s CISO is responsible for enterprise strategic and operational cybersecurity, physical security systems, and regulatory compliance. The CISO oversees investments in tools, resources, and processes that allow for the continuous improvement and maturity of Entergy&#8217;s cybersecurity posture. The CISO has expertise spanning more than 25 years in the realm of information technology, information security, and cyber/physical security management. The CISO&#8217;s background includes serving as the Vice President and Chief Information Security Officer for an electric utility with responsibility for enterprise cybersecurity covering corporate, electric, nuclear, and gas operations. Additionally, the CISO served as the Chief Security Officer for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas with overall responsibility for its cybersecurity, physical security, and emergency management programs. Her previous experience includes multiple technical, managerial, and strategic roles within industries ranging from energy, telecommunication, software development, and cybersecurity consulting. The CISO is a Certified Information Systems Security Professional, Certified Information Security Manager, and Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control. 
Part I Item 1A, 1B, and 1C 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
In the event of a suspected or actual cybersecurity incident, the Security Incident Response Team (SIRT), which includes the CISO, has primary responsibility for initial identification and evaluation of potential business impacts and escalation of the incident&#8217;s severity classification using pre-established criteria with a specified communication matrix and escalation thresholds. The Security Incident Commander, which role is served by rotating leaders in the CISO organization, provides tactical leadership and oversight management at the cross-functional level for the incident. The SIRT remains engaged throughout the incident response lifecycle, including detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery, and post-incident remediation, and coordinates with the impacted business functions, if warranted. Once a cyber incident is confirmed, the SIRT is responsible for maintaining situational awareness and continuous monitoring of the need for escalation or de-escalation of the incident&#8217;s severity classification. As certain escalation thresholds are exceeded, additional levels of management notification are required by the SIRT, including notification of and recurring communication with Entergy&#8217;s Incident Response Team, which includes the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, the CSO, other executive management, and members of the affected business functions. Depending upon the facts, analysis, materiality, and anticipated or current impacts, the Chief Executive Officer and the General Counsel will determine the timing and cadence for communication of the cyber incident with the Board of Directors or Audit Committee.

See &#8220; RISK FACTORS SUMMARY &#8221; in Part I Item 1 for a summary of Entergy&#8217;s and the Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; risk factors. 
Investors should review carefully the following risk factors and the other information in this Form 10-K. The risks that Entergy faces are not limited to those in this section. There may be additional risks and uncertainties (either currently unknown or not currently believed to be material) that could adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. See &#8220; FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION .&#8221; 
Utility Regulatory Risks 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) 
The terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the Utility operating companies and System Energy are determined through regulatory approval proceedings that can be lengthy and subject to appeal, potentially resulting in delays in effecting rate changes, lengthy litigation, the risk of disallowance of recovery of certain costs, and uncertainty as to ultimate results. 
The Utility operating companies are regulated on a cost-of-service and rate of return basis and are subject to statutes and regulatory commission rules and procedures. The rates that the Utility operating companies and System Energy charge reflect their capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, allowed rates of return, financing costs, and related costs of service. These rates significantly influence the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and each of the Utility operating companies and System Energy. These rates are determined in regulatory proceedings and are subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment, including adjustment upon the initiative of a regulator or, in some cases, affected stakeholders. Regulators in a future rate proceeding may alter the timing or amount of certain costs for which recovery is allowed or modify the current authorized rate of return. Rate refunds may also be required, subject to applicable law. 
In addition, regulators have initiated and may initiate additional proceedings to investigate the prudence of costs in the Utility operating companies&#8217; and System Energy&#8217;s base rates and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of the companies&#8217; operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures (including storm costs and costs associated with capital projects), allowed rates of return and rate base, proposed resource acquisitions, and previously incurred capital expenditures that the operating companies seek to place in rates. The regulators may disallow costs subject to their jurisdiction found not to have been prudently incurred or found not to have been incurred in compliance with applicable tariffs, creating some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or reduce rates. Traditional base rate proceedings, as opposed to formula rate plans, generally have long timelines, are primarily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited in scope or duration by statute. The length of these base rate proceedings can cause the Utility operating companies and System Energy to experience regulatory lag in recovering costs through rates, such that the Utility operating companies may not fully recover all costs during the rate effective period and may, therefore, earn less than their allowed returns. Decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings. For a discussion of such appeals and related litigation for both the Utility operating companies and System Energy, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 
The Utility operating companies have large customer and stakeholder bases and, as a result, could be the subject of public criticism or adverse publicity focused on issues including the operation and maintenance of their assets and infrastructure, their preparedness for major storms or other extreme weather events and/or the time it takes to restore service after such events, or the quality of their service or the reasonableness of the cost of their 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
service. Criticism or adverse publicity of this nature could render legislatures and other governing bodies, public service commissions and other regulatory authorities, and government officials less likely to view the applicable operating company in a favorable light and could potentially negatively affect legislative or regulatory processes or outcomes, as well as lead to increased regulatory oversight or more stringent legislative or regulatory requirements or other legislation or regulatory actions that adversely affect the Utility operating companies. 
The Utility operating companies and System Energy, and the energy industry as a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments and an upward trend in spending, especially with respect to infrastructure investments, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future and could result in more frequent rate cases and requests for, and the continuation of, cost recovery mechanisms, all of which could face resistance from customers and other stakeholders especially in a rising cost environment, whether due to inflation or high fuel prices or otherwise, and/or in periods of economic decline or hardship. Significant increases in costs could increase financing needs and otherwise adversely affect Entergy, the Utility operating companies, and System Energy&#8217;s business, financial position, results of operation, or cash flows. For information regarding rate case proceedings and formula rate plans applicable to the Utility operating companies, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 
Changes to state or federal legislation or regulation affecting electric generation, electric and natural gas transmission, distribution, and related activities could adversely affect Entergy and the Utility operating companies&#8217; financial position, results of operations, or cash flows and their utility businesses. 
If legislative and regulatory structures evolve in a manner that erodes the Utility operating companies&#8217; exclusive rights to serve their regulated customers, they could lose customers and sales and their results of operations, financial position, or cash flows could be materially affected. Additionally, technological advances in energy efficiency and distributed energy resources are reducing the costs of these technologies and, together with ongoing state and federal subsidies, the increasing penetration of these technologies could result in reduced sales by the Utility operating companies. Such loss of sales, due to the methodology used to determine cost of service rates or otherwise, could put upward pressure on rates, possibly resulting in adverse regulatory actions to mitigate such effects on rates. Further, the failure of regulatory structures to evolve to accommodate the changing needs and desires of customers with respect to the sourcing and use of electricity also could diminish sales by the operating companies. Entergy and the Utility operating companies cannot predict if or when they may be subject to changes in legislation or regulation, or the extent and timing of reductions of the cost of distributed energy resources, nor can they predict the impact of these changes on their results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 
The Utility operating companies recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or disallowance in regulatory proceedings, and sudden or prolonged increases in fuel and purchased power costs could lead to increased customer arrearages or bad debt expenses. 
The Utility operating companies recover their fuel, purchased power, and associated costs from their customers through rate mechanisms subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. Because regulatory review can result in the disallowance of incurred costs found not to have been prudently incurred or not reflected in rates as permitted by approved rate schedules and accounting rules, including the cost of replacement power purchased when generators experience outages or when planned outages are extended, with the possibility of refunds to ratepayers, there exists some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs, particularly when there are substantial or sudden increases in such costs. Regulators also may initiate proceedings to investigate the continued usage or the adequacy and operation of the fuel and purchased power recovery clauses of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, there can be no assurance that existing recovery mechanisms will remain unchanged or in effect at all. 
The Utility operating companies&#8217; cash flows can be negatively affected by the time delays between when gas, power, or other commodities are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers of the costs in rates. On occasion, when the level of incurred costs for fuel and purchased power rises very dramatically, some 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
of the Utility operating companies may agree to defer recovery of a portion of that period&#8217;s fuel and purchased power costs for recovery at a later date, which could increase the near-term working capital and borrowing requirements of those companies. The Utility operating companies also may experience, and in some instances have experienced, an increase in customer bill arrearages and bad debt expenses due to, among other reasons, increases in fuel and purchased power costs, especially in periods of economic decline or hardship. For a description of fuel and purchased power recovery mechanisms and information regarding the regulatory proceedings for fuel and purchased power cost recovery, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 
The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the MISO markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs. The operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system pursuant to the MISO RTO tariff and their participation in the MISO RTO&#8217;s wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 
On December 19, 2013, the Utility operating companies integrated into the MISO RTO. MISO maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and administers wholesale energy and ancillary services markets for market participants in the MISO region, including the Utility operating companies. The Utility operating companies sell capacity, energy, and ancillary services on a bilateral basis to certain wholesale customers and offer available electricity production of their owned and controlled generating facilities into the MISO resource adequacy construct (the annual Planning Resource Auction, discussed below), as well as the day-ahead and real-time energy markets pursuant to the MISO tariff and market rules. The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the MISO markets and resource adequacy construct. MISO tariff rules and system conditions, including transmission congestion, could affect the Utility operating companies&#8217; ability to sell capacity, energy, and/or ancillary services in certain regions and/or the economic value of such sales, or the cost of serving the Utility operating companies&#8217; respective loads. MISO market rules may change or be interpreted in ways that cause additional cost and risk, including compliance risk. 
The Utility operating companies participate in the MISO regional transmission planning process and are subject to risks associated with planning decisions that MISO makes in the exercise of control over the planning of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission assets that are under MISO&#8217;s functional control. The Utility operating companies pay transmission rates that reflect the cost of transmission projects that the Utility operating companies do not own, which could increase cash or financing needs. Further, FERC policies and regulation addressing cost responsibility for transmission projects, including transmission projects to interconnect new generation facilities, may potentially give rise to cash and financing-related risks as well as result in upward pressure on the retail rates of the Utility operating companies, which, in turn, may result in adverse actions by the Utility operating companies&#8217; retail regulators. In addition to the cash and financing-related risks arising from the potential additional cost allocation to the Utility operating companies from transmission projects of others or changes in FERC policies or regulation related to cost responsibility for transmission projects, there is a risk that the Utility operating companies&#8217; business and financial position could be harmed as a result of lost investment opportunities and other effects that flow from an increased number of competitive projects being approved and constructed that are interconnected with their transmission systems. 
Further, the terms and conditions of the MISO tariff, including provisions related to the design and implementation of wholesale markets, the allocation of transmission upgrade costs, the MISO-wide allowed base rate of return on equity, and any required MISO-related charges and credits are subject to regulation by the FERC. The operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system pursuant to the MISO tariff and their participation in the MISO wholesale markets, and the resulting costs, may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 
Moreover, the resource adequacy construct provided under the MISO tariff confers certain rights and imposes certain obligations upon load-serving entities, including the Utility operating companies, that are served 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
from the transmission systems subject to MISO&#8217;s functional control, including the transmission facilities of the Utility operating companies. The MISO tariff provisions governing these rights and obligations are subject to change and have recently undergone significant changes, some of which are the subject of pending litigation and/or appeals. Due to their magnitude and the speed with which they have been implemented, these changes carry risk, including compliance risk, and may result in material additional costs being passed through to the Utility operating companies&#8217; customers in retail rates, including but not limited to additional capacity costs incurred in the annual MISO Planning Resource Auction. Also, by virtue of the Utility operating companies&#8217; participation in MISO and the design and terms of the MISO resource adequacy construct, other load-serving entities served by the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission assets, which are under MISO&#8217;s functional control, may be able to circumvent reasonable resource planning obligations and avoid, in whole or in part, the full cost of procuring the resources reasonably needed to reliably supply their respective loads. In particular, the design of the current MISO resource adequacy construct and the absence of a minimum capacity obligation in MISO create a risk of other load-serving entities engaging in &#8220;free ridership&#8221; through their strategy for participation in the MISO resource adequacy construct and energy and ancillary services markets &#8211; specifically, by using energy and ancillary services available from the Utility operating companies&#8217; owned and controlled generating units without paying a reasonable share of the cost of the capacity required to provide such energy and ancillary services. As a result, there are a variety of risks to the Utility operating companies and their customers, including the risk of bearing additional costs for resources needed to ensure reliable service, the risk of reduced reliability and the enhanced risk of outages and lost sales which, because of the methodology for establishing cost of service rates, presents the risk of upward pressure on the Utility operating companies&#8217; rates. 
In addition, orders from each of the Utility operating companies&#8217; respective retail regulators generally require that the Utility operating companies make periodic filings, or generally allow the retail regulator to direct the making of such filings, setting forth the results of analysis of the costs and benefits realized from MISO membership as well as the projected costs and benefits of continued membership in MISO and/or requesting approval of their continued membership in MISO. These filings have been submitted periodically by each of the Utility operating companies as required by their respective retail regulators, and the outcome of the resulting proceedings may affect the Utility operating companies&#8217; continued membership in MISO. 
The continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and responsive measures taken on Entergy&#8217;s and its Utility operating companies&#8217; business, results of operations, and financial condition are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. 
The global 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic continues to be an evolving situation and could lead to further disruption of the general economy, impacts on the customers of Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies, and disruption of the operations of Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries, whether due to, among other things, the emergence or spread of new variants of COVID-19, precautionary or reactionary measures, market reactions or impacts, or supply chain constraints. 
Entergy and its Utility operating companies experienced an increase in arrearages and bad debt expense due to non-payment by customers. The arrearages due to COVID-19 have begun to decline, although management cannot predict the timing of the completion of collections of such arrearages. While the Utility operating companies are working with regulators to ensure ultimate recovery for those and other COVID-19 related costs, the amount, method, and timing of such recovery is subject to approval by the retail regulators. 
Entergy and its Registrant Subsidiaries also could experience, and in some cases have experienced, among other challenges that originated during or have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic: supply chain, vendor, and contractor disruptions, including shortages or delays in the availability of key components, parts, and supplies such as electronic components and solar panels; delays in completion of capital or other construction projects, maintenance, and other operations activities, including prolonged or delayed refueling and maintenance outages; delays in regulatory proceedings; workforce availability challenges, including from COVID-19 infections, health, or safety issues; increased storm recovery costs; increased cybersecurity risks as a result of many employees 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
telecommuting; volatility in the credit or capital markets (and any related increased cost of capital or any inability to access the capital markets or draw on available credit facilities); or other adverse impacts on their ability to execute on business strategies and initiatives. 
Although the economy has been recovering, another economic decline could adversely impact Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; liquidity and cash flows, including through declining sales, reduced revenues, delays in receipts of customer payments, or increased bad debt expense. The Utility operating companies also may experience regulatory outcomes that require them to postpone planned investment and otherwise reduce costs due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their customers, especially in an environment of higher inflation. In addition, if the COVID-19 pandemic or related impacts create additional disruptions or turmoil in the credit or financial markets, or adversely impact Entergy&#8217;s credit metrics or ratings, such developments could adversely affect its ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet its liquidity needs or cause a decrease in the value of its defined benefit pension trust funds, as well as its nuclear decommissioning trust funds, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. 
Entergy cannot predict the extent or duration of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of new or existing variants of COVID-19, the effectiveness of mitigation efforts, further governmental responsive measures, or the extent of the effects or ultimate impacts on the global, national or local economy, the capital markets, or its customers, suppliers, operations, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 
A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred as a result of severe weather, the impact on customer bills of permitted storm cost recovery, or the inability to securitize future storm restoration costs could have material effects on Entergy and its Utility operating companies. 
Entergy&#8217;s and its Utility operating companies&#8217; results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition can be materially affected by the destructive effects of severe weather. Severe weather can also result in significant outages for the customers of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, reduced revenues for the Utility operating companies during the period of the outages. A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred, inability to securitize future storm restoration costs, or loss of revenues as a result of severe weather could have a material effect on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather, including lower credit ratings and, thus, higher costs for future debt issuances. The inability to recover losses either excluded by insurance or in excess of the insurance limits that can be secured economically also could have a material effect on Entergy and its Utility operating companies. In addition, the recovery of major storm restoration costs from customers could effectively limit our ability to make planned capital or other investments due to the impact of such storm cost recovery on customer bills, especially in a rising cost environment. 
In August 2021, Hurricane Ida caused extensive damage to the Entergy distribution and, to a lesser extent, transmission systems across Louisiana, resulting in storm costs of $2.5 billion. Entergy Louisiana began recovering a portion of these costs through securitization financings in 2022. In January 2023 the LPSC issued orders finding prudent the costs incurred by Entergy Louisiana in responding to Hurricane Ida and allowing Entergy Louisiana to securitize the remaining $1.491 billion in such costs. Because such orders are not yet final and non-appealable (due to the forty-five day appeal period) and, further, because the bond rating and marketing process has yet to occur, there is an element of risk, and Entergy Louisiana is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate success of its recovery initiatives or the timing of such recovery. 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Weather, economic conditions, technological developments, and other factors may have a material impact on electricity and gas sales and otherwise materially affect the Utility operating companies &#8217; results of operations and system reliability. 
Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase electric cooling demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels in the winter tend to increase electric and gas heating demand and revenues. As a corollary, mild temperatures in either season tend to decrease energy usage and resulting revenues. Higher consumption levels coupled with seasonal pricing differentials typically cause the Utility operating companies to report higher revenues in the third quarter of the fiscal year than in the other quarters. Changing weather patterns and extreme weather conditions, including hurricanes or tropical storms, flooding events, or ice storms, the frequency or intensity of which may be exacerbated by climate change, may stress the Utility operating companies&#8217; generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on their ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, criticism or adverse publicity, and reduced customer satisfaction. These extreme conditions could have a material effect on the Utility operating companies&#8217; financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
Entergy&#8217;s electricity sales volumes are affected by a number of factors including weather and economic conditions, trends in energy efficiency, new technologies, and self-generation alternatives, including the willingness and ability of large industrial customers to develop co-generation facilities that greatly reduce their grid demand. In addition, changes to regulatory policies, such as those that allow customers to directly access the market to procure wholesale energy or those that incentivize development and utilization of new, developing, or alternative sources of generation, could, and in some instances, have reduced sales, and other non-traditional procurements, such as virtual purchase power agreements, could, and in some instances have limited growth opportunities or reduced sales at the Utility operating companies. Some of these factors are inherently cyclical or temporary in nature, such as the weather or economic conditions, and rarely have a long-lasting effect on Entergy&#8217;s operating results. Others, such as the organic turnover of appliances and lighting and their replacement with more efficient ones and adoption of newer technologies, including smart thermostats, new building codes, distributed energy resources, energy storage, demand side management, and rooftop solar, are having a more permanent effect by reducing sales growth rates from historical norms. As a result of these emerging efficiencies and technologies, the Utility operating companies may lose customers or experience lower average use per customer in the residential and commercial classes, and continuing advances have the potential to further limit sales or sales growth in the future. 
The Utility operating companies also may face competition from other companies offering products and services to Entergy&#8217;s customers. Electricity sales to industrial customers, in particular, benefit from steady economic growth and favorable commodity markets; however, industrial sales are sensitive to changes in conditions in the markets in which its customers operate. Negative changes in any of these or other factors, particularly sustained economic downturns or sluggishness, have the potential to result in slower sales growth or sales declines and increased bad debt expense, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. The Utility operating companies also may not realize anticipated or expected growth in industrial sales from electrification opportunities to help such customers achieve their environmental and sustainability goals. This could occur because of changes in customers&#8217; goals or business priorities, competition from other companies, or decisions by such customers to seek to achieve such goals through methods not offered by Entergy.

Nuclear Operating, Shutdown, and Regulatory Risks 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy) 
Certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy are expected to consistently operate their nuclear power plants at high capacity factors in order to be successful, and lower capacity factors could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Nuclear capacity factors significantly affect the results of operations of certain Utility operating companies and System Energy. Nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs. Consequently, there is pressure on plant owners to operate nuclear power plants at higher capacity factors, though such operations always must be consistent with safety, reliability, and nuclear regulatory requirements. For the Utility operating companies that own nuclear plants, lower nuclear plant capacity factors can increase production costs by requiring the affected companies to generate additional energy, sometimes at higher costs, from their owned or contractually controlled facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy their supply needs. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy periodically shut down their nuclear power plants to replenish fuel. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such refueling outages. If refueling outages last longer than anticipated or if unplanned outages arise, Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected. 
Outages at nuclear power plants to replenish fuel require the plant to be &#8220;turned off.&#8221; Refueling outages generally are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such planned outages, which may extend the planned outage duration beyond that required for only refueling activities. When refueling outages last longer than anticipated or a plant experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease, and maintenance costs may increase. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy face risks related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication). These risks could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Based upon currently planned fuel cycles, Entergy&#8217;s nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what Entergy believes are reasonably predictable prices through most of 2027. Entergy&#8217;s ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners. While there are a number of possible alternate suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, the pricing of any such alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time. Entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S. Market prices for nuclear fuel have been extremely volatile from time to time in the past and may be subject to increased volatility due to the imposition of tariffs, domestic purchase requirements or limitations on importation of uranium or uranium products from foreign countries, geopolitical conditions, or shifting trade arrangements between countries. Although Entergy&#8217;s nuclear fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against market risks for several years, costs for nuclear fuel in the future cannot be predicted with certainty due to normal inherent market uncertainties, and price changes could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy. 
Entergy&#8217;s ability to assure nuclear fuel supply also depends upon the performance and reliability of conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services providers. These service providers are fewer in number than uranium suppliers. For conversion and enrichment services, Entergy diversifies its supply by supplier and country and may take special measures to ensure a reliable supply of enriched uranium for fabrication into nuclear fuel. For fabrication services, each plant is dependent upon the performance of the fabricator of that plant&#8217;s nuclear fuel; 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
therefore, Entergy relies upon additional monitoring, inspection, and oversight of the fabrication process to assure reliability and quality of its nuclear fuel. Certain of the suppliers and service providers are located in or dependent upon foreign countries, such as Russia, and international sanctions or tariffs impacting trade with such countries could further restrict the ability of such suppliers or service providers to continue to supply fuel or provide such services at acceptable prices or at all. The inability of such suppliers or service providers to perform such obligations could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy face the risk that the NRC will change or modify its regulations, suspend or revoke their licenses, or increase oversight of their nuclear plants, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Under the Atomic Energy Act and Energy Reorganization Act, the NRC regulates the operation of nuclear power plants. The NRC may modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, related regulations, or the terms of the licenses for nuclear facilities. Interested parties may also intervene which could result in prolonged proceedings. A change in the Atomic Energy Act, other applicable statutes, or the applicable regulations or licenses, or the NRC&#8217;s interpretation thereof, may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and could materially affect the results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, or System Energy. A change in the classification of a plant owned by one of these companies under the NRC&#8217;s Reactor Oversight Process, which is the NRC&#8217;s program to collect information about plant performance, assess the information for its safety significance, and provide for appropriate licensee and NRC response, also could cause the owner of the plant to incur material additional costs as a result of the increased oversight activity and potential response costs associated with the change in classification. For additional information concerning the current classification of the plants owned by Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, see &#8220; Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business - Regulation of the Nuclear Power Industry - NRC Reactor Oversight Process &#8221; in Part I, Item 1. 
Events at nuclear plants owned by one of these companies, as well as those owned by others, may lead to a change in laws or regulations or the terms of the applicable licenses, or the NRC&#8217;s interpretation thereof, or may cause the NRC to increase oversight activity or initiate actions to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility, or impose civil penalties. As a result, if an incident were to occur at any nuclear generating unit, whether an Entergy nuclear generating unit or not, it could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, or System Energy. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy are exposed to risks and costs related to operating and maintaining their nuclear power plants, and their failure to maintain operational efficiency at their nuclear power plants could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
The nuclear generating units owned by certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy began commercial operations in the 1970s-1980s. Older equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating safely and efficiently. This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages, or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in increased costs, some of which costs may not be fully recoverable by these Utility operating companies and System Energy in regulatory proceedings should there be a determination of imprudence. Operations at any of the nuclear generating units owned and operated by Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries could degrade to the point where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. If this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. A decision may be made to close a unit rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the unit to full capacity. For these Utility operating companies and System Energy, this could result in certain costs being stranded 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
and potentially not fully recoverable in regulatory proceedings. In addition, the operation and maintenance of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear facilities require the commitment of substantial human resources that can result in increased costs. 
Moreover, Entergy is becoming more dependent on fewer suppliers for key parts of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants that may need to be replaced or refurbished, and in some cases, parts are no longer available and have to be reverse-engineered for replacement. In addition, certain major parts have long lead-times to manufacture if an unplanned replacement is needed. This dependence on a reduced number of suppliers and long lead-times on certain major parts for unplanned replacements could result in delays in obtaining qualified replacement parts and, therefore, greater expense for Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, and System Energy. 
The costs associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel of certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy, as well as the costs of and their ability to fully decommission their nuclear power plants, could be significantly affected by the timing of the opening of a spent nuclear fuel disposal facility, as well as interim storage and transportation requirements. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy incur costs for the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. The approval of a license for a national repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, such as the one proposed for Yucca Mountain, Nevada, or any interim storage facility, and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. For example, while the DOE is required by law to proceed with the licensing of Yucca Mountain and, after the license is granted by the NRC, to construct the repository and commence the receipt of spent fuel, the NRC licensing of the Yucca Mountain repository is effectively at a standstill. These actions are prolonging the time before spent fuel is removed from Entergy&#8217;s plant sites. Because the DOE has not accomplished its objectives, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts, and Entergy has sued the DOE for such breach. Furthermore, Entergy is uncertain as to when the DOE will commence acceptance of spent fuel from its facilities for storage or disposal. As a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at the companies&#8217; nuclear sites and maintenance costs on existing storage facilities, including aging management of fuel storage casks, may increase. The costs of on-site storage are also affected by regulatory requirements for such storage. In addition, the availability of a repository or other off-site storage facility for spent nuclear fuel may affect the ability to fully decommission the nuclear units and the costs relating to decommissioning. For further information regarding spent fuel storage, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8211; Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#8211; Spent Fuel Disposal &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 8 to the financial statements. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy may be required to pay substantial retrospective premiums imposed under the Price-Anderson Act and/or by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL) in the event of a nuclear incident, and losses not covered by insurance could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. 
Accidents and other unforeseen problems at nuclear power plants have occurred both in the United States and elsewhere. As required by the Price-Anderson Act, the Utility operating companies and System Energy carry the maximum available amount of primary nuclear off-site liability insurance with American Nuclear Insurers, which is $450 million for each operating site. Claims for any nuclear incident exceeding that amount are covered under Secondary Financial Protection. The Price-Anderson Act limits each reactor owner&#8217;s public liability (off-site) for a single nuclear incident to the payment of retrospective premiums into a secondary insurance pool, which is referred to as Secondary Financial Protection, up to approximately $137.6 million per reactor. With 96 reactors currently participating, this translates to a total public liability cap of approximately $13 billion per incident. The limit is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation, a change in the primary limit of insurance coverage, and changes in the number of licensed reactors. As a result, in the event of a nuclear incident that causes damages (off-site) in excess of the primary insurance coverage, each owner of a nuclear plant reactor, including Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies and System Energy, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident, will be required to 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the primary insurance level, up to a maximum of approximately $137.6 million per reactor per incident (Entergy&#8217;s maximum total contingent obligation per incident is $688 million). The retrospective premium payment is currently limited to approximately $21 million per year per incident per reactor until the aggregate public liability for each licensee is paid up to the $137.6 million cap. 
NEIL is a utility industry mutual insurance company, owned by its members, including the Utility operating companies and System Energy. NEIL provides onsite property and decontamination coverage. All member plants could be subject to an annual assessment (retrospective premium of up to 10 times current annual premium for all policies) should the NEIL surplus (reserve) be significantly depleted due to &#160; insured losses. As of January 1, 2023, the maximum annual assessment amounts total approximately $70 million for the Utility plants. Retrospective premium insurance available through NEIL&#8217;s reinsurance treaty can cover the potential assessments. 
As mentioned above, as an owner of nuclear power plants, Entergy participates in industry self-insurance programs and could be liable to fund claims should a plant owned by a different company experience a major event. Any resulting liability from a nuclear accident may exceed the applicable primary insurance coverage and require contribution of additional funds through the industry-wide program that could significantly affect the results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, or System Energy. 
The decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants owned by certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy may not be adequate to meet decommissioning obligations if market performance and other changes decrease the value of assets in the decommissioning trusts, if one or more of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants is retired earlier than the anticipated shutdown date, if the plants cost more to decommission than estimated, or if current regulatory requirements change, which then could require significant additional funding. 
Owners of nuclear generating plants have an obligation to decommission those plants. Certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy maintain decommissioning trust funds for this purpose. Certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy collect funds from their customers, which are deposited into the trusts covering the units operated for or on behalf of those companies. Those rate collections, as adjusted from time to time by rate regulators, are generally based upon operating license lives and trust fund balances as well as estimated trust fund earnings and decommissioning costs. Assets in these trust funds are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns that may fall below projected return rates, and may result in losses resulting from the recognition of impairments of the value of certain securities held in these trust funds. 
Under NRC regulations, nuclear plant owners are permitted to project the NRC-required decommissioning amount, based on an NRC formula or a site-specific estimate, and the amount that will be available in each nuclear power plant&#8217;s decommissioning trusts combined with any other decommissioning financial assurances in place. The projections are made based on the operating license expiration date and the mid-point of the subsequent decommissioning process, or the anticipated actual completion of decommissioning if a site-specific estimate is used. If the projected amount of each individual plant&#8217;s decommissioning trusts exceeds the NRC-required decommissioning amount, then its NRC license termination decommissioning obligations are considered to be funded in accordance with NRC regulations. If the projected costs do not sufficiently reflect the actual costs required to decommission these nuclear power plants, or funding is otherwise inadequate, or if the formula, formula inputs, or site-specific estimate is changed to require increased funding, additional resources or commitments would be required. Furthermore, depending upon the level of funding available in the trust funds, the NRC may not permit the trust funds to be used to pay for related costs such as the management of spent nuclear fuel that are not included in the NRC&#8217;s formula. The NRC may also require a plan for the provision of separate funding for spent fuel management costs. 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Further, federal or state regulatory changes, including mandated increases in decommissioning funding or changes in the methods or standards for decommissioning operations, may also increase the funding requirements of, or accelerate the timing for funding of, the obligations related to the decommissioning of the nuclear generating plant owned by certain of the Utility operating companies or System Energy or may restrict the decommissioning-related costs that can be paid from the decommissioning trusts. Such changes also could result in the need for additional contributions to decommissioning trusts, or the posting of parent guarantees, letters of credit, or other surety mechanisms. As a result, under any of these circumstances, the results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, or System Energy could be materially affected. 
An early plant shutdown (either generally or relative to current expectations), poor investment results, or higher than anticipated decommissioning costs (including as a result of changing regulatory requirements) could cause trust fund assets to be insufficient to meet the decommissioning obligations, with the result that certain of the Utility operating companies or System Energy may be required to provide significant additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning, which, with respect to these Utility operating companies or System Energy, may not be recoverable from customers in a timely fashion or at all. 
For further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, management&#8217;s decision to exit the merchant power business, and the impairment charges that resulted from such decision, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates - Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, the &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power Business &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries, and Notes 9, 14, and 16 to the financial statements. 
New or existing safety concerns regarding operating nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel could lead to restrictions upon the operation and decommissioning of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants. 
New and existing concerns are being expressed in public forums about the safety of nuclear generating units and nuclear fuel. These concerns have led to, and may continue to lead to, various proposals to federal regulators and governing bodies in some localities where Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries own nuclear generating units for legislative and regulatory changes that might lead to the shutdown of nuclear units, additional requirements or restrictions related to spent nuclear fuel on-site storage and eventual disposal, or other adverse effects on owning, operating, and decommissioning nuclear generating units. Entergy vigorously responds to these concerns and proposals. If any of the existing proposals, or any proposals that may arise in the future with respect to legislative and regulatory changes, become effective, they could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. 
General Business 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) 
Entergy and its Registrant Subsidiaries depend on access to the capital markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could make it more difficult to handle future contingencies such as natural disasters or substantial increases in gas and fuel prices. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and the cost of capital. 
Entergy&#8217;s business is capital intensive and dependent upon its ability to access capital at reasonable rates and other terms. At times there are also spikes in the price for natural gas and other commodities that increase the liquidity requirements of the Utility operating companies. In addition, Entergy&#8217;s and the Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather-related or unforeseen disaster similar to that experienced in Entergy&#8217;s service area with Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in 2005, 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike in 2008, Hurricane Isaac in 2012, Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta in 2020, and Winter Storm Uri and Hurricane Ida in 2021. The occurrence of one or more contingencies, including an adverse decision or a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel or purchased power costs or storm restoration costs, an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines, less cash flow from operations than expected, changes in regulation or governmental policy (including tax and trade policy), or other unknown events, could cause the financing needs of Entergy and its subsidiaries to increase. In addition, accessing the debt capital markets more frequently in these situations may result in an increase in leverage. Material leverage increases could negatively affect the credit ratings of Entergy, the Utility operating companies, and System Energy, which in turn could negatively affect access to the capital markets. 
The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of high interest rates, and uncertainty or reduced liquidity in the capital markets, could negatively affect Entergy and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to maintain and to expand their businesses. Access to capital markets could be restricted and/or borrowing costs could be increased due to certain sources of debt and equity capital being unwilling to invest in offerings to fund fossil fuel projects or companies that are impacted by extreme weather events, that rely on fossil fuels, or that are impacted by risks related to climate change. Factors beyond Entergy&#8217;s control may create uncertainty that could increase its cost of capital or impair its ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on its bank credit facilities. These factors include depressed economic conditions, a recession, increasing interest rates, inflation, sanctions, trade restrictions, political instability, war, terrorism, and extreme volatility in the debt, equity, or credit markets. Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their credit facilities as they come up for renewal. Moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. If Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities, and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could impact their ability to grow their businesses, decrease earnings, significantly reduce financial flexibility, and/or limit Entergy Corporation&#8217;s ability to sustain its current common stock dividend level. 
A downgrade in Entergy&#8217;s or its Registrant Subsidiaries &#8217; credit ratings could negatively affect Entergy&#8217;s and its Registrant Subsidiaries &#8217; ability to access capital or the cost of such capital and/or could require Entergy or its subsidiaries to post collateral, accelerate certain payments, or repay certain indebtedness. 
There are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for each of Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries, including each Registrant Subsidiary&#8217;s regulatory framework, ability to recover costs and earn returns, storm risk exposure, diversification, and financial strength and liquidity. If one or more rating agencies downgrade Entergy&#8217;s or any of the Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; ratings, particularly below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and cash or letter of credit collateral demands may be triggered by the terms of a number of commodity contracts, leases, and other agreements. 
Most of Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; suppliers and counterparties require sufficient creditworthiness to enter into transactions. If Entergy&#8217;s or the Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; ratings decline, particularly below investment grade, or if certain counterparties believe Entergy or the Utility operating companies are losing creditworthiness and demand adequate assurance under fuel, gas, and purchased power contracts, the counterparties may require posting of collateral in cash or letters of credit, prepayment for fuel, gas or purchased power or accelerated payment, or counterparties may decline business with Entergy or its subsidiaries. 
Entergy or its Registrant Subsidiaries may be materially adversely affected by negative publicity or the inability to meet its stated goals or commitments, among other potential causes. 
As with any company, Entergy&#8217;s and its Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; reputations are an important element of their ability to effectively conduct their business. Entergy&#8217;s and its Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; reputations could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: failure of a generating asset or supporting infrastructure; failure to restore 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
power after a hurricane or other severe weather event in a manner perceived as timely by regulators or customers; the incurrence of storm restoration costs perceived as excessive by regulators or customers; failure to effectively manage land and other natural resources; real or perceived violations of environmental regulations, including those related to climate change; real or perceived issues with Entergy&#8217;s safety culture or work environment; inability to meet their climate or human capital strategy goals; inability to keep their electricity rates stable; involvement in a class-action or other high-profile lawsuit; significant delays in construction projects; occurrence of or responses to cyber attacks or security vulnerabilities; acts or omissions of Entergy management or acts or omissions of a contractor or other third-party working with or for Entergy or its Registrant Subsidiaries, which actually or perceivably reflect negatively on Entergy or its Registrant Subsidiaries; measures taken to offset reductions in demand or to supply rising demand; a significant dispute with one of Entergy&#8217;s or its Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; customers or other stakeholders; or negative political and public sentiment resulting in a significant amount of adverse press coverage and other adverse statements affecting Entergy or its Registrant Subsidiaries. 
Addressing any adverse publicity or regulatory scrutiny is time consuming and expensive and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made (or lack thereof), can have a negative impact on the reputations of Entergy or its Registrant Subsidiaries, on the morale and performance of their employees, and on their relationships with their respective regulators, customers, and commercial counterparties. Adverse publicity or regulatory scrutiny may also have a negative impact on Entergy or its Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; ability to take timely advantage of various business or market opportunities. 
Deterioration in Entergy&#8217;s or its Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; reputations may harm Entergy&#8217;s or its Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; relationships with their customers, regulators, and other stakeholders, may increase their cost of doing business, may interfere with its ability to attract and retain a qualified, inclusive, and diverse workforce, may impact Entergy&#8217;s or its Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; ability to raise debt capital, and may potentially lead to the enactment of new laws and regulations, or the modification of existing laws and regulations, that negatively affect the way Entergy or its Registrant Subsidiaries conduct their business, or may have a material adverse effect on their financial condition and results of operations. 
Recent U.S. tax legislation may materially adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and CARES Act of 2020 significantly changed the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, including taxation of U.S. corporations, by, among other things, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, and altering the expensing of capital expenditures. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 further significantly changed the U.S. Internal Revenue Code by, among other things, enacting a new corporate alternative minimum tax and expanding federal tax credits for clean energy production. The interpretive guidance issued by the IRS and state tax authorities may be inconsistent with Entergy&#8217;s own interpretation and the legislation could be subject to amendments, which could lessen or increase certain impacts of the legislation. Further, changes in tax legislation or guidance, or uncertainties regarding interpretation of such tax legislation or guidance, could impact interpretation of and negotiations around certain contractual arrangements with counterparties, which could result in unfavorable changes to such arrangements or delays. In addition, the retail regulatory treatment of the expanded tax credits and corporate alternative minimum tax included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 could materially impact Entergy&#8217;s future cash flows, and this legislation could result in unintended consequences not yet identified that could have a material adverse impact on Entergy&#8217;s financial results and future cash flows. 
Based on initial IRS guidance and current internal forecasts, Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries may become subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 beginning in the next two to three years. 
The tax rate decrease included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act required Entergy to record a regulatory liability for income taxes payable to customers. Such regulatory liability for income taxes is described in Note 3 to the 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
financial statements. Depending on the outcome of IRS examinations or tax positions and elections that Entergy may make, Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries may be required to record additional charges or credits to income tax expense. 
See Note 3 to the financial statements for discussion of the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on 2022, 2021, and 2020 results of operations and financial condition, the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the uncertainties associated with accounting for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the regulatory proceedings that have considered the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. For further discussion of the effects of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, see the &#8220; Income Tax Legislation &#8221; section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis and Note 3 to the financial statements. 
Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact Entergy&#8217;s and the Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes. These judgments include provisions for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. Entergy and its subsidiaries also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. Changes in federal, state, or local tax laws or interpretive guidance relating thereto, adverse tax audit results or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by Entergy and its subsidiaries could negatively affect Entergy&#8217;s and the Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. The intended and unintended consequences of recently enacted legislation could have a material adverse impact on Entergy&#8217;s financial results and future cash flows. For further information regarding Entergy&#8217;s income taxes, see Note 3 to the financial statements. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to successfully execute on their business strategies, including their ability to complete strategic transactions, is subject to significant risks, and, as a result, they may be unable to achieve some or all of the anticipated results of such strategies, which could materially affect their future prospects, results of operations, and benefits that they anticipate from such transactions. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries&#8217; future prospects and results of operations significantly depend on their ability to successfully implement their business strategies, including achieving Entergy&#8217;s climate goals and commitments, which are subject to business, regulatory, economic, and other risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond their control. As a result, Entergy and its subsidiaries may be unable to fully achieve the anticipated results of such strategies. 
Additionally, Entergy and its subsidiaries have pursued and may continue to pursue strategic transactions including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring, or other strategic transactions. For example, a significant portion of Entergy&#8217;s utility business plan over the next several years includes the construction and/or purchase of a variety of solar facilities. These or other transactions and plans are or may become subject to regulatory approval and other material conditions or contingencies, including increased costs or delays resulting from supply chain issues. The failure to complete these transactions or plans or any future strategic transaction successfully or on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; financial condition or results of operations and the market&#8217;s perception of Entergy&#8217;s ability to execute its strategy. Further, these transactions, and any completed or future strategic transactions, involve substantial risks, including the following: 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that they may encounter in acquiring or divesting a business, or engaging in other strategic transactions, which could have a material effect on their business, financial condition, or results of operations. 
The completion of capital projects, including the construction of power generation facilities, and other capital improvements, involve substantial risks. Should such efforts be unsuccessful, the financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies could be materially affected. 
Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; ability to complete capital projects, including the construction of power generation facilities, or make other capital improvements, such as transmission and distribution infrastructure replacements or upgrades, in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. These variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise, escalating costs for materials, labor, and environmental compliance, reliance on suppliers for timely and satisfactory performance, continued pandemic-related delays and cost increases, and supply chains and material constraints, including those that may result from major storm events, both within and outside of Entergy&#8217;s service area. Delays in obtaining permits, challenges in securing sufficient land for the siting of solar panels, shortages in materials and qualified labor, levels of public support or opposition, suppliers and contractors not performing as expected or required under their contracts and/or experiencing financial problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations under contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, poor quality initial cost estimates from contractors, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel costs, or materials costs, downward changes in the economy, changes in law or regulation, including environmental compliance requirements, further direct and indirect trade and tariff issues, including those associated with imported solar panels, supply chain delays or disruptions, and other events beyond the control of the Utility operating companies may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost, and performance of these projects. If these projects or other capital improvements are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, Entergy and the Utility operating companies could incur additional costs and termination payments or face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project. In addition, the Utility operating companies could be exposed to higher costs and market volatility, which could affect cash flow and cost recovery, should their respective regulators decline to approve the construction of the project or new generation needed to meet the reliability needs of customers at the lowest reasonable cost. 
For further information regarding capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital in connection with capital projects, including the potential construction and/or purchase of additional generation supply sources within the Utility operating companies&#8217; service areas, see the &#8220; Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of the Registrant Subsidiaries. 
Failure to attract, retain and manage an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively affect Entergy or its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations. 
Entergy relies on a large and changing workforce of team members, including employees, contractors, and temporary staffing. Certain factors, such as an aging workforce, mismatching of skill sets, failing to appropriately 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
anticipate future workforce needs, workforce impacts from public health concerns such as the COVID-19 pandemic and responsive measures, challenges competing with other employers offering fully remote work options, rising salary and other labor costs, or the unavailability of contract resources, may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include inability to attract or retain talent, lack of resources, loss of knowledge base, and the time required for skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, may increase. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor, may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business, especially considering the workforce needs associated with nuclear generation facilities and new skills required to develop and operate a modernized, technology-enabled, and lower carbon power grid. If Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to successfully attract, retain, and manage an appropriately qualified workforce, their results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be negatively affected. 
Entergy and Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and System Energy, may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters. 
The businesses in which Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and System Energy, operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation by local, state, and federal authorities. These laws and regulations affect the manner in which the Utility operating companies and System Energy conduct their operations and make capital expenditures. These laws and regulations also affect how Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and System Energy, manage air emissions, discharges to water, wetlands impacts, solid and hazardous waste storage and disposal, cooling and service water intake, the protection of threatened and endangered species, certain migratory birds and eagles, hazardous materials transportation, and similar matters. Federal, state, and local authorities continually revise these laws and regulations, and the laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and to the permitting and enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. Developing and implementing plans for facility compliance with these requirements can lead to capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures. Violations of these requirements can subject the Utility operating companies and System Energy to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties&#8217; claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. In addition, Entergy and its subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and System Energy, are subject to potential liability under these laws for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned or operated by the Utility operating companies and System Energy and of property potentially contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. The Utility operating companies currently are involved in proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been released and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and System Energy, have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance. 
Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury, particulates, greenhouse gases, and other regulated emissions from generating plants potentially are subject to increased regulation, controls, and mitigation expenses. In addition, existing environmental regulations and programs promulgated by the EPA often are challenged legally, or are revised or withdrawn by the EPA, sometimes resulting in large-scale changes to anticipated regulatory regimes and the resulting need to shift course, both operationally and economically, depending on the nature of the changes. Risks relating to global climate change, initiatives to regulate, or otherwise compel reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, and water availability issues are discussed below. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if Entergy and its subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, the operation of its facilities could be stopped or become subject to additional costs. For further information regarding environmental regulation and environmental matters, including Entergy&#8217;s response to climate change, see the &#8220; Regulation of Entergy &#8217; s Business &#8211; Environmental Regulation &#8221; section of Part I, Item 1. 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations may incur substantial costs related to reliability standards. 
Entergy&#8217;s business is subject to extensive and mandatory reliability standards. Such standards, which are established by the NERC, the SERC, and other regional enforcement entities, are approved by the FERC and frequently are reviewed, amended, and supplemented. Failure to comply with such standards could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of such standards. The standards, as well as the laws and regulations that govern them, are subject to judicial interpretation and to the enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. In addition to exposure to civil penalties and fines, the Utility operating companies have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to compliance with new and existing reliability standards, including costs associated with the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system and generation assets. In addition, the retail regulators of the Utility operating companies possess the jurisdiction, and in some cases have exercised such jurisdiction, to impose standards governing the reliable operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; distribution systems, including penalties if these standards are not met. The changes to the reliability standards applicable to the electric power industry are ongoing, and Entergy cannot predict the ultimate effect that the reliability standards will have on its Utility and Entergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations. 
Environmental and regulatory obligations intended to combat the effects of climate change, including by compelling greenhouse gas emission reductions or reporting, increasing clean or renewable energy requirements, or placing a price on greenhouse gas emissions, or the achievement of voluntary climate commitments could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and System Energy. 
In an effort to address climate change concerns, some federal, state, and local authorities are calling for additional laws and regulations aimed at known or suspected causes of climate change. For example, the EPA, various environmental interest groups, and other organizations have focused considerable attention on CO 2 emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. The EPA has promulgated regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from certain vehicles, and from new, existing, and significantly modified stationary sources of emissions, including electric generating units. Such regulations continue to evolve. As examples of state action, in the Northeast, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative establishes a cap on CO 2 emissions from electric power plants and requires generators to purchase emission permits to cover their CO 2 emissions, and a similar program has been developed in California. In Louisiana, the Office of the Governor announced the creation of a Climate Initiatives Task Force and issued an executive order that established a path to net-zero emissions by 2050 while the City Council of New Orleans passed a renewable and clean portfolio standard that sets a goal of net-zero emissions by 2040 and absolute zero emissions by 2050. The impact that continued changes in the governmental response to climate change risk and any judicial interpretation thereof will have on existing and pending environmental laws and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions currently is unclear. 
Developing and implementing plans for compliance with greenhouse gas emissions reduction or reporting or clean/renewable energy requirements, or for achieving voluntary climate commitments can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing facilities and proposed projects. The operations of low or non-emitting generating units (such as nuclear units) at lower than expected capacity factors could require increased generation from higher emitting units, thus increasing Entergy&#8217;s greenhouse gas emission rate. Moreover, long-term planning to meet environmental requirements can be negatively impacted and costs may increase to the extent laws and regulations change prior to full implementation. These requirements could, in turn, lead to changes in the planning or operations of balancing authorities or organized markets in areas where Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies or System Energy, do business. Violations of such requirements may subject the Utility operating companies to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties&#8217; claims for alleged health 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. Further, real or perceived violations of environmental regulations, including those related to climate change, or inability to meet Entergy&#8217;s voluntary climate commitments, could adversely impact Entergy&#8217;s reputation or inhibit Entergy&#8217;s ability to pursue its decarbonization objectives. To the extent Entergy believes any of these costs are recoverable in rates, however, additional material rate increases for customers could be resisted by Entergy&#8217;s regulators and, in extreme cases, Entergy&#8217;s regulators might attempt to deny or defer timely recovery of these costs. 
Future changes in regulation or policies governing the reporting or emission of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases or mix of generation sources could (i) result in significant additional costs to Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies, their suppliers, or customers, (ii) make some of Entergy&#8217;s electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, (iii) result in the early retirement of generation facilities and stranded costs if Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies are unable to fully recover the costs and investment in generation, and (iv) increase the difficulty that Entergy and its Utility operating companies have with obtaining or maintaining required environmental regulatory approvals, each of which could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and its subsidiaries. In addition, lawsuits have occurred or are reasonably expected against emitters of greenhouse gases alleging that these companies are liable for personal injuries and property damage caused by climate change. These lawsuits may seek injunctive relief, monetary compensation, and punitive damages. 
In March 2019, Entergy voluntarily set a climate goal to achieve a 50 percent reduction in its carbon emission rate from the year 2000 by 2030. In September 2020, Entergy voluntarily committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. In November 2022, Entergy voluntarily set a climate goal to achieve 50 percent carbon-free energy capacity by 2030. Risks to achieving the 2030 and 2050 goals include, among other things, the ability to execute on renewable resource plans, regulatory approvals, customer demand for carbon-free energy, potential tariffs, carbon policy and regulation, and supply chain costs and constraints. Technology research and development, innovation, and advancements in carbon-free generation are also critical to Entergy&#8217;s ability to achieve its 2050 commitment. Entergy cannot predict the ultimate impact of achieving these objectives, or the various implementation aspects, on its system reliability, or its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. 
The physical effects of climate change could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and its subsidiaries. 
Potential physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level, wind and storm surge damages, more frequent or intense hurricanes and wildfires, wetland and barrier island erosion, flooding and changes in weather conditions (such as increases in precipitation, drought, or changes in average temperatures), and potential increased impacts of extreme weather conditions or storms. Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries own assets in, and serve, communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, storms, and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands. A significant portion of the nation&#8217;s oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by the physical impacts of climate change, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes. Entergy and its subsidiaries also face the risk that climate change could impact the availability and quality of water supplies necessary for operations. 
These and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on the Entergy system&#8217;s ability to meet peak customer demand, more frequent and longer lasting outages, increased regulatory oversight, criticism or adverse publicity, and lower customer satisfaction. Also, to the extent that climate change adversely impacts the economic health of a region or results in energy conservation or demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and revenues. Such physical or operational risks could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Due in part to the recent increase in frequency and intensity of major storm activity along the Gulf Coast, Entergy is developing plans to accelerate investments that would enhance the resilience of the electric systems of the Utility operating companies to enable them to better withstand major storms or other adverse weather events, to enable more rapid restoration of electricity after major storm or other adverse events, and to deliver electricity to critical customers more immediately after such events. The need for this investment and these expenditures could give rise to liquidity, capital or other financing-related risks as well as result in upward pressure on the retail rates of the Utility operating companies, which, particularly when combined with upward pressure resulting from the recovery of the costs of recent and future storms, may result in adverse actions by the Utility operating companies&#8217; retail regulators or effectively limit the ability to make other planned capital or other investments. 
Continued and future availability and quality of water for cooling, process, and sanitary uses could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and its subsidiaries. 
Water is a vital natural resource that is also critical to Entergy and its subsidiaries. Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; facilities use water for cooling, boiler make-up, sanitary uses, potable supply, and many other uses. Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies also own and/or operate hydroelectric facilities. Accordingly, water availability and quality are critical to Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; business operations. Impacts to water availability or quality could negatively impact both operations and revenues. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries secure water through various mechanisms (ground water wells, surface waters intakes, municipal supply, etc.) and operate under the provisions and conditions set forth by the provider and/or regulatory authorities. Entergy and its subsidiaries also obtain and operate in substantial compliance with water discharge permits issued under various provisions of the Clean Water Act and/or state water pollution control provisions. Regulations and authorizations for both water intake and use and for waste discharge can become more stringent in times of water shortages, low flows in rivers, low lake levels, low groundwater aquifer volumes, and similar conditions. The increased use of water by industry, agriculture, and the population at large, population growth, and the potential impacts of climate change on water resources may cause water use restrictions that affect Entergy and its subsidiaries. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity prices, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
To manage near-term and medium-term financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, Entergy and its subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies, may enter into contracts to hedge portions of their purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements, and inventories of natural gas, uranium and its conversion and enrichment, coal, refined products, and other commodities, within established risk management guidelines. As part of this strategy, Entergy and its subsidiaries may utilize fixed- and variable-price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. However, Entergy and its subsidiaries normally cover only a portion of the exposure of their assets and positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. In addition, Entergy also elects to leave certain volumes during certain years unhedged. To the extent Entergy and its subsidiaries have unhedged positions, fluctuating commodity prices can materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations and financial position. 
Although Entergy and its subsidiaries devote a considerable effort to these risk management strategies, they cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these activities. As a result of these and other factors, Entergy and its subsidiaries cannot predict with precision the impact that risk management decisions may have on their business, results of operations, or financial position. 
Entergy&#8217;s over-the-counter financial derivatives are subject to rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that are designed to promote transparency, mitigate systemic risk, and protect against market abuse. Entergy cannot predict the impact any proposed or not fully-implemented final rules 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
will have on its ability to hedge its commodity price risk or on over-the-counter derivatives markets as a whole, but such rules and regulations could have a material effect on Entergy's risk exposure, as well as reduce market liquidity and further increase the cost of hedging activities. 
Entergy has guaranteed or indemnified the performance of a portion of the obligations relating to hedging and risk management activities. Reductions in Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; credit quality or changes in the market prices of energy commodities could increase the cash or letter of credit collateral required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management activities, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity and financial position. 
The Utility operating companies and Entergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations, which may materially affect the Utility operating companies and Entergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations. 
The hedging and risk management practices of the Utility operating companies and Entergy's non-regulated operations are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe Entergy and its subsidiaries money, energy, or other commodities will not perform their obligations. Currently, some hedging agreements contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure all or part of their obligations to Entergy or its subsidiaries. If the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, Entergy or its subsidiaries may enforce and recover the proceeds from the credit support provided and acquire alternative hedging arrangements, which credit support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. In such event, Entergy and its subsidiaries might incur losses in addition to amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. In addition, the credit commitments of Entergy&#8217;s lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such lenders, which could materially affect the adequacy of its liquidity sources. 
Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require additional funding and result in increased benefit plan costs. 
The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under Entergy&#8217;s pension and postretirement benefit plans. A decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements relating to Entergy&#8217;s benefit plan liabilities and also result in higher benefit costs. As the value of the assets decreases, the &#8220;expected return on assets&#8221; component of benefit costs decreases, resulting in higher benefits costs. Additionally, asset losses are incorporated into benefit costs over time, thus increasing benefits costs. Volatility in the capital markets has affected the market value of these assets, which may affect Entergy&#8217;s planned levels of contributions in the future. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Entergy&#8217;s pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding and recognition of higher liability carrying costs. The funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans can also increase as a result of changes in, among other factors, retirement rates, life expectancy assumptions, or federal regulations. For further information regarding Entergy&#8217;s pension and other postretirement benefit plans, refer to the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8211; Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of its Registrant Subsidiaries and Note 11 to the financial statements. 
The litigation environment in the states in which the Registrant Subsidiaries operate poses a significant risk to those businesses. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries and related entities are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, asbestos, hazardous material and customer matters, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters. The states in which the Registrant Subsidiaries operate have proven to be unusually litigious environments. Judges and juries in these states have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
cases. Entergy and its subsidiaries use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against them, but the litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk. 
Terrorist attacks, physical attacks, cyber attacks, system failures or data breaches of Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; or their suppliers&#8217; infrastructure or technology systems may adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s results of operations. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries operate in a business that requires evolving information technology systems that include sophisticated data collection, processing systems, software, network infrastructure, and other technologies that are becoming more complex and may be subject to mandatory and prescriptive reliability and security standards. The functionality of Entergy&#8217;s technology systems depends on its own and its suppliers&#8217; and their contractors&#8217; technology. Suppliers&#8217; and their contractors&#8217; technology systems to which Entergy is connected directly or indirectly support a variety of business processes and activities to store sensitive data, including (i) intellectual property, (ii) proprietary business information, (iii) personally identifiable information of customers, employees, and others, and (iv) data with respect to invoicing and the collection of payments, accounting, procurement, and supply-chain activities. Any significant failure or malfunction of such information technology systems could result in loss of or inappropriate access to data or disruptions of operations. 
There have been attacks and threats of attacks on energy infrastructure by cyber actors, including those associated with foreign governments. As an operator of critical infrastructure, Entergy and its subsidiaries face a heightened risk of physical attacks or acts or threats of terrorism, cyber attacks, including ransomware attacks, and data breaches, whether as a direct or indirect act against one of Entergy&#8217;s generation, transmission or distribution facilities, operations centers, infrastructure, or information technology systems used to manage, monitor, and transport power to customers and perform day-to-day business functions as well as against the systems of critical suppliers and contractors. Further, attacks may become more frequent in the future as technology becomes more prevalent in energy infrastructure. An attack could affect Entergy&#8217;s ability to operate, including its ability to operate the information technology systems and network infrastructure on which it relies to conduct business. 
Given the rapid technological advancements of existing and emerging threats, Entergy&#8217;s technology systems remain inherently vulnerable despite implementations and enhancements of the multiple layers of security and controls. If Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; technology systems, or those of critical suppliers or contractors, were compromised and unable to detect or recover in a timely fashion to a normal state of operations, Entergy or its subsidiaries could be unable to perform critical business functions that are essential to the company&#8217;s well-being and could result in a loss of or inappropriate access to its confidential, sensitive, and proprietary information, including personal information of its customers, employees, suppliers, and others in Entergy&#8217;s care. 
Any such attacks, failures, or data breaches could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation. Although Entergy and the Utility operating companies purchase insurance for cyber attacks and data breaches, such insurance prices have increased substantially, and coverage may not be adequate to cover all losses that might arise in connection with these events. Such events may also expose Entergy to an increased risk of litigation (and associated damages and fines). 
Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries are subject to risks associated with their ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs. 
The global economic cost to insurers resulting from cyber attacks, natural disasters and other catastrophic events, in addition to an increased focus on climate issues could have disruptive effects on insurance markets. The availability of insurance capacity may decrease, and the insurance policies that Entergy or the Registrant Subsidiaries are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive terms and conditions. Further, the insurance policies of Entergy or the Registrant Subsidiaries may not cover all of their potential exposures or actual amounts of losses incurred. 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Significant increases in commodity prices, other materials and supplies, and operation and maintenance expenses may adversely affect Entergy's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries have observed and expect future inflationary pressures related to commodity prices, other materials and supplies, and operation and maintenance expenses, including in the areas of labor, health care, and pension costs. The contracts for the construction of certain o f the Utility operating companies&#8217; generation facilities also have included, and in the future may include, price adjustment provisions that, subject to certain limitations, may enable the contractor to increase the contract price to reflect increases in certain costs of constructing the facility. These inflationary pressures could impact the ability of Entergy and its subsidiaries to control costs and/or make substantial investments in their businesses, including their ability to recover costs and investments, and to earn their allowed return on equity within frameworks established by their regulators while maintaining affordability of their services for their customers, in addition to having unpredictable effects on Entergy&#8217;s customers. Increases in commodity prices, other materials and supplies, and operation and maintenance expenses, including increasing labor costs and costs and funding requirements associated with Entergy's defined benefit retirement plans, health care plans, and other employee benefits, could increase their financing needs and otherwise adversely affect their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
(Entergy New Orleans) 
The effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers taking gas service may adversely affect Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s results of operations and liquidity. 
Gas rates charged to retail gas customers are comprised primarily of purchased gas cost charges, which provide no return or profit to Entergy New Orleans, and distribution charges, which provide a return or profit to the utility. Distribution charges recover fixed costs on a volumetric basis and, thus, are affected by the amount of gas sold to customers. When purchased gas cost charges increase due to higher gas procurement costs, customer usage may decrease, especially in weaker economic times, resulting in lower distribution charges for Entergy New Orleans, which, given its relatively smaller size, could adversely affect results of operations. Purchased gas cost charges, which comprise most of a customer&#8217;s bill and may be adjusted monthly, represent gas commodity costs that Entergy New Orleans recovers from its customers. Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s cash flows can be affected by differences between the time when gas is purchased and the time when ultimate recovery from customers occurs. 
(Entergy Corporation and System Energy) 
System Energy owns and, through an affiliate, operates a single nuclear generating facility, and it is dependent on sales to affiliated companies for all of its revenues. Certain contractual arrangements relating to System Energy, the affiliated companies, and these revenues are the subject of ongoing litigation and regulatory proceedings. The aggregate amount of refunds claimed in these proceedings substantially exceeds the current net book value of System Energy. In the event of an adverse decision in one or more of these proceedings requiring the payment of substantial additional refunds, System Energy would be required to seek financing to pay such refunds which financing may not be available on terms acceptable to System Energy, or may not be available at all, when required. If one or more of the foregoing events occurs, System Energy may be required to explore other options or protections available to it to extend, restructure, or retire its indebtedness and to prioritize its obligations. 
System Energy&#8217;s operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% ownership/leasehold interest in Grand Gulf. Charges under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are paid by the Utility operating companies (other than Entergy Texas) as consideration for their respective entitlements to receive capacity and energy. The useful economic life of Grand Gulf is finite and is limited by the terms of its operating license, which currently expires in November 2044. System Energy&#8217;s financial condition depends both on the receipt of payments from the Utility operating companies (other than Entergy Texas) 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and on the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf. The Unit Power Sales Agreement is currently the subject of several litigation proceedings at the FERC, including a challenge with respect to System Energy&#8217;s uncertain tax positions, sale leaseback arrangement, authorized return on equity and capital structure, a broader investigation of rates under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, and a prudence complaint challenging the extended power uprate completed at Grand Gulf in 2012 and the operation and management of Grand Gulf, particularly in the 2016-2020 time period. 
The claims in these proceedings include claims for refunds and claims for rate adjustments. The aggregate amount of refunds claimed in these proceedings substantially exceeds the current net book value of System Energy. Entergy Corporation is not obligated to provide funding to System Energy to enable it to pay any such refunds. In the event that an adverse decision in one or more of these proceedings required the payment of substantial additional refunds, System Energy would need to source additional financing to pay such refunds. Such financing may not be available on terms acceptable to System Energy, or may not be available at all, when required. An adverse development in one or more of these proceedings also could jeopardize System Energy&#8217;s ability to finance its operations and pay its obligations, at a reasonable cost or when due. If one or more of the foregoing events occurs, System Energy may be required to explore other options or protections available to it to extend, restructure, or retire its indebtedness and to prioritize its obligations. One or more rating agencies may downgrade the ratings of System Energy or its debt securities, which could adversely affect the market prices of System Energy&#8217;s debt securities and otherwise adversely affect System Energy&#8217;s financial condition. 
In addition, an order requiring System Entergy to pay substantial additional refunds could result in a default and, in certain cases, acceleration under one or more of System Energy&#8217;s existing bond indentures, credit agreements, or other financing arrangements. Certain events constituting events of default under System Energy&#8217;s financing agreements may also result in defaults under, or acceleration with respect to, financing arrangements involving certain credit agreement and guarantee obligations of Entergy Corporation. 
These proceedings are pending before their respective adjudicators and no final decisions have been reached. Thus, Entergy cannot predict with certainty the outcome of any of these proceedings, or the magnitude of any refunds or rate adjustments, and an adverse outcome in any of them could have a material adverse effect on Entergy&#8217;s or System Energy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. In particular, in connection with the uncertain tax position proceeding and related December 2022 FERC order and System Energy&#8217;s compliance report filed in January 2023, if the FERC were to order additional refunds at a level consistent with the position of the LPSC, the APSC, and the City Council on the remedy for the formerly uncertain tax positions, System Energy&#8217;s continued financial viability would be jeopardized. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the proceedings. The Utility operating companies (other than Entergy Texas) have agreed to implement certain protocols for providing retail regulators with information regarding rates billed under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. 
For information regarding the Unit Power Sales Agreement, the sale and leaseback transactions and certain other agreements relating to certain Entergy System companies&#8217; support of System Energy, see Notes 5 and 8 to the financial statements and the &#8220; Utility - System Energy and Related Agreements &#8221; section of Part I, Item 1. 
(Entergy Corporation) 
Entergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations are subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative, regulatory, or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 
Entergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations are subject to regulation under federal, state, and local laws. Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause Entergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines, and/or civil or criminal liability. 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Public utilities under the Federal Power Act are required to obtain FERC acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity. Entergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations include legal entities that meet the definition of a &#8220;public utility&#8221; under the Federal Power Act by virtue of making wholesale sales of electric energy and/or owning wholesale electric transmission facilities. The FERC has granted those entities the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. The FERC&#8217;s orders that grant those entities market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if the FERC subsequently determines that those entities can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if one of those entities were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority and potential penalties of up to $1.29 million per day per violation. If one of those entities were to lose their market-based rate authority, it would be required to obtain the FERC&#8217;s acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have an adverse effect on the rates those entities charge for power from its facilities. 
Entergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations are also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as by changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules imposed by the existing Independent System Operator. The Independent System Operator that oversees the relevant wholesale power market may impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps and other mechanisms, to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in that market. These types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on the profitability of Entergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations&#8217; generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets. 
The regulatory environment applicable to the electric power industry is subject to changes as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. Entergy cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on Entergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations. In addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism, have raised claims that the competitive marketplace is not working, and have made proposals to re-regulate the markets, impose a generation tax, or require divestitures by generating companies to reduce their market share. Other proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process, which could require material changes to business planning models. If competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, modified, discontinued, or delayed, Entergy&#8217;s non-regulated operations&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected. 
As a holding company, Entergy Corporation depends on cash distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock, and has provided, and may continue to provide, capital contributions or debt financing to its subsidiaries, which would reduce the funds available to meet its other financial obligations. 
Entergy Corporation is a holding company with no material revenue generating operations of its own or material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, all of its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. Entergy Corporation has provided, and may continue to provide, capital contributions or debt financing to its subsidiaries, which would reduce the funds available to meet its financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness, and to pay dividends on Entergy&#8217;s common stock. Entergy Corporation&#8217;s ability to satisfy its financial obligations, including the payment of interest and principal on its outstanding debt, and to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the payment to it of dividends or distributions by its subsidiaries. The subsidiaries of Entergy Corporation are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any dividends or make distributions to Entergy Corporation. The ability of such subsidiaries to make payments of dividends or distributions to Entergy

Corporation depends on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings, and on any applicable legal, regulatory, or contractual limitations on subsidiaries&#8217; ability to pay such dividends or distributions. Prior to providing funds to Entergy Corporation, such subsidiaries have financial and regulatory obligations that must be satisfied, including among others, debt service and, in the case of Entergy Utility Holding Company and Entergy Texas, dividends and distributions on preferred securities. Any distributions from the Registrant Subsidiaries other than Entergy Texas and System Energy are paid directly to Entergy Utility Holding Company and are therefore subject to prior payment of distributions on its preferred securities.

See &#8220; RISK FACTOR SUMMARY &#8221; in Part I Item 1 for a summary of Entergy&#8217;s and the Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; risk factors. 
Investors should review carefully the following risk factors and the other information in this Form 10-K. The risks that Entergy faces are not limited to those in this section. There may be additional risks and uncertainties (either currently unknown or not currently believed to be material) that could adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. See &#8220; FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION .&#8221; 
Utility Regulatory Risks 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) 
The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and responsive measures taken on Entergy&#8217;s and its Utility operating companies&#8217; business, results of operations, and financial condition are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. 
In December 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. Since then, several variants of the COVID-19 virus have spread throughout the world, including the United States. To mitigate the spread of COVID-19, public health officials in the United States have at various times both recommended and mandated wearing of masks and other precautions, including prohibitions on congregating in heavily-populated areas, closure or limitations on the functions of non-essential business, and shelter-in-place orders or similar measures, including throughout Entergy&#8217;s service areas. While many of these mitigation measures have been lifted following the wide availability of COVID-19 vaccines, there is a risk that certain of these measures could be reinstated and/or continued or that customers could elect to curtail operations to reduce the spread of an outbreak, and that such measures could have an adverse effect on the general economy, Entergy&#8217;s customers, and its operations. 
Entergy and its Utility operating companies experienced a decline in commercial and industrial sales and an increase in arrearages and bad debt expense due to non-payment by customers. Much of the commercial and industrial sales have recovered, and the arrearages have begun to decline, although management cannot predict the timing of the completion of collections of such arrearages. The Utility operating companies have resumed disconnecting customers for non-payment of bills, but such disconnects could again be suspended at the Utility operating companies by their various regulators, for various reasons, including should another shelter-in-place order or similar measure occur. While they are working with regulators to ensure ultimate recovery for those and other COVID-19 related costs, the amount, method, and timing of such recovery is subject to approval by the retail regulators. 
Entergy and its Registrant Subsidiaries also could experience, and in some cases have experienced, among other challenges, supply chain, vendor, and contractor disruptions, including shortages or delays in the availability of key components, parts and supplies such as electronic components and solar panels; delays in completion of capital or other construction projects, maintenance, and other operations activities, including prolonged or delayed refueling and maintenance outages; delays in regulatory proceedings; workforce availability challenges, including from COVID-19 infections, quarantining, or concerns with vaccination or testing mandates, health or safety issues; increased storm recovery costs; increased cybersecurity risks as a result of many employees telecommuting; risks or uncertainties associated with the return for many employees from telecommuting to on-site work on a full-time or hybrid basis; volatility in the credit or capital markets (and any related increased cost of capital or any inability to access the capital markets or draw on available credit facilities); or other adverse impacts on their ability to execute on business strategies and initiatives. 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Although the economy has been recovering, another economic decline could adversely impact Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; liquidity and cash flows, including through declining sales, reduced revenues, delays in receipts of customer payments, or increased bad debt expense. The Utility operating companies also may experience regulatory outcomes that require them to postpone planned investment and otherwise reduce costs due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their customers, especially in an increasingly inflationary environment. In addition, if the COVID-19 pandemic creates additional disruptions or turmoil in the credit or financial markets, or adversely impacts Entergy&#8217;s credit metrics or ratings, such developments could adversely affect its ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet its liquidity needs or cause a decrease in the value of its defined benefit pension trust funds, as well as its nuclear decommissioning trust funds, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. 
Entergy cannot predict the extent or duration of the outbreak, the impact of new or existing variants of COVID-19, the effectiveness of mitigation efforts, vaccines, anti-viral or other treatments for COVID-19, governmental responsive measures, or the extent of the effects or ultimate impacts on the global, national or local economy, the capital markets, or its customers, suppliers, operations, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
The terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the Utility operating companies and System Energy are determined through regulatory approval proceedings that can be lengthy and subject to appeal, potentially resulting in delays in effecting rate changes, lengthy litigation and uncertainty as to ultimate results. 
The Utility operating companies are regulated on a cost-of-service and rate of return basis and are subject to statutes and regulatory commission rules and procedures. The rates that the Utility operating companies and System Energy charge reflect their capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, allowed rates of return, financing costs, and related costs of service. These rates significantly influence the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and each of the Utility operating companies and System Energy. These rates are determined in regulatory proceedings and are subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment, including adjustment upon the initiative of a regulator or, in some cases, affected stakeholders. 
In addition, regulators may initiate proceedings to investigate the prudence of costs in the Utility operating companies&#8217; and System Energy&#8217;s base rates and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of the companies&#8217; operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures (including storm costs and costs associated with capital projects), allowed rates of return and rate base, proposed resource acquisitions, and previously incurred capital expenditures that the operating companies seek to place in rates. The regulators may disallow costs subject to their jurisdiction found not to have been prudently incurred or found not to have been incurred in compliance with applicable tariffs, creating some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or reduce rates. Traditional base rate proceedings, as opposed to formula rate plans, generally have long timelines, are primarily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited in scope or duration by statute. The length of these base rate proceedings can cause the Utility operating companies and System Energy to experience regulatory lag in recovering costs through rates, such that the Utility operating companies may not fully recover all costs during the rate effective period and may, therefore, earn less than their allowed returns. Decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings. 
The Utility operating companies have large customer and stakeholder bases and, as a result, could be the subject of public criticism or adverse publicity focused on issues including the operation and maintenance of their assets and infrastructure, their preparedness for major storms or other extreme weather events and/or the time it takes to restore service after such events, or the quality of their service. Criticism or adverse publicity of this nature could render legislatures and other governing bodies, public service commissions and other regulatory authorities, and government officials less likely to view the applicable operating company in a favorable light and could 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
potentially negatively affect legislative or regulatory processes or outcomes, as well as lead to increased regulatory oversight or more stringent legislative or regulatory requirements or other legislation or regulatory actions that adversely affect the Utility operating companies. 
The Utility operating companies and System Energy, and the energy industry as a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments, and an upward trend in spending, especially with respect to infrastructure investments, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future and could result in more frequent rate cases and requests for, and the continuation of, cost recovery mechanisms, all of which could face resistance from customers and other stakeholders especially in a rising cost environment. For information regarding rate case proceedings and formula rate plans applicable to the Utility operating companies, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 
Changes to state or federal legislation or regulation affecting electric generation, electric and natural gas transmission, distribution, and related activities could adversely affect Entergy and the Utility operating companies&#8217; financial position, results of operations, or cash flows and their utility businesses. 
If legislative and regulatory structures evolve in a manner that erodes the Utility operating companies&#8217; exclusive rights to serve their regulated customers, they could lose customers and sales and their results of operations, financial position, or cash flows could be materially affected. Additionally, technological advances in energy efficiency and distributed energy resources are reducing the costs of these technologies and together with ongoing state and federal subsidies, the increasing penetration of these technologies could result in reduced sales by the Utility operating companies. Such loss of sales could put upward pressure on rates, possibly resulting in adverse regulatory actions to mitigate such effects on rates. Further, the failure of regulatory structures to evolve to accommodate the changing needs and desires of customers with respect to the sourcing and use of electricity also could diminish sales by the operating companies. Entergy and the Utility operating companies cannot predict if or when they may be subject to changes in legislation or regulation, or the extent and timing of reductions of the cost of distributed energy resources, nor can they predict the impact of these changes on their results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 
The Utility operating companies recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or disallowance in regulatory proceedings. 
The Utility operating companies recover their fuel, purchased power, and associated costs from their customers through rate mechanisms subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. Because regulatory review can result in the disallowance of incurred costs found not to have been prudently incurred, including the cost of replacement power purchased when generators experience outages or when planned outages are extended, with the possibility of refunds to ratepayers, there exists some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs, particularly when there are substantial or sudden increases in such costs. Regulators also may initiate proceedings to investigate the continued usage or the adequacy and operation of the fuel and purchased power recovery clauses of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, there can be no assurance that existing recovery mechanisms will remain unchanged or in effect at all. 
The Utility operating companies&#8217; cash flows can be negatively affected by the time delays between when gas, power, or other commodities are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers of the costs in rates. On occasion, when the level of incurred costs for fuel and purchased power rises very dramatically, some of the Utility operating companies may agree to defer recovery of a portion of that period&#8217;s fuel and purchased power costs for recovery at a later date, which could increase the near-term working capital and borrowing requirements of those companies. For a description of fuel and purchased power recovery mechanisms and information regarding the regulatory proceedings for fuel and purchased power costs recovery, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 
The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the MISO markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs. The operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
transmission system pursuant to the MISO RTO tariff and their participation in the MISO RTO&#8217;s wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 
On December 19, 2013, the Utility operating companies integrated into the MISO RTO. MISO maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and administers wholesale energy and ancillary services markets for market participants in the MISO region, including the Utility operating companies. The Utility operating companies sell capacity, energy, and ancillary services on a bilateral basis to certain wholesale customers and offer available electricity production of their generating facilities into the MISO day-ahead and real-time energy markets pursuant to the MISO tariff and market rules. The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the MISO markets. MISO tariff rules and system conditions, including transmission congestion, could affect the Utility operating companies&#8217; ability to sell capacity, energy, and/or ancillary services in certain regions and/or the economic value of such sales, or the cost of serving the Utility operating companies&#8217; respective loads. MISO market rules may change or be interpreted in ways that cause additional cost and risk, including compliance risk. 
The Utility operating companies participate in the MISO regional transmission planning process and are subject to risks associated with planning decisions that MISO makes in the exercise of control over the planning of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission assets that are under MISO&#8217;s functional control. The Utility operating companies pay transmission rates that reflect the cost of transmission projects that the Utility operating companies do not own, which could increase cash or financing needs. Further, FERC policies and regulation addressing cost responsibility for transmission projects, including transmission projects to interconnect new generation facilities, may potentially give rise to cash and financing-related risks as well as result in upward pressure on the retail rates of the Utility operating companies, which, in turn, may result in adverse actions by the Utility operating companies&#8217; retail regulators. In addition to the cash and financing-related risks arising from the potential additional cost allocation to the Utility operating companies from transmission projects of others or changes in FERC policies or regulation related to cost responsibility for transmission projects, there is a risk that the Utility operating companies&#8217; business and financial position could be harmed as a result of lost investment opportunities and other effects that flow from an increased number of competitive projects being approved and constructed that are interconnected with their transmission systems. 
Further, the terms and conditions of the MISO tariff, including provisions related to the design and implementation of wholesale markets, the allocation of transmission upgrade costs, the MISO-wide allowed base rate of return on equity, and any required MISO-related charges and credits are subject to regulation by the FERC. The operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system pursuant to the MISO tariff and their participation in the MISO wholesale markets, and the resulting costs, may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 
In addition, orders from each of the Utility operating companies&#8217; respective retail regulators generally require that the Utility operating companies make periodic filings, or generally allow the retail regulator to direct the making of such filings, setting forth the results of analysis of the costs and benefits realized from MISO membership as well as the projected costs and benefits of continued membership in MISO and/or requesting approval of their continued membership in MISO. These filings have been submitted periodically by each of the Utility operating companies as required by their respective retail regulators, and the outcome of the resulting proceedings may affect the Utility operating companies&#8217; continued membership in MISO. 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 
A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred as a result of severe weather (including from Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, Hurricane Zeta, and Hurricane Ida), or the impact on customer bills of permitted storm cost recovery, could have material effects on Entergy and its Utility operating companies. 
Entergy&#8217;s and its Utility operating companies&#8217; results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition can be materially affected by the destructive effects of severe weather. Severe weather can also result in significant outages for the customers of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, reduced revenues for the Utility operating companies during the period of the outages. A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred or revenues lost as a result of severe weather could have a material effect on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather. In addition, the recovery of major storm restoration costs from customers could effectively limit our ability to make planned capital or other investments due to the impact of such storm cost recovery on customer bills. 
In August and October 2020, Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta caused significant damage to portions of the Utility&#8217;s service areas in Louisiana, including New Orleans, Texas, and to a lesser extent, in Arkansas and Mississippi. The storms resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage to distribution and transmission infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the outages. Additionally, as a result of Hurricane Laura&#8217;s extensive damage to the grid infrastructure serving the impacted area, large portions of the underlying transmission system required nearly a complete rebuild. Total restoration costs for the repair and/or replacement of the electrical system damaged by Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta were approximately $2.4 billion. 
In August 2021, Hurricane Ida caused extensive damage to the Entergy distribution and, to a lesser extent, transmission systems across Louisiana resulting in widespread power outages. Total restoration costs for the repair and/or replacement of the electrical system damaged by Hurricane Ida for Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans are currently estimated to be approximately $2.7 billion. Most of the storm costs were incurred by Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans. Also, Utility revenues in 2021 were adversely affected by extended power outages resulting from the hurricane. 
Because Entergy has not completed the regulatory processes regarding these storm costs, there is an element of risk, and Entergy is unable to predict with certainty the degree of success it may have in its recovery initiatives, the amount of restoration costs that it may ultimately recover, or the timing of such recovery. 
Nuclear Operating, Shutdown, and Regulatory Risks 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy) 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities must consistently operate their nuclear power plants at high capacity factors in order to be successful, and lower capacity factors could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Nuclear capacity factors significantly affect the results of operations of certain Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. Nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs. Consequently, there is pressure on plant owners to operate nuclear power plants at higher capacity factors, though such operations always must be consistent with safety, reliability, and nuclear regulatory requirements. For the Utility operating companies that own nuclear plants, lower nuclear plant capacity factors can increase production costs by requiring the affected companies to generate additional energy, sometimes at higher costs, from 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
their owned or contractually controlled facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy their supply needs. For the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant, lower capacity factors directly affect revenues and cash flow from operations. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy periodically shut down their nuclear power plants to replenish fuel. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such refueling outages. If refueling outages last longer than anticipated or if unplanned outages arise, Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected. 
Outages at nuclear power plants to replenish fuel require the plant to be &#8220;turned off.&#8221; Refueling outages generally are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such planned outages, which may extend the planned outage duration beyond that required for only refueling activities. When refueling outages last longer than anticipated or a plant experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease, and maintenance costs may increase. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy face risks related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication). These risks could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Based upon currently planned fuel cycles, Entergy&#8217;s nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what Entergy believes are reasonably predictable prices through 2021 and beyond. Entergy&#8217;s ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners. While there are a number of possible alternate suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, the pricing of any such alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time. Entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S. Market prices for nuclear fuel have been extremely volatile from time to time in the past and may be subject to increased volatility due to the imposition of tariffs, domestic purchase requirements or limitations on importation of uranium or uranium products from foreign countries, or shifting trade arrangements between countries. Although Entergy&#8217;s nuclear fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against market risks for several years, costs for nuclear fuel in the future cannot be predicted with certainty due to normal inherent market uncertainties, and price changes could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy. 
Entergy&#8217;s ability to assure nuclear fuel supply also depends upon the performance and reliability of conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services providers. These service providers are fewer in number than uranium suppliers. For conversion and enrichment services, Entergy diversifies its supply by supplier and country and may take special measures to ensure a reliable supply of enriched uranium for fabrication into nuclear fuel. For fabrication services, each plant is dependent upon the performance of the fabricator of that plant&#8217;s nuclear fuel; therefore, Entergy relies upon additional monitoring, inspection, and oversight of the fabrication process to assure reliability and quality of its nuclear fuel. Certain of the suppliers and service providers are located in or dependent upon foreign countries, such as Russia, and international sanctions or tariffs impacting trade with such countries could further restrict the ability of such suppliers to continue to supply fuel or provide such services at acceptable prices or at all. The inability of such suppliers or service providers to perform such obligations could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies and System Energy. 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business face the risk that the NRC will change or modify its regulations, suspend or revoke their licenses, or increase oversight of their nuclear plants, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Under the Atomic Energy Act and Energy Reorganization Act, the NRC regulates the operation of nuclear power plants. The NRC may modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, related regulations, or the terms of the licenses for nuclear facilities. Interested parties may also intervene which could result in prolonged proceedings. A change in the Atomic Energy Act, other applicable statutes, or the applicable regulations or licenses, or the NRC&#8217;s interpretation thereof, may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and could materially affect the results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition of Entergy (through Entergy Wholesale Commodities), its Utility operating companies, or System Energy. A change in the classification of a plant owned by one of these companies under the NRC&#8217;s Reactor Oversight Process, which is the NRC&#8217;s program to collect information about plant performance, assess the information for its safety significance, and provide for appropriate licensee and NRC response, also could cause the owner of the plant to incur material additional costs as a result of the increased oversight activity and potential response costs associated with the change in classification. For additional information concerning the current classification of the plants owned by Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see &#8220; Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business - Regulation of the Nuclear Power Industry - NRC Reactor Oversight Process &#8221; in Part I, Item 1. 
Events at nuclear plants owned by one of these companies, as well as those owned by others, may lead to a change in laws or regulations or the terms of the applicable licenses, or the NRC&#8217;s interpretation thereof, or may cause the NRC to increase oversight activity or initiate actions to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility, or impose civil penalties. As a result, if an incident were to occur at any nuclear generating unit, whether an Entergy nuclear generating unit or not, it could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities are exposed to risks and costs related to operating and maintaining their nuclear power plants, and their failure to maintain operational efficiency at their nuclear power plants could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
The nuclear generating units owned by certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, &#160; and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business began commercial operations in the 1970s-1980s. Older equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating safely and efficiently. This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages, or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in increased costs, some of which costs may not be fully recoverable by the Utility operating companies and System Energy in regulatory proceedings should there be a determination of imprudence. Operations at any of the nuclear generating units owned and operated by Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries could degrade to the point where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. If this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. A decision may be made to close a unit rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the unit to full capacity. For the Utility operating companies and System Energy, this could result in certain costs being stranded and potentially not fully recoverable in regulatory proceedings. In addition, the operation and maintenance of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear facilities require the commitment of substantial human resources that can result in increased costs. 
The nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to the effects of stress corrosion cracking and other corrosion mechanisms on certain materials within plant systems. The issue is applicable at all nuclear units to 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
varying degrees and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines that include in-service examinations, replacements, and mitigation strategies. Developments in the industry or identification of issues at the nuclear units could require unanticipated remediation efforts that cannot be quantified in advance. 
Moreover, Entergy is becoming more dependent on fewer suppliers for key parts of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants that may need to be replaced or refurbished, and in some cases, parts are no longer available and have to be reverse-engineered for replacement. In addition, certain major parts have long lead-times to manufacture if an unplanned replacement is needed. This dependence on a reduced number of suppliers and long lead-times on certain major parts for unplanned replacements could result in delays in obtaining qualified replacement parts and, therefore, greater expense for Entergy. 
The costs associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, as well as the costs of and their ability to fully decommission their nuclear power plants, could be significantly affected by the timing of the opening of a spent nuclear fuel disposal facility, as well as interim storage and transportation requirements. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Palisades plant owner incur costs for the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. The approval of a license for a national repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, such as the one proposed for Yucca Mountain, Nevada, or any interim storage facility, and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. For example, while the DOE is required by law to proceed with the licensing of Yucca Mountain and, after the license is granted by the NRC, to construct the repository and commence the receipt of spent fuel, the NRC licensing of the Yucca Mountain repository is effectively at a standstill. These actions are prolonging the time before spent fuel is removed from Entergy&#8217;s plant sites. Because the DOE has not accomplished its objectives, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts, and Entergy has sued the DOE for such breach. Furthermore, Entergy is uncertain as to when the DOE will commence acceptance of spent fuel from its facilities for storage or disposal. As a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at the companies&#8217; nuclear sites and maintenance costs on existing storage facilities, including aging management of fuel storage casks, may increase. The costs of on-site storage are also affected by regulatory requirements for such storage. In addition, the availability of a repository or other off-site storage facility for spent nuclear fuel may affect the ability to fully decommission the nuclear units and the costs relating to decommissioning. For further information regarding spent fuel storage, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8211; Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#8211; Spent Fuel Disposal &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 8 to the financial statements. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to pay substantial retrospective premiums imposed under the Price-Anderson Act and/or from Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL) in the event of a nuclear incident, and losses not covered by insurance could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. 
Accidents and other unforeseen problems at nuclear power plants have occurred both in the United States and elsewhere. As required by the Price-Anderson Act, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities carry the maximum available amount of primary nuclear off-site liability insurance with American Nuclear Insurers, which is $450 million for each operating site. Claims for any nuclear incident exceeding that amount are covered under Secondary Financial Protection. The Price-Anderson Act limits each reactor owner&#8217;s public liability (off-site) for a single nuclear incident to the payment of retrospective premiums into a secondary insurance pool, which is referred to as Secondary Financial Protection, up to approximately $137.6 million per reactor. With 95 reactors currently participating, this translates to a total public liability cap of approximately $13 billion per incident. The limit is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation, a 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
change in the primary limit of insurance coverage, and changes in the number of licensed reactors. As a result, in the event of a nuclear incident that causes damages (off-site) in excess of the primary insurance coverage, each owner of a nuclear plant reactor, including Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Palisades plant owner, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident, will be required to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the primary insurance level, up to a maximum of approximately $137.6 million per reactor per incident (Entergy&#8217;s maximum total contingent obligation per incident is $826 million). The retrospective premium payment is currently limited to approximately $21 million per year per incident per reactor until the aggregate public liability for each licensee is paid up to the $137.6 million cap. 
NEIL is a utility industry mutual insurance company, owned by its members, including the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the owners of the Palisades plant. NEIL provides onsite property and decontamination coverage. All member plants could be subject to an annual assessment (retrospective premium of up to 10 times current annual premium for all policies) should the NEIL surplus (reserve) be significantly depleted due to &#160; insured losses. As of December 31, 2021, the maximum annual assessment amounts total approximately $98 million for the Utility plants. Retrospective premium insurance available through NEIL&#8217;s reinsurance treaty can cover the potential assessments and the Palisades plant owner currently maintains the retrospective premium insurance to cover those potential assessments. 
As mentioned above, as an owner of nuclear power plants, Entergy participates in industry self-insurance programs and could be liable to fund claims should a plant owned by a different company experience a major event. Any resulting liability from a nuclear accident may exceed the applicable primary insurance coverage and require contribution of additional funds through the industry-wide program that could significantly affect the results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries. 
The decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants owned by the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may not be adequate to meet decommissioning obligations if market performance and other changes decrease the value of assets in the decommissioning trusts, if one or more of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants is retired earlier than the anticipated shutdown date, if the plants cost more to decommission than estimated, or if current regulatory requirements change, which then could require significant additional funding. 
Owners of nuclear generating plants have an obligation to decommission those plants. Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Palisades plant owner maintain decommissioning trust funds for this purpose. Certain of the Utility operating companies collect funds from their customers, which are deposited into the trusts covering the units operated for or on behalf of those companies. Those rate collections, as adjusted from time to time by rate regulators, are generally based upon operating license lives and trust fund balances as well as estimated trust fund earnings and decommissioning costs. Assets in these trust funds are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns that may fall below projected return rates, and may result in losses resulting from the recognition of impairments of the value of certain securities held in these trust funds. 
Under NRC regulations, nuclear plant owners are permitted to project the NRC-required decommissioning amount, based on an NRC formula or a site-specific estimate, and the amount that will be available in each nuclear power plant&#8217;s decommissioning trusts combined with any other decommissioning financial assurances in place. The projections are made based on the operating license expiration date and the mid-point of the subsequent decommissioning process, or the anticipated actual completion of decommissioning if a site-specific estimate is used. If the projected amount of each individual plant&#8217;s decommissioning trusts exceeds the NRC-required decommissioning amount, then its NRC license termination decommissioning obligations are considered to be funded in accordance with NRC regulations. If the projected costs do not sufficiently reflect the actual costs required to decommission these nuclear power plants, or funding is otherwise inadequate, or if the formula, formula inputs, or site-specific estimate is changed to require increased funding, additional resources or commitments would be required. Furthermore, depending upon the level of funding available in the trust funds, the NRC may not permit 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
the trust funds to be used to pay for related costs such as the management of spent nuclear fuel that are not included in the NRC&#8217;s formula. The NRC may also require a plan for the provision of separate funding for spent fuel management costs. 
Further, federal or state regulatory changes, including mandated increases in decommissioning funding or changes in the methods or standards for decommissioning operations, may also increase the funding requirements of, or accelerate the timing for funding of, the obligations related to the decommissioning of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or the Palisades plant owner or may restrict the decommissioning-related costs that can be paid from the decommissioning trusts. Such changes also could result in the need for additional contributions to decommissioning trusts, or the posting of parent guarantees, letters of credit, or other surety mechanisms. As a result, under any of these circumstances, Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially affected. 
An early plant shutdown (either generally or relative to current expectations), poor investment results, or higher than anticipated decommissioning costs (including as a result of changing regulatory requirements) could cause trust fund assets to be insufficient to meet the decommissioning obligations, with the result that the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or the Palisades plant owner may be required to provide significant additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning, which, with respect to the Utility operating companies, may not be recoverable from customers in a timely fashion or at all. 
For further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, management&#8217;s decision to exit the merchant power business, the impairment charges that resulted from such decision, and the planned sale of Palisades (which will include the transfer of the associated decommissioning trust), see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates - Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, the &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power Business &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries, and Notes 9 and 14 to the financial statements. 
New or existing safety concerns regarding operating nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel could lead to restrictions upon the operation and decommissioning of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants. 
New and existing concerns are being expressed in public forums about the safety of nuclear generating units and nuclear fuel. These concerns have led to, and may continue to lead to, various proposals to Federal regulators and governing bodies in some localities where Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries own nuclear generating units for legislative and regulatory changes that might lead to the shutdown of nuclear units, additional requirements or restrictions related to spent nuclear fuel on-site storage and eventual disposal, or other adverse effects on owning, operating, and decommissioning nuclear generating units. Entergy vigorously responds to these concerns and proposals. If any of the existing proposals, or any proposals that may arise in the future with respect to legislative and regulatory changes, become effective, they could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. 
(Entergy Corporation) 
The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative, regulatory, or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 
The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and local laws. Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines, and/or civil or criminal liability. 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Public utilities under the Federal Power Act are required to obtain FERC acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity. Each of the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants that generates electricity, as well as Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing, LLC, is a &#8220;public utility&#8221; under the Federal Power Act by virtue of making wholesale sales of electric energy and/or owning wholesale electric transmission facilities. The FERC has granted these generating and power marketing companies the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. The FERC&#8217;s orders that grant the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; generating and power marketing companies market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if the FERC subsequently determines that the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if any of its generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority and potential penalties of up to $1.29 million per day per violation. If the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; generating or power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain the FERC&#8217;s acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have an adverse effect on the rates the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business charges for power from its facilities. 
The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules imposed by the existing Independent System Operators. The Independent System Operators that oversee most of the wholesale power markets may impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps and other mechanisms, to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets. These types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on the profitability of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business&#8217; generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets. For further information regarding federal, state, and local laws and regulation applicable to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see the &#8220; Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business &#8221; section in Part I, Item 1. 
The regulatory environment applicable to the electric power industry is subject to changes as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. Entergy cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. In addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism, have raised claims that the competitive marketplace is not working because energy prices in wholesale markets exceed the marginal cost of operating nuclear power plants, and have made proposals to re-regulate the markets, impose a generation tax, or require divestitures by generating companies to reduce their market share. Other proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process, which could require material changes to business planning models. If competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, modified, discontinued, or delayed, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected.

General Business 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 
Entergy and the Utility operating companies depend on access to the capital markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could make it more difficult to handle future contingencies such as natural disasters or substantial increases in gas and fuel prices. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and the cost of capital. 
Entergy&#8217;s business is capital intensive and dependent upon its ability to access capital at reasonable rates and other terms. At times there are also spikes in the price for natural gas and other commodities that increase the liquidity requirements of the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. In addition, Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather-related or unforeseen disaster similar to that experienced in Entergy&#8217;s service territory with Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in 2005, Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike in 2008, Hurricane Isaac in 2012, Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Delta, and Hurricane Zeta in 2020, and Winter Storm Uri and Hurricane Ida in 2021. The occurrence of one or more contingencies, including a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel or purchased power costs or storm restoration costs, an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines, less cash flow from operations than expected, changes in regulation or governmental policy (including tax and trade policy), or other unknown events, could cause the financing needs of Entergy and its subsidiaries to increase. In addition, accessing the debt capital markets more frequently in these situations may result in an increase in leverage. Material leverage increases could negatively affect the credit ratings of Entergy and the Utility operating companies, which in turn could negatively affect access to the capital markets. 
The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of high interest rates, and uncertainty or reduced liquidity in the capital markets, could negatively affect Entergy and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to maintain and to expand their businesses. Access to capital markets could be restricted and/or borrowing costs could be increased due to certain sources of debt and equity capital being unwilling to invest in companies that are impacted by extreme weather events, that rely on fossil fuels or offerings to fund fossil fuel projects, or due to risks related to climate change. Events beyond Entergy&#8217;s control (including an increasing interest rate environment) may create uncertainty that could increase its cost of capital or impair its ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on its bank credit facilities. Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their credit facilities as they come up for renewal. Moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. If Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could impact their ability to grow their businesses, decrease earnings, significantly reduce financial flexibility and/or limit Entergy Corporation&#8217;s ability to sustain its current common stock dividend level. 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) 
A downgrade in Entergy Corporation &#8217; s or its subsidiaries &#8217; credit ratings could negatively affect Entergy Corporation &#8217; s and its subsidiaries &#8217; ability to access capital and/or could require Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries to post collateral, accelerate certain payments, or repay certain indebtedness. 
There are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for each of Entergy Corporation and the Registrant Subsidiaries, including each Registrant&#8217;s regulatory framework, ability to recover costs and earn returns, diversification and financial strength and liquidity. If one or more rating agencies downgrade Entergy Corporation&#8217;s, any of the Utility operating companies&#8217;, or System Energy&#8217;s ratings, particularly 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and cash or letter of credit collateral demands may be triggered by the terms of a number of commodity contracts, leases, and other agreements. 
Most of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; suppliers and counterparties require sufficient creditworthiness to enter into transactions. If Entergy Corporation&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; ratings decline, particularly below investment grade, or if certain counterparties believe Entergy Corporation or the Utility operating companies are losing creditworthiness and demand adequate assurance under fuel, gas, and purchased power contracts, the counterparties may require posting of collateral in cash or letters of credit, prepayment for fuel, gas or purchased power or accelerated payment, or counterparties may decline business with Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2021 based on power prices at that time, Entergy had liquidity exposure of $29 million under the guarantees in place supporting Entergy Wholesale Commodities transactions and $8 million of posted cash collateral. In the event of a decrease in Entergy Corporation&#8217;s credit rating to below investment grade, based on power prices as of December 31, 2021, Entergy would have been required to provide approximately $30 million of additional cash or letters of credit under some of the agreements. 
Recent U.S. tax legislation may materially adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and CARES Act of 2020 significantly changed the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, including taxation of U.S. corporations, by, among other things, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, and altering the expensing of capital expenditures. The interpretive guidance issued by the IRS and state tax authorities may be inconsistent with Entergy&#8217;s own interpretation and the legislation could be subject to amendments, which could lessen or increase certain impacts of the legislation. 
The tax rate decrease included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act required Entergy to record a regulatory liability for income taxes payable to customers. Such regulatory liability for income taxes is described in Note 3 to the financial statements. Depending on the outcome of IRS examinations or tax positions and elections that Entergy may make, Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries may be required to record additional charges or credits to income tax expense. 
See Note 3 to the financial statements for discussion of the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on 2019, 2020, and 2021 results of operations and financial condition, the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the uncertainties associated with accounting for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of the regulatory proceedings that have considered the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact Entergy&#8217;s, the Utility operating companies&#8217;, and System Energy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes. These judgments include provisions for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. Entergy and its subsidiaries also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. Changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by Entergy and its subsidiaries could negatively affect Entergy&#8217;s, the Utility operating companies&#8217;, and System Energy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. For instance, pending federal tax legislation, including the Build Back Better Act or related legislation, could significantly change the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, including the taxation of U.S. corporations, by, among other things, adopting an alternative minimum income tax on a U.S. corporation&#8217;s book income. The intended and unintended consequences 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
of this proposed legislation could have a material adverse impact on Entergy&#8217;s financial results and future cash flows. For further information regarding Entergy&#8217;s income taxes, see Note 3 to the financial statements. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to successfully execute on their business strategies, including their ability to complete strategic transactions, is subject to significant risks, and, as a result, they may be unable to achieve some or all of the anticipated results of such strategies, which could materially affect their future prospects, results of operations, and benefits that they anticipate from such transactions. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries&#8217; future prospects and results of operations significantly depend on their ability to successfully implement their business strategies, which are subject to business, regulatory, economic, and other risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond their control. As a result, Entergy and its subsidiaries may be unable to fully achieve the anticipated results of such strategies. 
Additionally, Entergy and its subsidiaries have pursued and may continue to pursue strategic transactions including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring, or other strategic transactions. For example, Entergy has entered into an agreement to sell its equity interests in the subsidiary that owns Palisades and the decommissioned Big Rock Point Nuclear Power Plant after Palisades has been shut down and defueled. Also, a significant portion of Entergy&#8217;s utility business plan over the next several years includes the construction and/or purchase of a variety of solar facilities. These or other transactions and plans are or may become subject to regulatory approval and other material conditions or contingencies, including increased costs or delays resulting from supply chain issues. The failure to complete these transactions or plans or any future strategic transaction successfully or on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; financial condition or results of operations and the market&#8217;s perception of Entergy&#8217;s ability to execute its strategy. Further, these transactions, and any completed or future strategic transactions, involve substantial risks, including the following: 
Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that they may encounter in acquiring or divesting a business, or engaging in other strategic transactions, which could have a material effect on their business, financial condition or results of operations. 
The completion of capital projects, including the construction of power generation facilities, and other capital improvements involve substantial risks. Should such efforts be unsuccessful, the financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies could be materially affected. 
Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; ability to complete capital projects, including the construction of power generation facilities, or make other capital improvements, in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. These variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise, escalating costs for materials, labor, and environmental compliance, 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
reliance on suppliers for timely and satisfactory performance, and pandemic-related delays and cost increases. Delays in obtaining permits, shortages in materials and qualified labor, levels of public support or opposition, suppliers and contractors not performing as expected or required under their contracts and/or experiencing financial problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations under contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, poor quality initial cost estimates from contractors, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel costs, or materials costs, downward changes in the economy, changes in law or regulation, including environmental compliance requirements, supply chain delays or disruptions, and other events beyond the control of the Utility operating companies or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost, and performance of these projects. If these projects or other capital improvements are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, Entergy and the Utility operating companies could incur additional costs and termination payments, or face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project. In addition, the Utility operating companies could be exposed to higher costs and market volatility, which could affect cash flow and cost recovery, should their respective regulators decline to approve the construction of the project or new generation needed to meet the reliability needs of customers at the lowest reasonable cost. 
For further information regarding capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital in connection with capital projects, including the potential construction and/or purchase of additional generation supply sources within the Utility operating companies&#8217; service territory, and as to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see the &#8220; Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of the Registrant Subsidiaries. 
Failure to attract, retain and manage an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively affect Entergy or its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations. 
Entergy relies on a large and changing workforce of team members, including employees, contractors and temporary staffing. Certain factors, such as an aging workforce, mismatching of skill sets, failing to appropriately anticipate future workforce needs, workforce impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and responsive measures, challenges competing with other employers offering fully remote work options, rising salary and other labor costs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include inability to attract or retain talent, lack of resources, loss of knowledge base, and the time required for skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs, and safety costs, may increase. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business, especially considering the workforce needs associated with nuclear generation facilities and new skills required to develop and operate a modernized, technology-enabled, and lower carbon power grid. If Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to successfully attract, retain, and manage an appropriately qualified workforce, their results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be negatively affected. 
The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters. 
The businesses in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation by local, state, and federal authorities. These laws and regulations affect the manner in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business conduct their operations and make capital expenditures. These laws and regulations also affect how the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business manage air emissions, discharges to water, wetlands impacts, solid and hazardous waste storage and disposal, cooling and service water intake, the protection of threatened and endangered species, certain migratory birds and eagles, hazardous materials transportation, and similar matters. Federal, state, and local authorities continually revise these laws and regulations, and the laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and to the permitting and enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. Developing 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
and implementing plans for facility compliance with these requirements can lead to capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures. Violations of these requirements can subject the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties&#8217; claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. In addition, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business potentially are subject to liability under these laws for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned or operated by the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. The Utility operating companies currently are involved in proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been released and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance. 
Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury, particulates, greenhouse gases, and other regulated emissions from generating plants potentially are subject to increased regulation, controls, and mitigation expenses. In addition, existing environmental regulations and programs promulgated by the EPA often are challenged legally, or are revised or withdrawn by the EPA, sometimes resulting in large-scale changes to anticipated regulatory regimes and the resulting need to shift course, both operationally and economically, depending on the nature of the changes. Risks relating to global climate change, initiatives to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions, and water availability issues are discussed below. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if Entergy and its subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, the operation of its facilities could be stopped or become subject to additional costs. For further information regarding environmental regulation and environmental matters, including Entergy&#8217;s response to climate change, see the &#8220; Regulation of Entergy &#8217; s Business &#8211; Environmental Regulation &#8221; section of Part I, Item 1. 
The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs related to reliability standards. 
Entergy&#8217;s business is subject to extensive and mandatory reliability standards. Such standards, which are established by the NERC, the SERC, and other regional enforcement entities, are approved by the FERC and frequently are reviewed, amended, and supplemented. Failure to comply with such standards could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of such standards. The standards, as well as the laws and regulations that govern them, are subject to judicial interpretation and to the enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. In addition to exposure to civil penalties and fines, the Utility operating companies have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to compliance with new and existing reliability standards, including costs associated with the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system and generation assets. In addition, the retail regulators of the Utility operating companies possess the jurisdiction, and in some cases have exercised such jurisdiction, to impose standards governing the reliable operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; distribution systems, including penalties if these standards are not met. The changes to the reliability standards applicable to the electric power industry are ongoing, and Entergy cannot predict the ultimate effect that the reliability standards will have on its Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities businesses. 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 
Weather, economic conditions, technological developments, and other factors may have a material impact on electricity and gas sales and otherwise materially affect the Utility operating companies &#8217; results of operations and system reliability. 
Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase electric cooling demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels in the winter tend to increase electric and gas heating demand and revenues. As a corollary, mild temperatures in either season tend to decrease energy usage and resulting revenues. Higher consumption levels coupled with seasonal pricing differentials typically cause the Utility operating companies to report higher revenues in the third quarter of the fiscal year than in the other quarters. Changing weather patterns and extreme weather conditions including hurricanes or tropical storms, flooding events, or ice storms may stress the Utility operating companies&#8217; generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on their ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, criticism or adverse publicity, and reduced customer satisfaction. These extreme conditions could have a material effect on the Utility operating companies&#8217; financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
Entergy&#8217;s electricity sales volumes are affected by a number of factors including weather and economic conditions, trends in energy efficiency, new technologies, and self-generation alternatives, including the willingness and ability of large industrial customers to develop co-generation facilities that greatly reduce their grid demand. In addition, changes to regulatory policies, such as those that allow customers to directly access the market to procure wholesale energy, could reduce sales, and other non-traditional procurements, such as virtual purchase power agreements, could limit growth opportunities at the Utility operating companies. Some of these factors are inherently cyclical or temporary in nature, such as the weather or economic conditions, and rarely have a long-lasting effect on Entergy&#8217;s operating results. Others, such as the organic turnover of appliances and lighting and their replacement with more efficient ones, adoption of newer technologies including smart thermostats, new building codes, distributed energy resources, energy storage, demand side management, and rooftop solar are having a more permanent effect by reducing sales growth rates from historical norms. As a result of these emerging efficiencies and technologies, the Utility operating companies may lose customers or experience lower average use per customer in the residential and commercial classes, and continuing advances have the potential to further limit sales growth in the future. 
The Utility operating companies also may face competition from other companies offering products and services to Entergy&#8217;s customers. Electricity sales to industrial customers, in particular, benefit from steady economic growth and favorable commodity markets; however, industrial sales are sensitive to changes in conditions in the markets in which its customers operate. Negative changes in any of these or other factors, particularly sustained economic downturns or sluggishness, have the potential to result in slower sales growth or sales declines and increased bad debt expense, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. The Utility operating companies also may not realize anticipated or expected growth in industrial sales from electrification opportunities to help such customers achieve their environmental and sustainability goals. This could occur because of changes in customers&#8217; goals or business priorities, competition from other companies or decisions by such customers to seek to achieve such goals through methods not offered by Entergy. 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
The effects of climate change, environmental and regulatory obligations intended to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions or increase clean or renewable energy requirements or to place a price on greenhouse gas emissions, or achieving voluntary climate commitments could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. 
In an effort to address climate change concerns, some federal, state, and local authorities are calling for additional laws and regulations aimed at known or suspected causes of climate change. For example, the EPA, various environmental interest groups, and other organizations have focused considerable attention on CO 2 emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. The EPA has promulgated regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from certain vehicles, and from new, existing, and significantly modified stationary sources of emissions, including electric generating units. As examples of state action, in the Northeast, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative establishes a cap on CO 2 emissions from electric power plants and requires generators to purchase emission permits to cover their CO 2 emissions, and a similar program has been developed in California. In Louisiana, the Office of the Governor announced the creation of a Climate Initiatives Task Force and issued an executive order that established a path to net-zero emissions by 2050 while the City Council of New Orleans passed a renewable and clean portfolio standard that sets a goal of net-zero emissions by 2040 and absolute zero emissions by 2050. The impact that continued changes in the governmental response to climate change risk will have on existing and pending environmental laws and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions currently is unclear. 
Developing and implementing plans for compliance with greenhouse gas emissions reduction or clean/renewable energy requirements, or for achieving voluntary climate commitments can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing facilities and proposed projects. The operations of low or non-emitting generating units (such as nuclear units) at lower than expected capacity factors could require increased generation from higher emitting units, thus increasing Entergy&#8217;s greenhouse gas emission rate. Moreover, long-term planning to meet environmental requirements can be negatively impacted and costs may increase to the extent laws and regulations change prior to full implementation. These requirements could, in turn, lead to changes in the planning or operations of balancing authorities or organized markets in areas where the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or Entergy Wholesale Commodities do business. Violations of such requirements may subject Entergy Wholesale Commodities and the Utility operating companies to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties&#8217; claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. Further, real or perceived violations of environmental regulations, including those related to climate change, or inability to meet voluntary climate commitments, could adversely impact Entergy&#8217;s reputation or inhibit Entergy&#8217;s ability to pursue its decarbonization objectives. To the extent Entergy believes any of these costs are recoverable in rates, however, additional material rate increases for customers could be resisted by Entergy&#8217;s regulators and, in extreme cases, Entergy&#8217;s regulators might attempt to deny or defer timely recovery of these costs. 
Future changes in regulation or policies governing the emission of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases or mix of generation sources could (i) result in significant additional costs to Entergy&#8217;s utility operating companies, their suppliers or customers, (ii) make some of Entergy&#8217;s electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, (iii) result in the early retirement of generation facilities and stranded costs if Entergy&#8217;s utility operating companies are unable to fully recover the costs and investment in generation and (iv) could increase the difficulty that Entergy and its utility operating companies have with obtaining or maintaining required environmental regulatory approvals, each of which could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and its subsidiaries. In addition, lawsuits have occurred or are reasonably expected against emitters of greenhouse gases alleging that these companies are liable for personal injuries and property damage caused by climate change. These lawsuits may seek injunctive relief, monetary compensation, and punitive damages. 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
In September 2020, Entergy voluntarily committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Technology research and development, innovation, and advancement are critical to Entergy&#8217;s ability to achieve this commitment. Moreover, Entergy cannot predict the ultimate impact of achieving this objective, or the various implementation aspects, on its system reliability, or its results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
The physical effects of climate change could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. 
Potential physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level, wind and storm surge damages, more frequent or intense hurricanes and wildfires, wetland and barrier island erosion, risks of flooding and changes in weather conditions, (such as increases in precipitation, drought, or changes in average temperatures), and potential increased impacts of extreme weather conditions or storms. Entergy subsidiaries own assets in, and serve, communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, storms, and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands. A significant portion of the nation&#8217;s oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by the physical impacts of climate change, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes. Entergy and its subsidiaries also face the risk that climate change could impact the availability and quality of water supplies necessary for operations. 
These and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on the Entergy System&#8217;s ability to meet peak customer demand, more frequent and longer lasting outages, increased regulatory oversight, criticism or adverse publicity, and lower customer satisfaction. Also, to the extent that climate change adversely impacts the economic health of a region or results in energy conservation or demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and revenues. Such physical or operational risks could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217;, System Energy&#8217;s, and the Utility operating companies&#8217; financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
Due in part to the recent increase in frequency and intensity of major storm activity along the Gulf Coast, Entergy is developing plans to accelerate investments that would enhance the resilience of the electric systems of the Utility operating companies to enable them to better withstand major storms or other adverse weather events, to enable more rapid restoration of electricity after major storm or other adverse events, and to deliver electricity to critical customers more immediately after such events. The need for this investment and these expenditures could give rise to liquidity, capital or other financing-related risks as well as result in upward pressure on the retail rates of the Utility operating companies, which, particularly when combined with upward pressure resulting from the recovery of the costs of recent and future storms, may result in adverse actions by the Utility operating companies&#8217; retail regulators or effectively limit the ability to make other planned capital or other investments. 
Continued and future availability and quality of water for cooling, process, and sanitary uses could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. 
Water is a vital natural resource that is also critical to the Utility operating companies&#8217;, System Energy&#8217;s, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; business operations. Entergy&#8217;s facilities use water for cooling, boiler make-up, sanitary uses, potable supply, and many other uses. Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies also own and/or operate hydroelectric facilities. Accordingly, water availability and quality are critical to Entergy&#8217;s business operations. Impacts to water availability or quality could negatively impact both operations and revenues. 
Entergy secures water through various mechanisms (ground water wells, surface waters intakes, municipal supply, etc.) and operates under the provisions and conditions set forth by the provider and/or regulatory authorities. Entergy also obtains and operates in substantial compliance with water discharge permits issued under 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
various provisions of the Clean Water Act and/or state water pollution control provisions. Regulations and authorizations for both water intake and use and for waste discharge can become more stringent in times of water shortages, low flows in rivers, low lake levels, low groundwater aquifer volumes, and similar conditions. The increased use of water by industry, agriculture, and the population at large, population growth, and the potential impacts of climate change on water resources may cause water use restrictions that affect Entergy and its subsidiaries. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity prices, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
To manage near-term and medium-term financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, Entergy and its subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, may enter into contracts to hedge portions of their purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements, and inventories of natural gas, uranium and its conversion and enrichment, coal, refined products, and other commodities, within established risk management guidelines. As part of this strategy, Entergy and its subsidiaries may utilize fixed- and variable-price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. However, Entergy and its subsidiaries normally cover only a portion of the exposure of their assets and positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. In addition, Entergy also elects to leave certain volumes during certain years unhedged. To the extent Entergy and its subsidiaries have unhedged positions, fluctuating commodity prices can materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations and financial position. 
Although Entergy and its subsidiaries devote a considerable effort to these risk management strategies, they cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these activities. As a result of these and other factors, Entergy and its subsidiaries cannot predict with precision the impact that risk management decisions may have on their business, results of operations, or financial position. 
Entergy&#8217;s over-the-counter financial derivatives are subject to rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that are designed to promote transparency, mitigate systemic risk, and protect against market abuse. Entergy cannot predict the impact any proposed or not fully-implemented final rules will have on its ability to hedge its commodity price risk or on over-the-counter derivatives markets as a whole, but such rules and regulations could have a material effect on Entergy's risk exposure, as well as reduce market liquidity and further increase the cost of hedging activities. 
Entergy has guaranteed or indemnified the performance of a portion of the obligations relating to hedging and risk management activities. Reductions in Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; credit quality or changes in the market prices of energy commodities could increase the cash or letter of credit collateral required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management activities, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity and financial position. 
The Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations, which may materially affect the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
The hedging and risk management practices of the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe Entergy and its subsidiaries money, energy, or other commodities will not perform their obligations. Currently, some hedging agreements contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure all or part of their obligations to Entergy or its subsidiaries. If the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, Entergy or its subsidiaries may enforce and recover the proceeds from the credit support provided and acquire alternative hedging arrangements, which credit support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. In such event, Entergy and its subsidiaries might incur losses in addition to amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. In 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
addition, the credit commitments of Entergy&#8217;s lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such lenders, which could materially affect the adequacy of its liquidity sources. 
Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require additional funding and result in increased benefit plan costs. 
The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under Entergy&#8217;s pension and postretirement benefit plans. A decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements relating to Entergy&#8217;s benefit plan liabilities and also result in higher benefit costs. As the value of the assets decreases, the &#8220;expected return on assets&#8221; component of benefit costs decreases, resulting in higher benefits costs. Additionally, asset losses are incorporated into benefit costs over time, thus increasing benefits costs. Volatility in the capital markets has affected the market value of these assets, which may affect Entergy&#8217;s planned levels of contributions in the future. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Entergy&#8217;s pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding and recognition of higher liability carrying costs. The funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans can also increase as a result of changes in, among other factors, retirement rates, life expectancy assumptions, or Federal regulations. For further information regarding Entergy&#8217;s pension and other postretirement benefit plans, refer to the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8211; Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of its Registrant Subsidiaries and Note 11 to the financial statements. 
The litigation environment in the states in which certain Entergy subsidiaries operate poses a significant risk to those businesses. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries and related entities are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, asbestos, hazardous material and ratepayer matters, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters. The states in which the Utility operating companies operate have proven to be unusually litigious environments. Judges and juries in these states have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort cases. Entergy and its subsidiaries use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against them, but the litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk. 
Terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, system failures or data breaches of Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; or our suppliers&#8217; technology systems may adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s results of operations. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries operate in a business that requires evolving information technology systems that include sophisticated data collection, processing systems, software, network infrastructure, and other technologies that are becoming more complex and may be subject to mandatory and prescriptive reliability and security standards. The functionality of Entergy&#8217;s technology systems depends on its own and its suppliers&#8217; and their contractors&#8217; technology. Suppliers&#8217; and their contractors&#8217; technology systems to which Entergy is connected directly or indirectly support a variety of business processes and activities to store sensitive data, including (i) intellectual property, (ii) proprietary business information, (iii) personally identifiable information of customers and employees, and (iv) data with respect to invoicing and the collection of payments, accounting, procurement, and supply-chain activities. Any significant failure or malfunction of such information technology systems could result in loss of or inappropriate access to data or disruptions of operations. 
There have been attacks and threats of attacks on energy infrastructure by cyber actors, including those associated with foreign governments. As an operator of critical infrastructure, Entergy and its subsidiaries face a heightened risk of an act or threat of terrorism, cyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks, and data breaches, whether as a direct or indirect act against one of Entergy&#8217;s generation, transmission or distribution facilities, operations centers, infrastructure, or information technology systems used to manage, monitor, and transport power to customers and perform day-to-day business functions as well as against the systems of critical suppliers and 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
contractors. Further, attacks may become more frequent in the future as technology becomes more prevalent in energy infrastructure. An actual act could affect Entergy&#8217;s ability to operate, including its ability to operate the information technology systems and network infrastructure on which it relies to conduct business. 
Given the rapid technological advancements of existing and emerging threats, Entergy&#8217;s technology systems remain inherently vulnerable despite implementations and enhancements of the multiple layers of security and controls. If Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; technology systems, or those of critical suppliers or contractors, were compromised and unable to detect or recover in a timely fashion to a normal state of operations, Entergy or its subsidiaries could be unable to perform critical business functions that are essential to the company&#8217;s well-being and could result in a loss of or inappropriate access to its confidential, sensitive, and proprietary information, including personal information of its customers, employees, suppliers, and others in Entergy&#8217;s care. 
Any such attacks, failures, or data breaches could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation. Although Entergy and the Utility operating companies purchase insurance coverage for cyber-attacks or data breaches, such insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses that might arise in connection with these events. Such events may also expose Entergy to an increased risk of litigation (and associated damages and fines). 
Significant increases in commodity prices, other materials and supplies, and operation and maintenance expenses may adversely affect Entergy's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries have observed and expect future inflationary pressures related to commodity prices, other materials and supplies, and operation and maintenance expenses, including in the areas of labor, health care, and pension costs. The contracts for the construction of certain o f the Utility operating companies&#8217; generation facilities also have included, and in the future may include, price adjustment provisions that, subject to certain limitations, may enable the contractor to increase the contract price to reflect increases in certain costs of constructing the facility. These inflationary pressures could impact the ability of Entergy and its subsidiaries to control costs and/or make substantial investments in its businesses, including their ability to recover costs and investments, and to earn their allowed return on equity within frameworks established by their regulators while maintaining affordability of their services for its customers. Increases in commodity prices, other materials and supplies, and operation and maintenance expenses, including increasing labor costs and costs and funding requirements associated with Entergy's defined benefit retirement plans, health care plans, and other employee benefits, could increase their financing needs and otherwise adversely affect their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
(Entergy New Orleans) 
The effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers taking gas service may adversely affect Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s results of operations and liquidity. 
Gas rates charged to retail gas customers are comprised primarily of purchased gas cost charges, which provide no return or profit to Entergy New Orleans, and distribution charges, which provide a return or profit to the utility. Distribution charges recover fixed costs on a volumetric basis and, thus, are affected by the amount of gas sold to customers. When purchased gas cost charges increase due to higher gas procurement costs, customer usage may decrease, especially in weaker economic times, resulting in lower distribution charges for Entergy New Orleans, which, given its relatively smaller size, could adversely affect results of operations. Purchased gas cost charges, which comprise most of a customer&#8217;s bill and may be adjusted monthly, represent gas commodity costs that Entergy New Orleans recovers from its customers. Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s cash flows can be affected by differences between the time period when gas is purchased and the time when ultimate recovery from customers occurs. 
Part I Item 1A and 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
(Entergy Corporation and System Energy) 
System Energy owns and, through an affiliate, operates a single nuclear generating facility, and it is dependent on sales to affiliated companies for all of its revenues. Certain contractual arrangements relating to System Energy, the affiliated companies, and these revenues are the subject of ongoing litigation and regulatory proceedings. 
System Energy&#8217;s operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% ownership/leasehold interest in Grand Gulf. Charges under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are paid by the Utility operating companies as consideration for their respective entitlements to receive capacity and energy. The useful economic life of Grand Gulf is finite and is limited by the terms of its operating license, which currently expires in November 2044. System Energy&#8217;s financial condition depends both on the receipt of payments from the Utility operating companies under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and on the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf. The Unit Power Sales Agreement is currently the subject of several litigation proceedings at the FERC, including a challenge with respect to System Energy&#8217;s uncertain tax positions, sale leaseback arrangement, authorized return on equity and capital structure, a broader investigation of rates under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, and a prudence complaint challenging the extended power uprate completed at Grand Gulf in 2012 and the operation and management of Grand Gulf, particularly in the 2016-2020 time period. The claims in these proceedings include claims for refunds and claims for rate adjustments; the aggregate amount of refunds claimed in these proceedings substantially exceeds the net book value of System Energy. Entergy cannot predict the outcome of any of these proceedings, and an adverse outcome in any of them could have a material adverse effect on Entergy&#8217;s or System Energy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the proceedings. The Utility operating companies have agreed to implement certain protocols for providing retail regulators with information regarding rates billed under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. 
For information regarding the Unit Power Sales Agreement, the sale and leaseback transactions and certain other agreements relating to the Entergy System companies&#8217; support of System Energy, see Notes 5 and 8 to the financial statements and the &#8220; Utility - System Energy and Related Agreements &#8221; section of Part I, Item 1. 
(Entergy Corporation) 
As a holding company, Entergy Corporation depends on cash distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock. 
Entergy Corporation is a holding company with no material revenue generating operations of its own or material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, all of its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. Entergy Corporation&#8217;s ability to satisfy its financial obligations, including the payment of interest and principal on its outstanding debt, and to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the payment to it of dividends or distributions by its subsidiaries. The subsidiaries of Entergy Corporation are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any dividends or make distributions to Entergy Corporation. The ability of such subsidiaries to make payments of dividends or distributions to Entergy Corporation depends on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings, and on any applicable legal, regulatory, or contractual limitations on subsidiaries&#8217; ability to pay such dividends or distributions. Prior to providing funds to Entergy Corporation, such subsidiaries have financial and regulatory obligations that must be satisfied, including among others, debt service and, in the case of Entergy Utility Holding Company and Entergy Texas, dividends and distributions on preferred securities. Any distributions from the Registrant Subsidiaries other than Entergy Texas and System Energy are paid directly to Entergy Utility Holding Company and are therefore subject to prior payment of distributions on its preferred securities.

ENTERGY&#8217;S BUSINESS 
Entergy is an integrated energy company engaged primarily in electric power production and retail distribution operations. Entergy owns and operates power plants with approximately 30,000 MW of electric generating capacity, including approximately 8,000 MW of nuclear power. Entergy delivers electricity to 3.0 million utility customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Entergy had annual revenues of $10.1 billion in 2020 and had more than 13,000 employees as of December 31, 2020. 
Entergy operates primarily through two business segments: Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
See Note 13 to the financial statements for financial information regarding Entergy&#8217;s business segments. 
Strategy 
Entergy&#8217;s strategy is to operate and grow the premier utility business that creates sustainable value for its customers, employees, communities, and owners. Entergy&#8217;s strategy to achieve its stakeholder objectives has two key aspects. First, Entergy invests in the Utility for the benefit of its customers, which supports steady, predictable growth in earnings and dividends. Second, Entergy manages risks by ensuring its Utility investments are customer-centric, supported by progressive regulatory constructs, and executed with disciplined project management. Entergy&#8217;s strategy for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business segment is to continue to manage the risk of its operating portfolio as Entergy completes its exit from the merchant power business. 
Utility 
The Utility business segment includes five retail electric utility subsidiaries: Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas. These companies generate, transmit, distribute, and sell electric power to retail and wholesale customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans also provide natural gas utility services to customers in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and New Orleans, Louisiana, respectively. Also included in the Utility is System Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Corporation that owns or leases 90 percent of Grand Gulf. System Energy sells its power and capacity from Grand Gulf at wholesale to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans. The five retail utility subsidiaries are each regulated by the FERC and by state utility commissions, or, in the case of Entergy New Orleans, the City Council. System Energy is regulated by the FERC because all of its transactions are at wholesale. The overall generation portfolio of the Utility, which relies heavily on natural gas and nuclear generation, is consistent with Entergy&#8217;s strong support for the environment.

Part I Item 1 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Entergy Arkansas 
Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery 
Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s rate schedules include an energy cost recovery rider to recover fuel and purchased power costs in monthly bills. The rider utilizes prior calendar year energy costs and projected energy sales for the twelve-month period commencing on April 1 of each year to develop an energy cost rate, which is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over-recovery or under-recovery, including carrying charges, of the energy cost for the prior calendar year. The energy cost recovery rider tariff also allows an interim rate request depending upon the level of over- or under-recovery of fuel and purchased energy costs. In December 2007 the APSC issued an order stating that Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s energy cost recovery rider will remain in effect, and any future termination of the rider would be subject to eighteen months advance notice by the APSC, which would occur following notice and hearing. 
Production Cost Allocation Rider 
Entergy Arkansas has in place an APSC-approved production cost allocation rider for recovery from customers of the retail portion of the costs allocated to Entergy Arkansas as a result of System Agreement proceedings. 
Entergy Louisiana 
Fuel Recovery 
Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s rate schedules include a fuel adjustment clause designed to recover the cost of fuel and purchased power costs. The fuel adjustment clause contains a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense and related carrying charges arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of proceedings related to audits of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s fuel adjustment clause filings. 
To help stabilize electricity costs, Entergy Louisiana received approval from the LPSC to hedge its exposure to natural gas price volatility through the use of financial instruments. Entergy Louisiana historically hedged approximately one-third of the projected exposure to natural gas price changes for the gas used to serve its native electric load for all months of the year. The hedge quantity was reviewed on an annual basis. In January 2018, Entergy Louisiana filed an application with the LPSC to suspend these seasonal hedging programs and implement financial hedges with terms up to five years for a portion of its natural gas exposure, which was approved in November 2018. 
Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s gas rates include a purchased gas adjustment clause based on estimated gas costs for the billing month adjusted by a surcharge or credit that arises from an annual reconciliation of fuel costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges. 
Retail Rates - Gas 
In accordance with the settlement of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana&#8217;s gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2012, in August 2014, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana submitted for consideration a proposal for implementation of an infrastructure rider to recover expenditures associated with strategic plant investment and relocation projects mandated by local governments. After review by the LPSC staff and inclusion of certain customer safeguards required by the LPSC staff, in December 2014, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC staff submitted a joint settlement for implementation of an accelerated gas pipe replacement program providing for the replacement of approximately 100 miles of pipe over the next ten years, as well as relocation of certain existing pipe resulting from local government-related infrastructure projects, and for a rider to recover the 
Part I Item 1

investment associated with these projects. The rider allows for recovery of approximately $65 million over ten years. The rider recovery will be adjusted on a quarterly basis to include actual investment incurred for the prior quarter and is subject to the following conditions, among others: a ten-year term; application of any earnings in excess of the upper end of the earnings band as an offset to the revenue requirement of the infrastructure rider; adherence to a specified spending plan, within plus or minus 20% annually; annual filings comparing actual versus planned rider spending with actual spending and explanation of variances exceeding 10%; and an annual true-up. The joint settlement was approved by the LPSC in January 2015. Implementation of the infrastructure rider commenced with bills rendered on and after the first billing cycle of April 2015. 
Storm Cost Recovery 
See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s filings to recover storm-related costs. 
Other 
In March 2016 the LPSC opened two dockets to examine, on a generic basis, issues that it identified in connection with its review of Cleco Corporation&#8217;s acquisition by third party investors. The first docket is captioned &#8220;In re: Investigation of double leveraging issues for all LPSC-jurisdictional utilities,&#8221; and the second is captioned &#8220;In re: Investigation of tax structure issues for all LPSC-jurisdictional utilities.&#8221; In April 2016 the LPSC clarified that the concerns giving rise to the two dockets arose as a result of its review of the structure of the Cleco-Macquarie transaction and that the specific intent of the directives is to seek more information regarding intra-corporate debt financing of a utility&#8217;s capital structure as well as the use of investment tax credits to mitigate the tax obligation at the parent level of a consolidated entity. No schedule has been set for either docket, and limited discovery has occurred. 
In December 2019 an LPSC commissioner issued an unopposed directive to staff to research customer-centered options for all customer classes, as well as other regulatory environments, and recommend a plan for how to ensure customers are the focus. There was no opposition to the directive from other commissioners but several remarked that the intent of the directive was not initiated to pursue retail open access. In furtherance of the directive, the LPSC issued a notice of the opening of a docket to conduct a rulemaking to research and evaluate customer-centered options for all electric customer classes as well as other regulatory environments in January 2020. 
Entergy Mississippi 
Fuel Recovery 
Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s rate schedules include energy cost recovery riders to recover fuel and purchased power costs. The energy cost rate for each calendar year is redetermined annually and includes a true-up adjustment reflecting the over-recovery or under-recovery of the energy costs as of the 12-month period ended September 30. Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s fuel cost recoveries are subject to annual audits conducted pursuant to the authority of the MPSC. 
To help stabilize electricity costs, Entergy Mississippi received approval from the MPSC to hedge its exposure to natural gas price volatility through the use of financial instruments. Entergy Mississippi hedges approximately one-third of the projected exposure to natural gas price changes for the gas used to serve its native electric load for all months of the year. The hedge quantity is reviewed on an annual basis.

Formula Rate Plan 
In August 2012 the MPSC opened inquiries to review whether the current formulaic methodology used to calculate the return on common equity in both Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s formula rate plan and Mississippi Power Company&#8217;s annual formula rate plan was still appropriate or could be improved to better serve the public interest. The intent of this inquiry and review was for informational purposes only; the evaluation of any recommendations for changes to the existing methodology would take place in a general rate case or in the existing formula rate plan proceeding. In March 2013 the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff filed its consultant&#8217;s report which noted the return on common equity estimation methods used by Entergy Mississippi and Mississippi Power Company are commonly used throughout the electric utility industry. The report suggested ways in which the methods used by Entergy Mississippi and Mississippi Power Company might be improved, but did not recommend specific changes in the return on common equity formulas or calculations at that time. In June 2014 the MPSC expanded the scope of the August 2012 inquiry to study the merits of adopting a uniform formula rate plan that could be applied, where possible in whole or in part, to both Entergy Mississippi and Mississippi Power Company in order to achieve greater consistency in the plans. The MPSC directed the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff to investigate and review Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s formula rate plan rider schedule and Mississippi Power Company&#8217;s Performance Evaluation Plan by considering the merits and deficiencies and possibilities for improvement of each and then to propose a uniform formula rate plan that, where possible, could be applicable to both companies. No procedural schedule has been set. In October 2014 the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff conducted a public technical conference to discuss performance benchmarking and its potential application to the electric utilities&#8217; formula rate plans. The docket remains open. 
Entergy New Orleans 
Fuel Recovery 
Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s electric rate schedules include a fuel adjustment tariff designed to reflect no more than targeted fuel and purchased power costs, adjusted by a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel and purchased power costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges. 
Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s gas rate schedules include a purchased gas adjustment to reflect estimated gas costs for the billing month, adjusted by a surcharge or credit similar to that included in the electric fuel adjustment clause, including carrying charges. 
To help stabilize gas costs, Entergy New Orleans seeks approval annually from the City Council to continue implementation of its natural gas hedging program consistent with the City Council&#8217;s stated policy objectives. The program uses financial instruments to hedge exposure to volatility in the wholesale price of natural gas purchased to serve Entergy New Orleans gas customers. Entergy New Orleans hedges up to 25% of actual gas sales made during the winter months.

Energy Efficiency Programs 
A 2008 rate case settlement included $3.1 million per year in electric rates to fund the Energy Smart energy efficiency programs. The rate settlement provided an incentive for Entergy New Orleans to meet or exceed energy savings targets set by the City Council and provided a mechanism for Entergy New Orleans to recover lost contribution to fixed costs associated with the energy savings generated from the energy efficiency programs. In January 2015 the City Council approved funding for the Energy Smart program from April 2015 through March 2017 using the remainder of the approximately $12.8 million of 2014 rough production cost equalization funds, with any remaining costs being recovered through the fuel adjustment clause. This funding methodology was modified in November 2015 when the City Council directed Entergy New Orleans to use a combination of guaranteed customer savings related to a prior agreement with the City Council and rough production cost equalization funds to cover program costs prior to recovering any costs through the fuel adjustment clause. In April 2017 the City Council approved an implementation plan for the Energy Smart program from April 2017 through December 2019. The City Council directed that the $11.8 million balance reported for Energy Smart funds be used to continue funding the program for Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s legacy customers and that the Energy Smart Algiers program continue to be funded through the Algiers fuel adjustment clause, until additional customer funding is required for the legacy customers. In September 2017, Entergy New Orleans filed a supplemental plan and proposed several options for an interim cost recovery mechanism necessary to recover program costs during the period between when existing funds directed to Energy Smart programs are depleted and when new rates from the 2018 combined rate case, which includes a cost recovery mechanism for Energy Smart funding, take effect. In December 2017 the City Council approved an energy efficiency cost recovery rider as an interim funding mechanism for Energy Smart, subject to verification that no additional funding sources exist. In June 2018 the City Council also approved a resolution recommending that Entergy New Orleans allocate approximately $13.5 million of benefits resulting from the Tax Act to Energy Smart. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s application with the City Council seeking approval of an implementation plan for the Energy Smart program from April 2020 through December 2022. 
Entergy Texas 
Fuel Recovery 
Entergy Texas&#8217;s rate schedules include a fixed fuel factor to recover fuel and purchased power costs, including interest, that are not included in base rates. Semi-annual revisions of the fixed fuel factor are made in March and September based on the market price of natural gas and changes in fuel mix. The amounts collected under Entergy Texas&#8217;s fixed fuel factor and any interim surcharge or refund are subject to fuel reconciliation proceedings before the PUCT. The PUCT fuel cost proceedings are discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements. 
At the PUCT&#8217;s April 2013 open meeting, the PUCT Commissioners discussed their view that a purchased power capacity rider was good public policy. The PUCT issued an order in May 2013 adopting the rule allowing for a purchased power capacity rider, subject to an offsetting adjustment for load growth. The rule, as adopted, also includes a process for obtaining pre-approval by the PUCT of purchased power agreements. Entergy Texas has not exercised the option to recover its capacity costs under the new rider mechanism, but will continue to evaluate the benefits of utilizing the new rider to recover future capacity costs. 
Electric Industry Restructuring 
In June 2009, a law was enacted in Texas that required Entergy Texas to cease all activities relating to Entergy Texas&#8217;s transition to competition. The law allows Entergy Texas to remain a part of the SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC) Region, although it does not prevent Entergy Texas from joining another power region. The law provides that proceedings to certify a power region that Entergy Texas belongs to as a qualified power region can be initiated by the PUCT, or on motion by another party, when the conditions supporting such a proceeding 
Part I Item 1 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
exist. Under the law, the PUCT may not approve a transition to competition plan for Entergy Texas until the expiration of four years from the PUCT&#8217;s certification of Entergy Texas&#8217;s power region. 
The law also contains provisions that allow Entergy Texas to take advantage of a cost recovery mechanism that permits annual filings for the recovery of reasonable and necessary expenditures for transmission infrastructure improvement and changes in wholesale transmission charges. This mechanism was previously available to other non-ERCOT Texas utility companies, but not to Entergy Texas. 
The law further amended already existing law that had required Entergy Texas to propose for PUCT approval a tariff to allow eligible customers the ability to contract for competitive generation. The amending language in the law provides, among other things, that: 1) the tariff shall not be implemented in a manner that harms the sustainability or competitiveness of manufacturers who choose not to participate in the tariff; 2) Entergy Texas shall &#8220;purchase competitive generation service, selected by the customer, and provide the generation at retail to the customer;&#8221; and 3) Entergy Texas shall provide and price transmission service and ancillary services under that tariff at a rate that is unbundled from its cost of service. The law directs that the PUCT may not issue an order on the tariff that is contrary to an applicable decision, rule, or policy statement of a federal regulatory agency having jurisdiction. 
The PUCT determined that unrecovered costs that may be recovered through the rider consist only of those costs necessary to implement and administer the competitive generation program and do not include lost revenues or embedded generation costs. The amount of customer load that may be included in the competitive generation service program is limited to 115 MW. 
In September 2011 the PUCT adopted a proposed rule implementing a distribution cost recovery factor to recover capital and capital-related costs related to distribution infrastructure. The distribution cost recovery factor permits utilities once per year to implement an increase or decrease in rates above or below amounts reflected in base rates to reflect depreciation expense, federal income tax and other taxes, and return on investment. The distribution cost recovery factor rider may be changed a maximum of four times between base rate cases. 
In September 2019 the PUCT initiated a rulemaking to promulgate a generation cost recovery factor rule, implementing legislation passed in the 2019 Texas legislative session intended to allow electric utilities to recover generation investments between base rate proceedings. The PUCT approved the final rule in July 2020. 
Franchises 
Entergy Arkansas holds exclusive franchises to provide electric service in approximately 308 incorporated cities and towns in Arkansas. These franchises are unlimited in duration and continue unless the municipalities purchase the utility property. In Arkansas franchises are considered to be contracts and, therefore, are terminable pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreement and applicable statutes. 
Entergy Louisiana holds non-exclusive franchises to provide electric service in approximately 175 incorporated municipalities and in the unincorporated areas of approximately 59 parishes of Louisiana. Entergy Louisiana holds non-exclusive franchises to provide natural gas service to customers in the City of Baton Rouge and in East Baton Rouge Parish. Municipal franchise agreement terms range from 25 to 60 years while parish franchise terms range from 25 to 99 years. 
Entergy Mississippi has received from the MPSC certificates of public convenience and necessity to provide electric service to areas within 45 counties, including a number of municipalities, in western Mississippi. Under Mississippi statutory law, such certificates are exclusive. Entergy Mississippi may continue to serve in such municipalities upon payment of a statutory franchise fee, regardless of whether an original municipal franchise is still in existence. 
Part I Item 1 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Entergy New Orleans provides electric and gas service in the City of New Orleans pursuant to indeterminate permits set forth in city ordinances. These ordinances contain a continuing option for the City of New Orleans to purchase Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s electric and gas utility properties. 
Entergy Texas holds a certificate of convenience and necessity from the PUCT to provide electric service to areas within approximately 27 counties in eastern Texas, and holds non-exclusive franchises to provide electric service in approximately 68 incorporated municipalities. Entergy Texas typically obtains 25-year franchise agreements as existing agreements expire. Entergy Texas&#8217;s electric franchises expire over the period 2020-2058. 
The business of System Energy is limited to wholesale power sales. It has no distribution franchises. 
Property and Other Generation Resources 
Owned Generating Stations 
The total capability of the generating stations owned and leased by the Utility operating companies and System Energy as of December 31, 2020, is indicated below: 
(a) &#8220;Owned and Leased Capability&#8221; is the dependable load carrying capability as demonstrated under actual operating conditions based on the primary fuel (assuming no curtailments) that each station was designed to utilize. 
Summer peak load for the Utility has averaged 21,591 MW over the previous decade. 
The Utility operating companies&#8217; load and capacity projections are reviewed periodically to assess the need and timing for additional generating capacity and interconnections. These reviews consider existing and projected demand, the availability and price of power, the location of new load, the economy, Entergy&#8217;s clean energy and other public policy goals, environmental regulations, and the age and condition of Entergy&#8217;s existing infrastructure. 
The Utility operating companies&#8217; long-term resource strategy (Portfolio Transformation Strategy) calls for the bulk of capacity needs to be met through long-term resources, whether owned or contracted. Over the past decade, the Portfolio Transformation Strategy has resulted in the addition of about 8,801 MW of new long-term resources and the deactivation of about 4,664 MW of legacy generation. As MISO market participants, the Utility operating companies also participate in MISO&#8217;s Day Ahead and Real Time Energy and Ancillary Services markets to economically dispatch generation and purchase energy to serve customers reliably and at the lowest reasonable cost.

RFP Procurements 
The Utility operating companies from time to time issue requests for proposals (RFP) to procure supply-side resources from sources other than the spot market to meet the unique regional needs of the Utility operating companies. The RFPs issued by the Utility operating companies have sought resources needed to meet near-term MISO reliability requirements as well as long-term requirements through a broad range of wholesale power products, including limited-term (1 to 3 years) and long-term contractual products and asset acquisitions. The RFP process has resulted in selections or acquisitions, including, among other things:

Part I Item 1 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
In April 2020, Entergy Services, on behalf of Entergy Texas, issued an RFP for combined-cycle gas turbine capacity and energy resources. The RFP was seeking up to 1,000 MW - 1,200 MW of capacity, capacity-related benefits, energy, other electric products, and environmental attributes, if any, from a single generation resource located in the &#8220;Eastern Region&#8221; of Entergy Texas&#8217;s service area. In December 2020, Entergy Texas posted notice that it has elected to proceed with the self-build alternative, Orange County Power Station. The self-build alternative will be conditioned on receipt of required internal and regulatory approvals. 
In June 2020, Entergy Services, on behalf of Entergy Louisiana, issued an RFP for solar photovoltaic resources. The RFP was seeking 300 MW of energy, capacity, capacity-related benefits, other electric products, and environmental attributes from eligible new-build solar photovoltaic generation resources. In December 2020, Entergy Louisiana concluded evaluations of the RFP. Three proposals have been placed on the primary selection list and two proposals have been placed on the secondary selection list. Negotiations are currently in progress. 
In January 2021, Entergy Texas provided notice that it intends to issue an RFP for solar generation resources. The RFP is seeking a minimum of 200 MW through a combination of build-own-transfer agreements, self-build alternatives, and power purchase agreements that can provide cost-effective energy supply, fuel diversity, and other benefits to Entergy Texas customers. 
Other Procurements From Third Parties 
The Utility operating companies have also made resource acquisitions outside of the RFP process, including Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s January 2006 acquisition of the 480 MW, combined-cycle, gas-fired Attala power plant; Entergy Gulf States Louisiana&#8217;s March 2008 acquisition of the 322 MW, simple-cycle, gas-fired Calcasieu Generating Facility; Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s April 2011 acquisition of the 580 MW, combined-cycle, gas-fired Acadia Energy Center Unit 2; Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s (Power Block 2), Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s (Power Blocks 3 and 4), and Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s (Power Block 1) March 2016 acquisitions of the 1,980 MW (summer rating), natural gas-fired, combined-cycle gas turbine Union Power Station power blocks, each rated at 495 MW (summer rating); and Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s October 2019 acquisition of the 810 MW, combined-cycle, natural gas-fired Choctaw Generating Station. The Utility operating companies have also entered into various limited- and long-term contracts in recent years as a result of bilateral negotiations. 
The Washington Parish Energy Center is a 361 MW natural gas-fired peaking power plant approximately 60 miles north of New Orleans on a site Entergy Louisiana purchased from Calpine in 2019. In May 2018, Entergy Louisiana received LPSC approval of its certification application for this simple-cycle power plant to be developed pursuant to an agreement between Calpine and Entergy Louisiana. Calpine began construction on the plant in early 2019 and Entergy Louisiana purchased the plant upon completion in November 2020. 
The Hardin County Peaking Facility is an existing 147 MW simple-cycle gas-fired peaking power plant in Kountze, Texas, owned by East Texas Electric Cooperative. Entergy Texas is currently seeking regulatory certification to move forward with the purchase of the facility. The facility has been in operation since January 2010.

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Power Through Program 
In December 2020, Entergy Texas filed an application with the PUCT to amend its certificate of convenience and necessity to own and operate up to 75 MW of natural gas-fired distributed generation that is to be installed at commercial and industrial customer premises. If approved, Entergy Texas would own and operate a fleet of generators ranging from 100 kW to 10 MW that would supply a portion of Entergy Texas&#8217;s long-term resource needs and enhance the resiliency of Entergy Texas&#8217;s electric grid. This fleet of generators would also be available to customers during outages to supply backup electric service as part of a program known as &#8220;Power Through.&#8221; 
Interconnections 
The Utility operating companies&#8217; generating units are interconnected to a transmission system operating at various voltages up to 500 kV. These generating units consist of steam-electric production facilities, combustion-turbine generators, pressurized and boiling water nuclear reactors, and inverter-based technologies operating in the MISO energy and ancillary services market. Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies are MISO market participants and are interconnected with many neighboring utilities. MISO is an essential link in the safe, cost-effective delivery of electric power across all or parts of 15 U.S. states and the Canadian province of Manitoba. As a Regional Transmission Organization, MISO assures consumers of unbiased regional grid management and open access to the transmission facilities under MISO&#8217;s functional supervision. In addition, the Utility operating companies are members of SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC). SERC is a nonprofit corporation responsible for promoting and improving the reliability, adequacy, and critical infrastructure of the bulk power supply systems in all or portions of 16 central and southeastern states. SERC serves as a regional entity with delegated authority from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) for the purpose of proposing and enforcing Bulk Electric System reliability standards within the SERC Region. 
Gas Property 
As of December 31, 2020, Entergy New Orleans distributed and transported natural gas for distribution within New Orleans, Louisiana, through approximately 2,600 miles of gas pipeline. As of December 31, 2020, the gas properties of Entergy Louisiana, which are located in and around Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were not material to Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s financial position. 
Title 
The Utility operating companies&#8217; generating stations are generally located on properties owned in fee simple. Most of the substations and transmission and distribution lines are constructed on private property or public rights-of-way pursuant to easements, servitudes, or appropriate franchises. Some substation properties are owned in fee simple. The Utility operating companies generally have the right of eminent domain, whereby they may perfect title to, or secure easements or servitudes on, private property for their utility operations. 
Substantially all of the physical properties and assets owned by Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy are subject to the liens of mortgages securing bonds issued by those companies. The Lewis Creek generating station of Entergy Texas was acquired by merger with a subsidiary of Entergy Texas and is currently not subject to the lien of the Entergy Texas indenture. 
Part I Item 1 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Fuel Supply 
The sources of generation and average fuel cost per kWh for the Utility operating companies and System Energy for the years 2018-2020 were: 
Actual 2020 and projected 2021 sources of generation for the Utility operating companies and System Energy, including certain power purchases from affiliates under life of unit power purchase agreements, including the Unit Power Sales Agreement, are: 
(a) Hydroelectric power provided less than 1% of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s generation in 2020 and is expected to provide less than 1% of its generation in 2021. 
(b) Solar power provided less than 1% of Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s and Entergy New Orleans's generation in 2020 and is expected to provide less than 1% of each of Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s and Entergy New Orleans's generation in 2021. 
(c) Capacity and energy from System Energy&#8217;s interest in Grand Gulf is allocated as follows under the Unit Power Sales Agreement: Entergy Arkansas - 36%; Entergy Louisiana - 14%; Entergy Mississippi - 33%; and Entergy New Orleans - 17%. Pursuant to purchased power agreements, Entergy Arkansas is selling a portion of its owned capacity and energy from Grand Gulf to Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans. 
(d) Excludes MISO purchases. 
(e) In December 2013, Entergy integrated its transmission system into the MISO RTO. Entergy offers all of its generation into the MISO energy market on a day-ahead and real-time basis and bids for power in the MISO energy market to serve the demand of its customers, with MISO making dispatch decisions. The MISO purchases metric provided for 2020 is not projected for 2021. 
Some of the Utility&#8217;s gas-fired plants are also capable of using fuel oil, if necessary. Although based on current economics the Utility does not expect fuel oil use in 2021, it is possible that various operational events including weather or pipeline maintenance may require the use of fuel oil. 
Natural Gas 
The Utility operating companies have long-term firm and short-term interruptible gas contracts for both supply and transportation. Over 50% of the Utility operating companies&#8217; power plants maintain some level of long- 
Part I Item 1 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
term firm transportation. Short-term contracts and spot-market purchases satisfy additional gas requirements. Entergy Texas owns a gas storage facility that provides reliable and flexible natural gas service to certain generating stations. 
Many factors, including wellhead deliverability, storage, pipeline capacity, and demand requirements of end users, influence the availability and price of natural gas supplies for power plants. Demand is primarily tied to weather conditions as well as to the prices and availability of other energy sources. Pursuant to federal and state regulations, gas supplies to power plants may be interrupted during periods of shortage. To the extent natural gas supplies are disrupted or natural gas prices significantly increase, the Utility operating companies may in some instances use alternate fuels, such as oil when available, or rely to a larger extent on coal, nuclear generation, and purchased power. 
Coal 
Entergy Arkansas has committed to seven one- to three-year contracts that will supply approximately 85% of the total coal supply needs in 2021. These contracts are staggered in term so that not all contracts have to be renewed the same year. The remaining 15% of total coal requirements will be satisfied by contracts with a term of less than one year. Based on continued improved Powder River Basin (PRB) coal deliveries by rail and the high cost of alternate sources and modes of transportation, no alternative coal consumption is expected at Entergy Arkansas during 2021. Coal will be transported to Arkansas via an existing transportation agreement that is expected to provide all of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s rail transportation requirements for 2021. 
Entergy Louisiana has committed to five one- to three-year contracts that will supply approximately 90% of Nelson Unit 6 coal needs in 2021. If needed, additional PRB coal will be purchased through contracts with a term of less than one year to provide the remaining supply needs. For the same reasons as for Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s plants, no alternative coal consumption is expected at Nelson Unit 6 during 2021. Coal will be transported to Nelson primarily via an existing transportation agreement that is expected to provide all of Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s rail transportation requirements for 2021. 
For the year 2020, coal transportation delivery rates to Entergy Arkansas-and Entergy Louisiana-operated coal-fired units were adequate to meet supply needs and obligations, and it is expected that delivery times in 2021 will continue to be consistent. Both Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana control a sufficient number of railcars to satisfy the rail transportation requirement. 
The operator of Big Cajun 2 - Unit 3, Louisiana Generating, LLC, has advised Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Texas that it has adequate rail car and barge capacity to meet the volumes of PRB coal requested for 2021. Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s and Entergy Texas&#8217;s coal nomination requests to Big Cajun 2 - Unit 3 are made on an annual basis. 
Nuclear Fuel 
The nuclear fuel cycle consists of the following: 
The Registrant Subsidiaries that own nuclear plants, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, are responsible through a shared regulated uranium pool for contracts to acquire nuclear material to be used in fueling Entergy&#8217;s Utility nuclear units. These companies own the materials and services in this shared regulated 
Part I Item 1 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
uranium pool on a pro rata fractional basis determined by the nuclear generation capability of each company. Any liabilities for obligations of the pooled contracts are on a several but not joint basis. The shared regulated uranium pool maintains inventories of nuclear materials during the various stages of processing. The Registrant Subsidiaries purchase enriched uranium hexafluoride for their nuclear plant reload requirements at the average inventory cost from the shared regulated uranium pool. Entergy Operations, Inc. contracts separately for the fabrication of nuclear fuel as agent on behalf of each of the Registrant Subsidiaries that owns a nuclear plant. All contracts for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel are between the DOE and the owner of a nuclear power plant. 
Based upon currently planned fuel cycles, the Utility nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what Entergy believes are reasonably predictable or fixed prices through most of 2023. Entergy&#8217;s ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners. There are a number of possible supply alternatives that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, including potentially drawing upon Entergy&#8217;s inventory intended for later generation periods depending upon its risk management strategy at that time, although the pricing of any alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time. In addition, some nuclear fuel contracts are on a non-fixed price basis subject to prevailing prices at the time of delivery. 
The effects of market price changes may be reduced and deferred by risk management strategies, such as negotiation of floor and ceiling amounts for long-term contracts, buying for inventory or entering into forward physical contracts at fixed prices when Entergy believes it is appropriate and useful. Entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S. 
Entergy&#8217;s ability to assure nuclear fuel supply also depends upon the performance reliability of conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services providers. There are fewer of these providers than for uranium. For conversion and enrichment services, like uranium, Entergy diversifies its supply by supplier and country and may take special measures as needed to ensure supply of enriched uranium for the reliable fabrication of nuclear fuel. For fabrication services, each plant is dependent upon the effective performance of the fabricator of that plant&#8217;s nuclear fuel, therefore, Entergy provides additional monitoring, inspection, and oversight for the fabrication process to assure reliability and quality. 
Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy each have made arrangements to lease nuclear fuel and related equipment and services. The lessors, which are consolidated in the financial statements of Entergy and the applicable Registrant Subsidiary, finance the acquisition and ownership of nuclear fuel through credit agreements and the issuance of notes. These credit facilities are subject to periodic renewal, and the notes are issued periodically, typically for terms between three and seven years. 
Natural Gas Purchased for Resale 
Entergy New Orleans has several suppliers of natural gas. Its system is interconnected with one interstate and three intrastate pipelines. Entergy New Orleans has a &#8220;no-notice&#8221; service gas purchase contract with CenterPoint Energy Services which guarantees Entergy New Orleans gas delivery at specific delivery points and at any volume within the minimum and maximum set forth in the contract amounts. The CenterPoint Energy Service gas supply is transported to Entergy New Orleans pursuant to a transportation service agreement with Gulf South Pipeline Co. This service is subject to FERC-approved rates. Entergy New Orleans also makes interruptible spot market purchases. 
Entergy Louisiana purchased natural gas for resale in 2020 under a firm contract from Sequent Energy Management L.P. The gas is delivered through a combination of intrastate and interstate pipelines. 
Part I Item 1 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
As a result of the implementation of FERC-mandated interstate pipeline restructuring in 1993, curtailments of interstate gas supply could occur if Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s or Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s suppliers failed to perform their obligations to deliver gas under their supply agreements. Gulf South Pipeline Co. could curtail transportation capacity only in the event of pipeline system constraints. 
Federal Regulation of the Utility 
State or local regulatory authorities, as described above, regulate the retail rates of the Utility operating companies. The FERC regulates wholesale sales of electricity rates and interstate transmission of electricity, including System Energy&#8217;s sales of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of federal regulation proceedings. 
System Agreement (Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 
Prior to each operating company&#8217;s termination of participation in the System Agreement (Entergy Arkansas in December 2013, Entergy Mississippi in November 2015, and Entergy Louisiana, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas each in August 2016), the Utility operating companies engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which was a rate schedule approved by the FERC. Under the terms of the System Agreement, generating capacity and other power resources were jointly operated by the Utility operating companies that were participating in the System Agreement. The System Agreement provided, among other things, that parties having generating reserves greater than their allocated share of reserves (long companies) would receive payments from those parties having generating reserves that were less than their allocated share of reserves (short companies). Such payments were at amounts sufficient to cover certain of the long companies&#8217; costs for intermediate and peaking oil/gas-fired generation, including operating expenses, fixed charges on debt, dividend requirements on preferred equity, and a fair rate of return on common equity investment. Under the System Agreement, the rates used to compensate long companies were based on costs associated with the long companies&#8217; steam electric generating units fueled by oil or gas and having an annual average heat rate above 10,000 Btu/kWh. In addition, for all energy exchanged among the Utility operating companies under the System Agreement, the companies purchasing exchange energy were required to pay the cost of fuel consumed in generating such energy plus a charge to cover other associated costs. 
Although the System Agreement has terminated, certain of the Utility operating companies&#8217; and their retail regulators are pursuing litigation involving the System Agreement at the FERC and in federal courts. The proceedings include challenges to the allocation of costs as defined by the System Agreement and other matters. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of legal proceedings at the FERC and in federal courts involving the System Agreement. 
Transmission and MISO Markets 
In December 2013 the Utility operating companies integrated into the MISO RTO. Although becoming a member of MISO did not affect the ownership by the Utility operating companies of their transmission facilities or the responsibility for maintaining those facilities, MISO maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and administers wholesale energy and ancillary services markets for market participants in the MISO region, including the Utility operating companies. MISO also exercises functional control of transmission planning and congestion management and provides schedules and pricing for the commitment and dispatch of generation that is offered into MISO&#8217;s markets, as well as pricing for load that bids into the markets. The Utility operating companies sell capacity, energy, and ancillary services on a bilateral basis to certain wholesale customers and offer available electricity production of their generating facilities into the MISO day-ahead and real-time energy markets pursuant to the MISO tariff and market rules. Each Utility operating company has its own transmission pricing zone and a formula rate template (included as Attachment O to the MISO tariff) used to 
Part I Item 1 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
establish transmission rates within MISO. The terms and conditions of the MISO tariff, including provisions related to the design and implementation of wholesale markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs, are subject to regulation by the FERC. 
System Energy and Related Agreements 
System Energy recovers costs related to its interest in Grand Gulf through rates charged to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans for capacity and energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement (described below). In July 2001 a rate proceeding commenced by System Energy at the FERC in 1995 became final, with the FERC approving a prospective 10.94% return on equity. In 1998 the FERC approved requests by Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi to accelerate a portion of their Grand Gulf purchased power obligations. Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s and Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s acceleration of Grand Gulf purchased power obligations ceased effective July 2001 and July 2003, respectively, as approved by the FERC. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of complaints filed with the FERC regarding System Energy&#8217;s return on equity. 
Unit Power Sales Agreement 
The Unit Power Sales Agreement allocates capacity, energy, and the related costs from System Energy&#8217;s ownership and leasehold interests in Grand Gulf to Entergy Arkansas (36%), Entergy Louisiana (14%), Entergy Mississippi (33%), and Entergy New Orleans (17%). Each of these companies is obligated to make payments to System Energy for its entitlement of capacity and energy on a full cost-of-service basis regardless of the quantity of energy delivered. Payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are System Energy&#8217;s only source of operating revenue. The financial condition of System Energy depends upon the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf and the receipt of such payments. Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans generally recover payments made under the Unit Power Sales Agreement through rates charged to their customers. 
In the case of Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Louisiana, payments are also recovered through sales of electricity from their respective retained shares of Grand Gulf. Under a settlement agreement entered into with the APSC in 1985 and amended in 1988, Entergy Arkansas retains 22% of its 36% share of Grand Gulf-related costs and recovers the remaining 78% of its share in rates. In the event that Entergy Arkansas is not able to sell its retained share to third parties, it may sell such energy to its retail customers at a price equal to its avoided cost, which is currently less than Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s cost from its retained share. Entergy Arkansas has life-of-resources purchased power agreements with Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans that sell a portion of the output of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s retained share of Grand Gulf to those companies, with the remainder of the retained share being sold to Entergy Mississippi through a separate life-of-resources purchased power agreement. In a series of LPSC orders, court decisions, and agreements from late 1985 to mid-1988, Entergy Louisiana was granted rate relief with respect to costs associated with Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s share of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf, subject to certain terms and conditions. Entergy Louisiana retains and does not recover from retail ratepayers 18% of its 14% share of the costs of Grand Gulf capacity and energy and recovers the remaining 82% of its share in rates. Entergy Louisiana is allowed to recover through the fuel adjustment clause at 4.6 cents per kWh for the energy related to its retained portion of these costs. Alternatively, Entergy Louisiana may sell such energy to non-affiliated parties at prices above the fuel adjustment clause recovery amount, subject to the LPSC&#8217;s approval. Entergy Arkansas also has a life-of-resources purchased power agreement with Entergy Mississippi to sell a portion of the output of Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s non-retained share of Grand Gulf. Entergy Mississippi was granted rate relief for those purchases by the MPSC through its annual unit power cost rate mechanism. 
Availability Agreement 
The Availability Agreement among System Energy and Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans was entered into in 1974 in connection with the financing by System Energy 
Part I Item 1 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
of Grand Gulf. The Availability Agreement provides that System Energy make available to Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans all capacity and energy available from System Energy&#8217;s share of Grand Gulf. 
Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans also agreed severally to pay System Energy monthly for the right to receive capacity and energy from Grand Gulf in amounts that (when added to any amounts received by System Energy under the Unit Power Sales Agreement) would at least equal System Energy&#8217;s total operating expenses for Grand Gulf (including depreciation at a specified rate and expenses incurred in a permanent shutdown of Grand Gulf) and interest charges. 
The allocation percentages under the Availability Agreement are fixed as follows: Entergy Arkansas - 17.1%; Entergy Louisiana - 26.9%; Entergy Mississippi - 31.3%; and Entergy New Orleans - 24.7%. The allocation percentages under the Availability Agreement would remain in effect and would govern payments made under such agreement in the event of a shortfall of funds available to System Energy from other sources, including payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. 
System Energy has assigned its rights to payments and advances from Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans under the Availability Agreement as security for its two outstanding series of first mortgage bonds. In these assignments, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans further agreed that, in the event they were prohibited by governmental action from making payments under the Availability Agreement (for example, if the FERC reduced or disallowed such payments as constituting excessive rates), they would then make subordinated advances to System Energy in the same amounts and at the same times as the prohibited payments. System Energy would not be allowed to repay these subordinated advances so long as it remained in default under the related indebtedness or in other similar circumstances. 
Each of the assignment agreements relating to the Availability Agreement provides that Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans will make payments directly to System Energy. However, if there is an event of default, those payments must be made directly to the holders of indebtedness that are the beneficiaries of such assignment agreements. The payments must be made pro rata according to the amount of the respective obligations secured. 
The obligations of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans to make payments under the Availability Agreement are subject to the receipt and continued effectiveness of all necessary regulatory approvals. Sales of capacity and energy under the Availability Agreement would require that the Availability Agreement be submitted to the FERC for approval with respect to the terms of such sale. No such filing with the FERC has been made because sales of capacity and energy from Grand Gulf are being made pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. If, for any reason, sales of capacity and energy are made in the future pursuant to the Availability Agreement, the jurisdictional portions of the Availability Agreement would be submitted to the FERC for approval. 
Since commercial operation of Grand Gulf began, payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement to System Energy have exceeded the amounts payable under the Availability Agreement and, therefore, no payments under the Availability Agreement have ever been required. If Entergy Arkansas or Entergy Mississippi fails to make its Unit Power Sales Agreement payments, and System Energy is unable to obtain funds from other sources, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans could become subject to claims or demands by System Energy or its creditors for payments or advances under the Availability Agreement (or the assignments thereof) equal to the difference between their required Unit Power Sales Agreement payments and their required Availability Agreement payments because their Availability Agreement obligations exceed their Unit Power Sales Agreement obligations. 
The Availability Agreement may be terminated, amended, or modified by mutual agreement of the parties thereto, without further consent of any assignees or other creditors.

Service Companies 
Entergy Services, a limited liability company wholly-owned by Entergy Corporation, provides management, administrative, accounting, legal, engineering, and other services primarily to the Utility operating companies, but also provides services to Entergy Wholesale Commodities. Entergy Operations is also wholly-owned by Entergy Corporation and provides nuclear management, operations and maintenance services under contract for ANO, River Bend, Waterford 3, and Grand Gulf, subject to the owner oversight of Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, respectively. Entergy Services and Entergy Operations provide their services to the Utility operating companies and System Energy on an &#8220;at cost&#8221; basis, pursuant to cost allocation methodologies for these service agreements that were approved by the FERC. 
Jurisdictional Separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas 
Effective December 31, 2007, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. completed a jurisdictional separation into two vertically integrated utility companies, one operating under the sole retail jurisdiction of the PUCT, Entergy Texas, and the other operating under the sole retail jurisdiction of the LPSC, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. Entergy Texas owns all Entergy Gulf States, Inc. distribution and transmission assets located in Texas, the gas-fired generating plants located in Texas, undivided 42.5% ownership shares of Entergy Gulf States, Inc.&#8217;s 70% ownership interest in Nelson Unit 6 and 42% ownership interest in Big Cajun 2, Unit 3, which are coal-fired generating plants located in Louisiana, and other assets and contract rights to the extent related to utility operations in Texas. Entergy Louisiana, as successor in interest to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, owns all of the remaining assets that were owned by Entergy Gulf States, Inc. On a book value basis, approximately 58.1% of the Entergy Gulf States, Inc. assets were allocated to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and approximately 41.9% were allocated to Entergy Texas. 
Entergy Texas purchases from Entergy Louisiana pursuant to a life-of-unit purchased power agreement a 42.5% share of capacity and energy from the 70% of River Bend subject to retail regulation. Entergy Texas was allocated a share of River Bend&#8217;s nuclear and environmental liabilities that is identical to the share of the plant&#8217;s output purchased by Entergy Texas under the purchased power agreement. In connection with the termination of the System Agreement effective August 31, 2016, the purchased power agreements that were put in place for certain legacy units at the time of the jurisdictional separation were also terminated at that time. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the purchased power agreements. 
Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana Business Combination 
On October 1, 2015, the businesses formerly conducted by Entergy Louisiana (Old Entergy Louisiana) and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana (Old Entergy Gulf States Louisiana) were combined into a single public utility. In order to effect the business combination, under the Texas Business Organizations Code (TXBOC), Old Entergy Louisiana allocated substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary, Entergy Louisiana Power, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (New Entergy Louisiana), and New Entergy Louisiana assumed the liabilities of Old Entergy Louisiana, in a transaction regarded as a merger under the TXBOC. Under the TXBOC, Old Entergy Gulf States Louisiana allocated substantially all of its assets to a new subsidiary (New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana) and New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana assumed the liabilities of Old Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, in a transaction regarded as a merger under the TXBOC. New Entergy Gulf States Louisiana then merged into New Entergy Louisiana with New Entergy Louisiana surviving the merger. Thereupon, Old Entergy Louisiana changed its name from &#8220;Entergy Louisiana, LLC&#8221; to &#8220;EL Investment Company, LLC&#8221; and New Entergy Louisiana changed its name from &#8220;Entergy Louisiana Power, LLC&#8221; to &#8220;Entergy Louisiana, LLC&#8221; (Entergy Louisiana). With the completion of the business combination, Entergy Louisiana holds substantially all of the assets, and has assumed the liabilities, of Old Entergy Louisiana and Old Entergy Gulf States Louisiana.

The restructuring was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control. 
Entergy Wholesale Commodities 
Entergy Wholesale Commodities includes the ownership, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear power plants, located in the northern United States and the sale of the electric power produced by its operating plants to wholesale customers. Entergy Wholesale Commodities revenues are primarily derived from sales of energy and generation capacity from these plants. Entergy Wholesale Commodities also provides operations and management services, including decommissioning-related services, to nuclear power plants owned by non-affiliated entities in the United States. Entergy Wholesale Commodities also includes the ownership of interests in non-nuclear power plants that sell the electric power produced by those plants to wholesale customers. 
See &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power Business &#8221; in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion of the operation and planned shutdown and sale of each of the remaining Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants. 
Property 
Nuclear Generating Stations 
Entergy Wholesale Commodities includes the ownership of the following nuclear power plants: 
(a) Power operations ceased at the Indian Point 2 plant in April 2020. The fuel was permanently removed from the reactor vessel and placed in the spent fuel pool in May 2020. The Indian Point 3 plant is expected to cease operations on April 30, 2021. Entergy and Holtec jointly filed a license transfer application with the NRC in November 2019, requesting approval for the transfer of the Indian Point plants, along with their nuclear decommissioning trusts and decommissioning liabilities, from Entergy to Holtec. The NRC approved the license transfer application on November 23, 2020. 
Part I Item 1 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
(b) The Palisades plant is expected to cease operations on May 31, 2022. There is a contract to sell the plant to Holtec subject to NRC and other regulatory approvals. 
See &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power Business &#8221; in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for further discussion of the operation and planned shutdown and sale of each of the remaining Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants. 
Entergy Wholesale Commodities also includes the ownership of two non-operating nuclear facilities, Big Rock Point in Michigan and Indian Point 1 in New York that were acquired when Entergy purchased the Palisades and Indian Point 2 nuclear plants, respectively. These facilities are in various stages of the decommissioning process. Both Big Rock Point and Indian Point 1 are under contract to be sold with their respective plants. 
Non-nuclear Generating Stations 
Entergy Wholesale Commodities includes the ownership, or interests in joint ventures that own, the following non-nuclear power plants: 
(a) &#8220;Net Owned Capacity&#8221; refers to the nameplate rating on the generating unit. 
(b) The owned MW capacity is the portion of the plant capacity owned by Entergy Wholesale Commodities. For a complete listing of Entergy&#8217;s jointly-owned generating stations, refer to &#8220; Jointly-Owned Generating Stations &#8221; in Note 1 to the financial statements. 
(c) Indirectly owned through an interest in an unconsolidated joint venture. In December 2020, Entergy&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary with a direct interest in RS Cogen, LLC entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with a subsidiary of the other 50% equity partner to sell its 50% membership interest in the joint venture to the equity partner. The targeted closing date for the transaction is October 2022. 
Independent System Operators 
The Indian Point plants fall under the authority of the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO). The Palisades plant falls under the authority of the MISO. The primary purpose of NYISO and MISO is to direct the operations of the major generation and transmission facilities in their respective regions; ensure grid reliability; administer and monitor wholesale electricity markets; and plan for their respective region&#8217;s energy needs. 
Energy and Capacity Sales 
As a wholesale generator, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; core business is selling energy, measured in MWh, to its customers. Entergy Wholesale Commodities enters into forward contracts with its customers and also sells energy in the day ahead or spot markets. Entergy Wholesale Commodities also sells unforced capacity, which allows load-serving entities to meet specified reserve and related requirements placed on them by the ISOs in their respective areas. Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; forward physical power contracts consist of contracts to sell energy only, contracts to sell capacity only, and bundled contracts in which it sells both capacity and energy. While the terminology and payment mechanics vary in these contracts, each of these types of contracts requires Entergy Wholesale Commodities to deliver MWh of energy, make capacity available, or both. See &#8220; Market and Credit Risk Sensitive Instruments &#8221; in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for additional information regarding these contracts. 
Part I Item 1 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
As part of the purchase of the Palisades plant in 2007, Entergy executed a 15-year PPA with the seller, Consumers Energy, for 100% of the plant&#8217;s output, excluding any future uprates. Under the purchased power agreement, Consumers Energy receives the value of any new environmental credits for the first ten years of the agreement. Palisades and Consumers Energy will share on a 50/50 basis the value of any new environmental credits for years 11 through 15 of the agreement. The environmental credits are defined as benefits from a change in law that causes capability of the plant as of the purchase date to become a tradable attribute (e.g., emission credit, renewable energy credit, environmental credit, &#8220;green&#8221; credit, etc.) or otherwise to have a market value. Entergy intends to shut down the Palisades nuclear power plant permanently on May 31, 2022 and transfer to Holtec thereafter. 
Customers 
Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; customers for the sale of both energy and capacity from its nuclear plants include retail power providers, utilities, electric power co-operatives, power trading organizations, and other power generation companies. These customers include Consumers Energy, the company from which Entergy purchased the Palisades plant, and NYISO and MISO. Substantially all the credit exposure associated with the planned energy output under contract for Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants is with counterparties or their guarantors that have public investment grade credit ratings. 
Competition 
The NYISO market is highly competitive. Entergy Wholesale Commodities has numerous competitors in New York including generation companies affiliated with regulated utilities, other independent power producers, municipal and co-operative generators, owners of co-generation plants and wholesale power marketers. Entergy Wholesale Commodities is an independent power producer, which means it generates power for sale to third parties at day ahead or spot market prices to the extent that the power is not sold under a fixed price contract. Municipal and co-operative generators also generate power but use most of it to deliver power to their municipal or co-operative power customers. Owners of co-generation plants produce power primarily for their own consumption. Wholesale power marketers do not own generation; rather they buy power from generators or other market participants and resell it to retail providers or other market participants. Competition in the New York power market is affected by, among other factors, the amount of generation and transmission capacity in these markets. MISO does not have a centralized clearing capacity market, but load serving entities do meet most of their capacity needs through bilateral contracts and self-supply with a smaller portion coming through voluntary MISO auctions. Almost all of Palisades&#8217; current output is contracted to Consumers Energy through May 2022. Entergy Wholesale Commodities does not expect to be materially affected by competition in the MISO market in the near term. 
Seasonality 
Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; revenues and operating income are subject to fluctuations during the year due to seasonal factors, weather conditions, and contract pricing. When outdoor and cooling water temperatures are low, generally during colder months, Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants operate more efficiently, and consequently, generate more electricity. Many of Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; contracts provide for shaped pricing over the course of the year. As a result of these factors, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; revenues are typically higher in the first and third quarters than in the second and fourth quarters. 
Fuel Supply 
Nuclear Fuel 
See &#8220; Fuel Supply - Nuclear Fuel &#8221; in the Utility portion of Part I, Item 1 for a discussion of the nuclear fuel cycle and markets. Entergy Nuclear Fuels Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary, is responsible for contracts to acquire nuclear materials, except for fuel fabrication, for Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, 
Part I Item 1 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
while Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. acts as the agent for the purchase of nuclear fuel assembly fabrication services. All contracts for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel are between the DOE and each of the nuclear power plant owners. The nuclear fuel supply portfolio for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment has been adjusted to reflect reduced overall requirements related to the planned permanent shutdowns of the Indian Point 3 and Palisades plants. Fuel procurement for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment was primarily limited to the requirements of the Palisades plant&#8217;s final refueling in 2020. 
Other Business Activities 
Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing, LLC (ENPM) was formed in 2005 to centralize the power marketing function for Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants. Upon its formation, ENPM entered into long-term power purchase agreements with the Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries that own nuclear power plants (generating subsidiaries). As part of a series of agreements, ENPM agreed to assume and/or otherwise service the existing power purchase agreements that were in effect between the generating subsidiaries and their customers. ENPM&#8217;s functions include origination of new energy and capacity transactions and generation scheduling. 
Services provided by either Entergy Nuclear, Inc. or other Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries include engineering, operations and maintenance, fuel procurement, management and supervision, technical support and training, administrative support, and other managerial or technical services required to operate, maintain, and decommission nuclear electric power facilities. 
TLG Services, a subsidiary in the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment, offers decommissioning, engineering, and related services to nuclear power plant owners. 
Entergy provides plant operation support services for the 800 MW Cooper Nuclear Station located near Brownville, Nebraska. In 2010 an Entergy subsidiary signed an agreement to extend the management support services to Cooper Nuclear Station by 15 years, through January 2029.

RISK FACTORS 
Investors should review carefully the following risk factors and the other information in this Form 10-K. The risks that Entergy faces are not limited to those in this section. There may be additional risks and uncertainties (either currently unknown or not currently believed to be material) that could adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. See &#8220; FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION .&#8221; 
Utility Regulatory Risks 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) 
The terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the Utility operating companies and System Energy are determined through regulatory approval proceedings that can be lengthy and subject to appeal that could result in delays in effecting rate changes and uncertainty as to ultimate results. 
The Utility operating companies are regulated on a cost-of-service and rate of return basis and are subject to statutes and regulatory commission rules and procedures. The rates that the Utility operating companies and System Energy charge reflect their capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, allowed rates of return, financing costs, and related costs of service. These rates significantly influence the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and each of the Utility operating companies and System Energy. These rates are determined in regulatory proceedings and are subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment, including adjustment upon the initiative of a regulator or affected stakeholders. 
In addition, regulators may initiate proceedings to investigate the prudence of costs in the Utility operating companies&#8217; base rates and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of the companies&#8217; operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures (including storm costs and costs associated with capital projects), allowed rates of return and rate base, proposed resource acquisitions, and previously incurred capital expenditures that the operating companies seek to place in rates. The regulators may disallow costs subject to their jurisdiction found not to have been prudently incurred or found not to have been incurred in compliance with applicable tariffs, creating some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or reduce rates. Traditional base rate proceedings, as opposed to formula rate plans, generally have long timelines, are primarily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited in scope or duration by statute. The length of these base rate proceedings can cause the Utility operating companies and System Energy to experience regulatory lag in recovering costs through rates, such that the Utility operating companies may not fully recover all costs during the rate effective period and the Utility operating companies may, therefore, earn less than their allowed returns. Decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings. 
The Utility operating companies have large customer and stakeholder bases and, as a result, could be the subject of public criticism or adverse publicity focused on issues including the operation of their assets and infrastructure or the quality of their service. Criticism or adverse publicity of this nature could render legislatures and other governing bodies, public service commissions and other regulatory authorities, and government officials less likely to view the applicable operating company in a favorable light and could potentially negatively affect legislative or regulatory processes or outcomes, as well as lead to increased regulatory oversight or more stringent legislative or regulatory requirements. 
The base rates of Entergy Texas are established largely in traditional base rate case proceedings. Between base rate proceedings, Entergy Texas has available rate riders to recover the revenue requirements associated with certain incremental costs. For example, Entergy Texas has recovered distribution-related capital investments through the distribution cost recovery factor rider mechanism, transmission-related capital investments and certain non-fuel MISO charges through the transmission cost recovery factor rider mechanism, and MISO fuel and energy-related costs 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
through the fixed fuel factor mechanism. Entergy Texas is also required to make a filing every three years, at a minimum, reconciling its fuel and purchased power costs and fuel factor revenues. In the course of this reconciliation, the PUCT determines whether eligible fuel and fuel-related expenses and revenues are necessary and reasonable, and makes a prudence finding for each of the fuel-related contracts for the reconciliation period. 
Between base rate cases, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi are able to adjust base rates annually through formula rate plans that utilize a forward test year (Entergy Arkansas) or forward-looking features (Entergy Mississippi). In response to Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s application for a general change in rates in 2015, the APSC approved the formula rate plan tariff proposed by Entergy Arkansas including its use of a projected year test period and an initial five-year term. The initial five-year term expires in 2021 unless Entergy Arkansas requests, and the APSC approves, the extension of the formula rate plan tariff for an additional five years through 2026. If Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s formula rate plan were terminated or not extended beyond the initial term, Entergy Arkansas could file an application for a general change in rates that may include a request for continued regulation under a formula rate review mechanism. If Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s formula rate plan is terminated, it would revert to the more traditional rate case environment or seek approval of a new formula rate plan. Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi recover fuel and purchased energy and certain non-fuel costs through other APSC-approved and MPSC-approved tariffs, respectively. 
Entergy Louisiana historically sets electric base rates annually through a formula rate plan using an historic test year. The form of the formula rate plan, on a combined basis, was approved in connection with the business combination of Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and largely followed the formula rate plans that were approved by the LPSC in connection with the full electric base rate cases filed by those companies in February 2013. The formula rate plan was most recently extended through the test year 2019; certain modifications were made in that extension, including a decrease to the allowed return on equity and the addition of a transmission cost recovery mechanism. The formula rate plan continues to include exceptions from the rate cap and sharing requirements for certain large capital investment projects, including acquisition or construction of generating facilities and purchase power agreements approved by the LPSC and as noted, for certain transmission investment, among other items. MISO fuel and energy-related costs are recoverable in Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s fuel adjustment clause. In the event that the electric formula rate plan is not renewed or extended, Entergy Louisiana would revert to the more traditional rate case environment. 
Entergy New Orleans previously operated under a formula rate plan that ended with the 2011 test year. Based on a settlement agreement approved by the City Council, with limited exceptions, the base rates of Entergy New Orleans were frozen until rates were implemented in connection with the base rate case filed by Entergy New Orleans in 2018. In November 2019 the City Council issued a resolution resolving the rate case, with rates to become effective retroactive to August 2019. The resolution allows Entergy New Orleans to implement a three-year formula rate plan, beginning with the 2019 test year as adjusted for forward-looking known and measurable changes. Entergy New Orleans has appealed the resolution. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion. 
The rates of System Energy are established by the FERC, and the costs allowed to be charged pursuant to these rates are, in turn, passed through to the participating Utility operating companies through the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which allows monthly adjustments to reflect the current operating costs of, and investment in, Grand Gulf. The Unit Power Sales Agreement is currently the subject of several litigation proceedings at the FERC, including a challenge with respect to System Energy&#8217;s authorized return on equity and capital structure and a request in a separate proceeding for FERC to initiate a broader investigation of rates under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the proceedings. The Utility operating companies have agreed to implement certain protocols for providing retail regulators with information regarding rates billed under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. 
The Utility operating companies and System Energy, and the energy industry as a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments, and an upward trend in spending, especially with respect to infrastructure investments, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future and could result in more frequent rate cases and 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
requests for, and the continuation of, cost recovery mechanisms. For information regarding rate case proceedings and formula rate plans applicable to the Utility operating companies, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 
Changes to state or federal legislation or regulation affecting electric generation, electric and natural gas transmission, distribution and related activities could adversely affect Entergy and the Utility operating companies&#8217; financial position, results of operations or cash flows and their utility businesses. 
If legislative and regulatory structures evolve in a manner that erodes the Utility operating companies&#8217; exclusive rights to serve their regulated customers, they could lose customers and sales and their results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be materially affected. Additionally, technological advances in energy efficiency and distributed energy resources are reducing the costs of these technologies and together with ongoing state and federal subsidies, the increasing penetration of these technologies could result in reduced sales by the Utility operating companies. Such loss of sales could put upward pressure on rates, resulting in adverse regulatory actions to mitigate such effects on rates. Entergy and the Utility operating companies cannot predict if or when they may be subject to changes in legislation or regulation, or the extent and timing of reductions of the cost of distributed energy resources, nor can they predict the impact of these changes on their results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
The Utility operating companies recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or disallowance in regulatory proceedings. 
The Utility operating companies recover their fuel, purchased power, and associated costs from their customers through rate mechanisms subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. Because regulatory review can result in the disallowance of incurred costs found not to have been prudently incurred, including the cost of replacement power purchased when generators experience outages, with the possibility of refunds to ratepayers, there exists some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulators may also initiate proceedings to investigate the continued usage or the adequacy and operation of the fuel and purchased power recovery clauses of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, there can be no assurance that existing recovery mechanisms will remain unchanged or in effect at all. 
The Utility operating companies&#8217; cash flows can be negatively affected by the time delays between when gas, power, or other commodities are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers of the costs in rates. On occasion, when the level of incurred costs for fuel and purchased power rises very dramatically, some of the Utility operating companies may agree to defer recovery of a portion of that period&#8217;s fuel and purchased power costs for recovery at a later date, which could increase the near-term working capital and borrowing requirements of those companies. For a description of fuel and purchased power recovery mechanisms and information regarding the regulatory proceedings for fuel and purchased power costs recovery, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 
There remains uncertainty regarding the effect of the termination of the System Agreement on the Utility operating companies. 
The Utility operating companies historically engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating resources and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which is a rate schedule that had been approved by the FERC. The System Agreement terminated in its entirety on August 31, 2016. 
There remains uncertainty regarding the long-term effect of the termination of the System Agreement on the Utility operating companies because of the significant effect of the agreement on the generation and transmission functions of the Utility operating companies and the significant period of time (over 30 years) that it had been in existence. In the absence of the System Agreement, there remains uncertainty around the effectiveness of governance processes and the potential absence of federal authority to resolve certain issues among the Utility operating companies and their retail regulators. 
In addition, although the System Agreement terminated in its entirety in August 2016, there are a number of outstanding System Agreement proceedings at the FERC that may require future adjustments, including challenges to 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
the level and timing of payments made by Entergy Arkansas under the System Agreement. The outcome and timing of these FERC proceedings and resulting recovery and impact on rates cannot be predicted at this time. 
For further information regarding the regulatory proceedings relating to the System Agreement, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 
The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the MISO markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs. The operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system pursuant to the MISO RTO tariff and their participation in the MISO RTO&#8217;s wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 
On December 19, 2013, the Utility operating companies integrated into the MISO RTO. MISO maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and administers wholesale energy and ancillary services markets for market participants in the MISO region, including the Utility operating companies. The Utility operating companies sell capacity, energy, and ancillary services on a bilateral basis to certain wholesale customers and offer available electricity production of their generating facilities into the MISO day-ahead and real-time energy markets pursuant to the MISO tariff and market rules. The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the MISO markets. MISO tariff rules and system conditions, including transmission congestion, could affect the Utility operating companies&#8217; ability to sell power in certain regions and/or the economic value of such sales, and MISO market rules may change in ways that cause additional risk. 
The Utility operating companies participate in the MISO regional transmission planning process and are subject to risks associated with planning decisions that MISO makes in the exercise of control over the planning of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission assets that are under MISO&#8217;s functional control. The Utility operating companies pay transmission rates that reflect the cost of transmission projects that the Utility operating companies do not own, which could increase cash or financing needs. MISO has made filings with FERC proposing changes in the transmission project criteria in MISO. These changes, if adopted, could potentially result in a larger volume of competitively bid and regionally cost allocated transmission projects. In addition to the cash and financing-related risks arising from the potential additional cost allocation to the Utility operating companies from these projects, there is a risk that the Utility operating companies&#8217; business and financial position could be harmed as a result of lost investment opportunities and other effects that flow from an increased number of competitive projects being approved and constructed that are interconnected with their transmission systems. Further, the terms and conditions of the MISO tariff, including provisions related to the design and implementation of wholesale markets, the allocation of transmission upgrade costs, the MISO-wide allowed base rate of return on equity, and any required MISO-related charges and credits are subject to regulation by the FERC. The operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system pursuant to the MISO tariff and their participation in the MISO wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. In addition, orders from each of the Utility operating companies&#8217; respective retail regulators generally require that the Utility operating companies make periodic filings, or generally allow the retail regulator to direct the making of such filings, setting forth the results of analysis of the costs and benefits realized from MISO membership as well as the projected costs and benefits of continued membership in MISO and/or requesting approval of their continued membership in MISO. These filings have been submitted periodically by each of the Utility operating companies as required by their respective retail regulators, and the outcome of the resulting proceedings may affect the Utility operating companies&#8217; continued membership in MISO.

A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred as a result of severe weather could have material effects on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather. 
Entergy&#8217;s and its Utility operating companies&#8217; results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition can be materially affected by the destructive effects of severe weather. Severe weather can also result in significant outages for the customers of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, reduced revenues for the Utility operating companies during the period of the outages. A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred or revenues lost as a result of severe weather could have a material effect on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather. 
Nuclear Operating, Shutdown and Regulatory Risks 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy) 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities must consistently operate their nuclear power plants at high capacity factors in order to be successful, and lower capacity factors could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Nuclear capacity factors significantly affect the results of operations of certain Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. Nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs. Consequently, to be successful, a plant owner must consistently operate its nuclear power plants at high capacity factors, consistent with safety requirements. For the Utility operating companies that own nuclear plants, lower capacity factors can increase production costs by requiring the affected companies to generate additional energy, sometimes at higher costs, from their owned or contractually controlled facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy their supply needs. For the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants, lower capacity factors directly affect revenues and cash flow from operations. Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; forward sales are comprised of various hedge products, many of which have some degree of operational-contingent price risk. Certain unit-contingent contracts guarantee specified minimum capacity factors. In the event plants with these contracts were operating below the guaranteed capacity factors, Entergy would be subject to price risk for the undelivered power. Further, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear forward sales contracts can also be on a firm LD basis, which subjects Entergy to increasing price risk as capacity factors decrease. Many of these firm hedge products have damages risk. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners periodically shut down their nuclear power plants to replenish fuel. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such refueling outages. If refueling outages last longer than anticipated or if unplanned outages arise, Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected. 
Outages at nuclear power plants to replenish fuel require the plant to be &#8220;turned off.&#8221; Refueling outages generally are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such planned outages, which typically extends the planned outage duration. When refueling outages last longer than anticipated or a plant experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease, and maintenance costs may increase. Lower than forecasted capacity factors may cause Entergy Wholesale Commodities to experience reduced revenues and may also create damages risk with certain hedge products as previously discussed. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities face risks related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication). These risks could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
Based upon currently planned fuel cycles, Entergy&#8217;s nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what Entergy believes are reasonably predictable prices through 2020 and beyond. The nuclear fuel supply portfolio for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment has been adjusted to reflect reduced overall requirements related to the planned permanent shutdown and sale of the Palisades, Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 plants over the next three years and fuel procurement is limited to the final refueling of the Palisades plant in 2020 . Entergy&#8217;s ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners. While there are a number of possible alternate suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, the pricing of any such alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time. Entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S. Market prices for nuclear fuel have been extremely volatile from time to time in the past and may be subject to increased volatility due to the imposition of tariffs, domestic purchase requirements or shifting trade arrangements between countries. Although Entergy&#8217;s nuclear fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against market risks for several years, costs for nuclear fuel in the future cannot be predicted with certainty due to normal inherent market uncertainties, and price changes could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
Entergy&#8217;s ability to assure nuclear fuel supply also depends upon the performance and reliability of conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services providers. These service providers are fewer in number than uranium suppliers. For conversion and enrichment services, Entergy diversifies its supply by supplier and country and may take special measures to ensure a reliable supply of enriched uranium for fabrication into nuclear fuel. For fabrication services, each plant is dependent upon the performance of the fabricator of that plant&#8217;s nuclear fuel; therefore, Entergy relies upon additional monitoring, inspection, and oversight of the fabrication process to assure reliability and quality of its nuclear fuel. Certain of the suppliers and service providers are located in or dependent upon countries, such as Russia, in which international sanctions or tariffs could restrict the ability of such suppliers to continue to supply fuel or provide such services at acceptable prices or at all. The inability of such suppliers or service providers to perform such obligations could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business face the risk that the NRC will change or modify its regulations, suspend or revoke their licenses, or increase oversight of their nuclear plants, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Under the Atomic Energy Act and Energy Reorganization Act, the NRC regulates the operation of nuclear power plants. The NRC may modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, related regulations, or the terms of the licenses for nuclear facilities. Interested parties may also intervene which could result in prolonged proceedings. A change in the Atomic Energy Act, other applicable statutes, or the applicable regulations or licenses, or the NRC&#8217;s interpretation thereof, may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and could materially affect the results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition of Entergy (through Entergy Wholesale Commodities), its Utility operating companies, or System Energy. A change in the classification of a plant owned by one of these companies under the NRC&#8217;s Reactor Oversight Process, which is the NRC&#8217;s program to collect information about plant performance, assess the information for its safety significance, and provide for appropriate licensee and NRC response, also could cause the owner of the plant to incur material additional costs as a result of the increased oversight activity and potential response costs associated with the change in classification. For additional information concerning the current classification of the plants owned by Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, System Energy, and 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see &#8220; Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business - Regulation of the Nuclear Power Industry - NRC Reactor Oversight Process &#8221; in Part I, Item 1 and Note 8 to the financial statements. 
Events at nuclear plants owned by one of these companies, as well as those owned by others, may lead to a change in laws or regulations or the terms of the applicable licenses, or the NRC&#8217;s interpretation thereof, or may cause the NRC to increase oversight activity or initiate actions to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility, or impose civil penalties. As a result, if an incident were to occur at any nuclear generating unit, whether an Entergy nuclear generating unit or not, it could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities are exposed to risks and costs related to operating and maintaining their nuclear power plants, and their failure to maintain operational efficiency at their nuclear power plants could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
The nuclear generating units owned by certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, &#160; and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business began commercial operations in the 1970s-1980s. Older equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating safely and efficiently. This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages, or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in increased costs, some of which costs may not be fully recoverable by the Utility operating companies and System Energy in regulatory proceedings should there be a determination of imprudence. Operations at any of the nuclear generating units owned and operated by Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries could degrade to the point where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. If this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. A decision may be made to close a unit rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the unit to full capacity. For the Utility operating companies and System Energy, this could result in certain costs being stranded and potentially not fully recoverable in regulatory proceedings. For Entergy Wholesale Commodities, this could result in lost revenue and increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments and penalties for failure to perform under their contracts with customers. In addition, the operation and maintenance of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear facilities require the commitment of substantial human resources that can result in increased costs. 
The nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to the effects of stress corrosion cracking and other corrosion mechanisms on certain materials within plant systems. The issue is applicable at all nuclear units to varying degrees and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines that include in-service examinations, replacements, and mitigation strategies. Developments in the industry or identification of issues at the nuclear units could require unanticipated remediation efforts that cannot be quantified in advance. 
Moreover, Entergy is becoming more dependent on fewer suppliers for key parts of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants that may need to be replaced or refurbished, and in some cases, parts are no longer available and have to be reverse-engineered for replacement. In addition, certain major parts have long lead-times to manufacture if an unplanned replacement is needed. This dependence on a reduced number of suppliers and long lead-times on certain major parts for unplanned replacements could result in delays in obtaining qualified replacement parts and, therefore, greater expense for Entergy. 
The costs associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, as well as the costs of and their ability to fully decommission their nuclear power plants, could be significantly affected by the timing of the opening of a spent nuclear fuel disposal facility, as well as interim storage and transportation requirements. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants incur costs for the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. The approval of a license for a national repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, such as the one proposed for Yucca Mountain, Nevada, or 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
any interim storage facility, and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. For example, while the DOE is required by law to proceed with the licensing of Yucca Mountain and, after the license is granted by the NRC, to construct the repository and commence the receipt of spent fuel, the NRC licensing of the Yucca Mountain repository is effectively at a standstill. These actions are prolonging the time before spent fuel is removed from Entergy&#8217;s plant sites. Because the DOE has not accomplished its objectives, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts, and Entergy has sued the DOE for such breach. Furthermore, Entergy is uncertain as to when the DOE will commence acceptance of spent fuel from its facilities for storage or disposal. As a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at the companies&#8217; nuclear sites and maintenance costs on existing storage facilities, including aging management of fuel storage casks, may increase. The costs of on-site storage are also affected by regulatory requirements for such storage. In addition, the availability of a repository or other off-site storage facility for spent nuclear fuel may affect the ability to fully decommission the nuclear units and the costs relating to decommissioning. For further information regarding spent fuel storage, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8211; Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#8211; Spent Fuel Disposal &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 8 to the financial statements. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to pay substantial retrospective premiums imposed under the Price-Anderson Act in the event of a nuclear incident, and losses not covered by insurance could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. 
Accidents and other unforeseen problems at nuclear power plants have occurred both in the United States and elsewhere. The Price-Anderson Act limits each reactor owner&#8217;s public liability (off-site) for a single nuclear incident to the payment of retrospective premiums into a secondary insurance pool, which is referred to as Secondary Financial Protection, up to approximately $137.6 million per reactor. With 98 reactors currently participating, this translates to a total public liability cap of approximately $14 billion per incident. The limit is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation, a change in the primary limit of insurance coverage, and changes in the number of licensed reactors. As required by the Price-Anderson Act, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities carry the maximum available amount of primary nuclear off-site liability insurance with American Nuclear Insurers, which is $450 million for each operating site. Claims for any nuclear incident exceeding that amount are covered under Secondary Financial Protection. As a result, in the event of a nuclear incident that causes damages (off-site) in excess of the primary insurance coverage, each owner of a nuclear plant reactor, including Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident, will be required to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the primary insurance level, up to a maximum of approximately $137.6 million per reactor per incident (Entergy&#8217;s maximum total contingent obligation per incident is $1.101 billion). The retrospective premium payment is currently limited to approximately $21 million per year per incident per reactor until the aggregate public liability for each licensee is paid up to the $137.6 million cap. 
NEIL is a utility industry mutual insurance company, owned by its members, including the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants. All member plants could be subject to an annual assessment (retrospective premium of up to 10 times current annual premium for all policies) should the NEIL surplus (reserve) be significantly depleted due to &#160; insured losses. As of December 31, 2019, the maximum annual assessment amounts total $112 million for the Utility plants. Retrospective premium insurance available through NEIL&#8217;s reinsurance treaty can cover the potential assessments and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants currently maintain the retrospective premium insurance to cover those potential assessments. 
As an owner of nuclear power plants, Entergy participates in industry self-insurance programs and could be liable to fund claims should a plant owned by a different company experience a major event. Any resulting liability from a nuclear accident may exceed the applicable primary insurance coverage and require contribution of additional funds through the industry-wide program that could significantly affect the results of operations, financial condition, 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
or liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries. 
The decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants owned by the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may not be adequate to meet decommissioning obligations if market performance and other changes decrease the value of assets in the decommissioning trusts, if one or more of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants is retired earlier than the anticipated shutdown date, if the plants cost more to decommission than estimated, or if current regulatory requirements change, which then could require significant additional funding. 
Owners of nuclear generating plants have an obligation to decommission those plants. Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants maintain decommissioning trust funds for this purpose. Certain of the Utility operating companies collect funds from their customers, which are deposited into the trusts covering the units operated for or on behalf of those companies. Those rate collections, as adjusted from time to time by rate regulators, are generally based upon operating license lives and trust fund balances as well as estimated trust fund earnings and decommissioning costs. Assets in these trust funds are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns that may fall below projected return rates, and may result in losses resulting from the recognition of impairments of the value of certain securities held in these trust funds. 
Under NRC regulations, nuclear plant owners are permitted to project the NRC-required decommissioning amount, based on an NRC formula or a site-specific estimate, and the amount that will be available in each nuclear power plant&#8217;s decommissioning trusts combined with any other decommissioning financial assurances in place. The projections are made based on the operating license expiration date and the mid-point of the subsequent decommissioning process, or the anticipated actual completion of decommissioning if a site-specific estimate is used. If the projected amount of each individual plant&#8217;s decommissioning trusts exceeds the NRC-required decommissioning amount, then its decommissioning obligations are considered to be funded in accordance with NRC regulations. If the projected costs do not sufficiently reflect the actual costs required to decommission these nuclear power plants, or funding is otherwise inadequate, or if the formula, formula inputs, or site-specific estimate is changed to require increased funding, additional resources or commitments would be required. Furthermore, depending upon the level of funding available in the trust funds, the NRC may not permit the trust funds to be used to pay for related costs such as the management of spent nuclear fuel that are not included in the NRC&#8217;s formula. The NRC may also require a plan for the provision of separate funding for spent fuel management costs. In addition to NRC requirements, there are other decommissioning-related obligations for certain of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, which management believes it will be able to satisfy. 
Further, federal or state regulatory changes, including mandated increases in decommissioning funding or changes in the methods or standards for decommissioning operations, may also increase the funding requirements of, or accelerate the timing for funding of, the obligations related to the decommissioning of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants or may restrict the decommissioning-related costs that can be paid from the decommissioning trusts. Such changes also could result in the need for additional contributions to decommissioning trusts, or the posting of parent guarantees, letters of credit, or other surety mechanisms. As a result, under any of these circumstances, Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially affected. 
An early plant shutdown (either generally or relative to current expectations), poor investment results or higher than anticipated decommissioning costs (including as a result of changing regulatory requirements) could cause trust fund assets to be insufficient to meet the decommissioning obligations, with the result that the Utility operating companies, System Energy or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to provide significant additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning, which, with respect to the Utility operating companies, may not be recoverable from customers in a timely fashion or at all.

power business, the impairment charges that resulted from such decision, and the planned sale of Palisades (which will include the transfer of the decommissioning trust), see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates - Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, the &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power Business &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries, and Notes 9 and 14 to the financial statements. 
New or existing safety concerns regarding operating nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel could lead to restrictions upon the operation and decommissioning of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants. 
New and existing concerns are being expressed in public forums about the safety of nuclear generating units and nuclear fuel. These concerns have led to, and may continue to lead to, various proposals to Federal regulators and governing bodies in some localities where Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries own nuclear generating units for legislative and regulatory changes that might lead to the shutdown of nuclear units, additional requirements or restrictions related to spent nuclear fuel on-site storage and eventual disposal, or other adverse effects on owning, operating and decommissioning nuclear generating units. Entergy vigorously responds to these concerns and proposals. If any of the existing proposals, or any proposals that may arise in the future with respect to legislative and regulatory changes, become effective, they could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. 
(Entergy Corporation) 
Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are exposed to price risk. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries do not have a regulator-authorized rate of return on their capital investments in non-utility businesses. As a result, the sale of capacity and energy from the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, unless otherwise contracted, is subject to the fluctuation of market power prices. In order to reduce future price risk to desired levels, Entergy Wholesale Commodities utilizes contracts that are unit-contingent and Firm LD and various products such as forward sales, options, and collars. As of December 31, 2019, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear power generation plants had sold forward 97% in 2020, 92% in 2021, and 66% in 2022 of its generation portfolio&#8217;s planned energy output, reflecting the planned shutdown and sale of the remaining Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants by mid-2022. 
Market conditions such as product cost, market liquidity, and other portfolio considerations influence the product and contractual mix. The obligations under unit-contingent agreements depend on a generating asset that is operating; if the generation asset is not operating, the seller generally is not liable for damages. For some unit-contingent obligations, however, there is also a guarantee of availability that provides for the payment to the power purchaser of contract damages, if incurred, in the event the unit owner fails to deliver power as a result of the failure of the specified generation unit to generate power at or above a specified availability threshold. Firm LD sales transactions may be exposed to substantial operational price risk, a portion of which may be capped through the use of risk management products, to the extent that the plants do not run as expected and market prices exceed contract prices. 
Market prices may fluctuate substantially, sometimes over relatively short periods of time, and at other times experience sustained increases or decreases. Demand for electricity and its fuel stock can fluctuate dramatically, creating periods of substantial under- or over-supply. During periods of over-supply, prices might be depressed. Also, from time to time there may be political pressure, or pressure from regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over wholesale and retail energy commodity and transportation rates, to impose price limitations, credit requirements, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address volatility and other issues in these markets. 
The effects of sustained low natural gas prices and power market structure challenges have resulted in lower market prices for electricity in the power regions where the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are located. In addition, currently the market design under which the plants operate does not adequately compensate merchant nuclear plants for their environmental and fuel diversity benefits in the region. These conditions were primary 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
factors leading to Entergy&#8217;s decision to shut down (or sell) Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear power plants before the end of their operating licenses (or requested operating licenses for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3). 
The price that different counterparties offer for various products including forward sales is influenced both by market conditions as well as the contract terms such as damage provisions, credit support requirements, and the number of available counterparties interested in contracting for the desired forward period. Depending on differences between market factors at the time of contracting versus current conditions, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; contract portfolio may have average contract prices above or below current market prices, including at the expiration of the contracts, which may significantly affect Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. New hedges are generally layered into on a rolling forward basis, which tends to drive hedge over-performance to market in a falling price environment, and hedge underperformance to market in a rising price environment; however, hedge timing, product choice, and hedging costs will also affect these results. See the &#8220; Market and Credit Risk Sensitive Instruments &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries. Since Entergy Wholesale Commodities has announced the closure (or sale) of its nuclear plants, Entergy Wholesale Commodities may enter into fewer forward sales contracts for output from such plants. 
The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative, regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 
The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and local laws. Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability. 
Public utilities under the Federal Power Act are required to obtain FERC acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity. Each of the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants that generates electricity, as well as Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing, LLC, is a &#8220;public utility&#8221; under the Federal Power Act by virtue of making wholesale sales of electric energy and/or owning wholesale electric transmission facilities. The FERC has granted these generating and power marketing companies the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. The FERC&#8217;s orders that grant the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; generating and power marketing companies market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if the FERC subsequently determines that the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if any of its generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority and potential penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation. If the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; generating or power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain the FERC&#8217;s acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have an adverse effect on the rates the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business charges for power from its facilities. 
The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules imposed by the existing Independent System Operators. The Independent System Operators that oversee most of the wholesale power markets may impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps and other mechanisms, to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets. These types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on the profitability of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business&#8217; generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets. For further information regarding federal, state and local laws and regulation applicable to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see the &#8220; Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business &#8221; section in Part I, Item 1. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
The regulatory environment applicable to the electric power industry is subject to changes as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. Entergy cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. In addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism, have raised claims that the competitive marketplace is not working because energy prices in wholesale markets exceed the marginal cost of operating nuclear power plants, and have made proposals to re-regulate the markets, impose a generation tax, or require divestitures by generating companies to reduce their market share. Other proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process, which could require material changes to business planning models. If competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, modified, discontinued, or delayed, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected. 
The power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to impairment charges in certain circumstances, which could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
Entergy reviews long-lived assets held in all of its business segments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of these assets is uncertain. Generally, the determination of recoverability is based on the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the operations of such assets. Projected net cash flows depend on the expected operating life of the assets, the future operating costs associated with the assets, the efficiency and availability of the assets and generating units, and the future market and price for energy and capacity over the remaining life of the assets. In particular, the remaining assets of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to further impairment in connection with the closure and sale of its nuclear power plants. Moreover, prior to the closure and sale of these plants, the failure of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows, an unfavorable change in forecasted operating results or cash flows, a reduction in the expected remaining useful life of a unit, or a decline in observable industry market multiples could all result in potential additional impairment charges for the affected assets. 
If Entergy concludes that any of its nuclear power plants is unlikely to operate through its planned shutdown date, which conclusion would be based on a variety of factors, such a conclusion could result in a further impairment of part or all of the carrying value of the plant. Any impairment charge taken by Entergy with respect to its long-lived assets, including the remaining power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, would likely be material in the quarter that the charge is taken and could otherwise have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. For further information regarding evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates - Impairment of Long-lived Assets and Trust Fund Investments &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries and for further discussion of the impairment charges, see Note 14 to the financial statements. 
General Business 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 
Entergy and the Utility operating companies depend on access to the capital markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could make it more difficult to handle future contingencies such as natural disasters or substantial increases in gas and fuel prices. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and the cost of capital. 
Entergy&#8217;s business is capital intensive and dependent upon its ability to access capital at reasonable rates and 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
other terms. At times there are also spikes in the price for natural gas and other commodities that increase the liquidity requirements of the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. In addition, Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather-related or unforeseen disaster similar to that experienced in Entergy&#8217;s service territory with Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in 2005, Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike in 2008, and Hurricane Isaac in 2012. The occurrence of one or more contingencies, including a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel or purchased power costs or storm restoration costs, an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines, less cash flow from operations than expected, changes in regulation or governmental policy (including tax and trade policy), or other unknown events, could cause the financing needs of Entergy and its subsidiaries to increase. In addition, accessing the debt capital markets more frequently in these situations may result in an increase in leverage. Material leverage increases could negatively affect the credit ratings of Entergy and the Utility operating companies, which in turn could negatively affect access to the capital markets. 
The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of high interest rates, and uncertainty or reduced liquidity in the capital markets, could negatively affect Entergy and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to maintain and to expand their businesses. Access to capital markets could be restricted and/or borrowing costs could be increased due to certain sources of debt and equity capital being unwilling to invest in companies that experience extreme weather events, that rely on fossil fuels or offerings to fund fossil fuel projects, or due to risks related to climate change. Events beyond Entergy&#8217;s control may create uncertainty that could increase its cost of capital or impair its ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on its bank credit facilities. Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their credit facilities as they come up for renewal. Moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. If Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could impact their ability to grow their businesses, decrease earnings, significantly reduce financial flexibility and/or limit Entergy Corporation&#8217;s ability to sustain its current common stock dividend level. 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) 
A downgrade in Entergy Corporation &#8217; s or its subsidiaries &#8217; credit ratings could negatively affect Entergy Corporation &#8217; s and its subsidiaries &#8217; ability to access capital and/or could require Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries to post collateral, accelerate certain payments, or repay certain indebtedness. 
There are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for each of Entergy Corporation and the Registrant Subsidiaries, including each Registrant&#8217;s regulatory framework, ability to recover costs and earn returns, diversification and financial strength and liquidity. If one or more rating agencies downgrade Entergy Corporation&#8217;s, any of the Utility operating companies&#8217;, or System Energy&#8217;s ratings, particularly below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and cash or letter of credit collateral demands may be triggered by the terms of a number of commodity contracts, leases, and other agreements. 
Most of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; suppliers and counterparties require sufficient creditworthiness to enter into transactions. If Entergy Corporation&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; ratings decline, particularly below investment grade, or if certain counterparties believe Entergy Corporation or the Utility operating companies are losing creditworthiness and demand adequate assurance under fuel, gas, and purchased power contracts, the counterparties may require posting of collateral in cash or letters of credit, prepayment for fuel, gas or purchased power or accelerated payment, or counterparties may decline business with Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2019, based on power prices at that time, Entergy had liquidity exposure of $78 million under the guarantees in place supporting Entergy Wholesale Commodities transactions and $19 million of posted cash collateral. In the event of a decrease in Entergy Corporation&#8217;s credit rating to below investment grade, based on power prices as 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
of December 31, 2019, Entergy would have been required to provide approximately $30 million of additional cash or letters of credit under some of the agreements. As of December 31, 2019, the liquidity exposure associated with Entergy Wholesale Commodities assurance requirements, including return of previously posted collateral from counterparties, would increase by $90 million for a $1 per MMBtu increase in gas prices in both the short- and long-term markets. 
Recent U.S. tax legislation may materially adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 significantly changed the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, including taxation of U.S. corporations, by, among other things, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, and altering the expensing of capital expenditures. The legislation and interpretive guidance from the IRS are unclear in certain respects and will require further interpretations and implementing regulations by the IRS, as well as state tax authorities, and the legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase certain impacts of the legislation. 
As further described in Note 3 to the financial statements, as a result of amortization of accumulated deferred income taxes and payment of such amounts to customers in 2019, Entergy&#8217;s net regulatory liability for income taxes balance is $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2019. Depending on the outcome of IRS examinations or tax positions and elections that Entergy may make, Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries may be required to record additional charges or credits to income tax expense. Further, there may be other material effects resulting from the legislation that have not been identified. 
For further information regarding the effects of the Act, see the &#8220; Income Tax Legislation &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy. Also, Note 3 to the financial statements contains additional discussion of the effect of the Act on 2017, 2018 and 2019 results of operations and financial position, the provisions of the Act, and the uncertainties associated with accounting for the Act, and Note 2 to the financial statements discusses the regulatory proceedings that have considered the effects of the Act. 
Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact Entergy&#8217;s, the Utility operating companies&#8217;, and System Energy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes. These judgments include provisions for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. Entergy and its subsidiaries also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. Changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by Entergy and its subsidiaries could negatively affect Entergy&#8217;s, the Utility operating companies&#8217;, and System Energy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. For further information regarding Entergy&#8217;s income taxes, see Note 3 to the financial statements. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to successfully execute on their business strategies, including their ability to complete strategic transactions, is subject to significant risks, and, as a result, they may be unable to achieve some or all of the anticipated results of such strategies, which could materially affect their future prospects, results of operations and benefits that they anticipate from such transactions. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries&#8217; future prospects and results of operations significantly depend on their ability to successfully implement their business strategies, which are subject to business, regulatory, economic and other risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond their control. As a result, Entergy and its subsidiaries may be unable to fully achieve the anticipated results of such strategies. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Additionally, Entergy and its subsidiaries have pursued and may continue to pursue strategic transactions including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring or other strategic transactions. For example, Entergy has entered into an agreement to sell its equity interests in the subsidiary that owns the Palisades Nuclear Plant and the decommissioned Big Rock Point Nuclear Power Plant and an agreement to sell the equity interests of Indian Point 1, Indian Point 2, and Indian Point 3, in each case after each of the plants has been shut down and defueled. Also, a significant portion of Entergy&#8217;s utility business over the next several years includes the construction and /or purchase of a variety of generating units. These transactions and plans are or may become subject to regulatory approval and other material conditions or contingencies. The failure to complete these transactions or plans or any future strategic transaction successfully or on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; financial condition or results of operations and the market&#8217;s perception of Entergy&#8217;s ability to execute its strategy. Further, these transactions, and any completed or future strategic transactions, involve substantial risks, including the following: 
acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels; 
acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate; 
Entergy and/or its subsidiaries may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to them, that exceed their estimates, or for which their rights to indemnification from the seller are limited; 
Entergy may experience issues integrating businesses into its internal controls over financial reporting; 
the disposition of a business, including Entergy&#8217;s planned exit from the merchant power business, could divert management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns; 
Entergy and/or its subsidiaries may be unable to obtain the necessary regulatory or governmental approvals to close a transaction, such approvals may be granted subject to terms that are unacceptable to them, or Entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve anticipated regulatory treatment of any such transaction or acquired business or assets; and 
Entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that they anticipate from the transaction, or such benefits may be delayed or may not occur at all. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that they may encounter in acquiring or divesting a business, or engaging in other strategic transactions, which could have a material effect on their business, financial condition or results of operations. 
The completion of capital projects, including the construction of power generation facilities, and other capital improvements involve substantial risks. Should such efforts be unsuccessful, the financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies could be materially affected. 
Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; ability to complete capital projects, including the construction of power generation facilities, or make other capital improvements, in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. These variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise, escalating costs for materials, labor, and environmental compliance, and reliance on suppliers for timely and satisfactory performance. Delays in obtaining permits, shortages in materials and qualified labor, levels of public support or opposition, suppliers and contractors not performing as expected or required under their contracts and/or experiencing financial problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations under contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, poor quality initial cost estimates from contractors, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel costs, or materials costs, downward changes in the economy, changes in law or regulation, including environmental compliance requirements, and other events beyond the control of the Utility operating companies or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost, and performance of these projects. If these projects or other capital improvements are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, Entergy and the Utility operating companies could incur additional costs and termination payments, or face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project. In addition, the Utility operating companies could be exposed to higher costs and market volatility, which could affect cash flow and cost recovery, should their respective regulators decline to approve the construction of the project or new generation needed to meet the reliability needs of customers at the lowest reasonable cost.

For further information regarding capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital in connection with capital projects, including the potential construction and/or purchase of additional generation supply sources within the Utility operating companies&#8217; service territory, and as to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see the &#8220; Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of the Registrant Subsidiaries. 
Failure to attract, retain and manage an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively affect Entergy or its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations. 
We rely on a large and changing workforce of team members, including employees, contractors and temporary staffing. Certain events, such as an aging workforce, mismatching of skill sets, failing to appropriately anticipate future workforce needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge base and the time required for skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may increase. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business, especially considering the workforce needs associated with nuclear generation facilities and new skills required to operate a modernized, technology-enabled power grid. If Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to successfully attract, retain and manage an appropriately qualified workforce, their results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be negatively affected. 
The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters. 
The businesses in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation by local, state, and federal authorities. These laws and regulations affect the manner in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business conduct their operations and make capital expenditures. These laws and regulations also affect how the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business manage air emissions, discharges to water, wetlands impacts, solid and hazardous waste storage and disposal, cooling and service water intake, the protection of threatened and endangered species, certain migratory birds and eagles, hazardous materials transportation, and similar matters. Federal, state, and local authorities continually revise these laws and regulations, and the laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and to the permitting and enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. Developing and implementing plans for facility compliance with these requirements can lead to capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures. Violations of these requirements can subject the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties&#8217; claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. In addition, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business potentially are subject to liability under these laws for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned or operated by the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. The Utility operating companies are currently involved in proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been released and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance. 
Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury, particulates, greenhouse gases, and other regulated air emissions from generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulation, controls and mitigation expenses. In addition, existing air regulations and programs promulgated by the EPA often are challenged legally, or are revised or withdrawn by the EPA, sometimes resulting in large-scale changes to anticipated regulatory regimes and the resulting need to shift course, both operationally and economically, depending on the nature of the changes. Risks relating to 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
global climate change, initiatives to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions, and water availability issues are discussed below. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if Entergy and its subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, the operation of its facilities could be stopped or become subject to additional costs. For further information regarding environmental regulation and environmental matters, see the &#8220; Regulation of Entergy &#8217; s Business &#8211; Environmental Regulation &#8221; section of Part I, Item 1. 
The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs related to reliability standards. 
Entergy&#8217;s business is subject to extensive and mandatory reliability standards. Such standards, which are established by the NERC, the SERC, and other regional enforcement entities, are approved by the FERC and frequently are reviewed, amended, and supplemented. Failure to comply with such standards could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of such standards. The standards, as well as the laws and regulations that govern them, are subject to judicial interpretation and to the enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. In addition to exposure to civil penalties and fines, the Utility operating companies have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to compliance with new and existing reliability standards, including costs associated with the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system and generation assets. In addition, the retail regulators of the Utility operating companies possess the jurisdiction, and in some cases have exercised such jurisdiction, to impose standards governing the reliable operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; distribution systems, including penalties if these standards are not met. The changes to the reliability standards applicable to the electric power industry are ongoing, and Entergy cannot predict the ultimate effect that the reliability standards will have on its Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities businesses. 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 
Weather, economic conditions, technological developments, and other factors may have a material impact on electricity and gas usage and otherwise materially affect the Utility operating companies &#8217; results of operations. 
Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase electric cooling demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels in the winter tend to increase electric and gas heating demand and revenues. As a corollary, mild temperatures in either season tend to decrease energy usage and resulting revenues. Higher consumption levels coupled with seasonal pricing differentials typically cause the Utility operating companies to report higher revenues in the third quarter of the fiscal year than in the other quarters. Extreme weather conditions including hurricanes or tropical storms, flooding events, or ice storms may stress the Utility operating companies&#8217; generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on their ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and reduced customer satisfaction. These extreme conditions could have a material effect on the Utility operating companies&#8217; financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
Entergy&#8217;s electricity sales volumes are affected by a number of factors including weather and economic conditions, trends in energy efficiency, new technologies and self-generation alternatives, including the willingness and ability of large industrial customers to develop co-generation facilities that greatly reduce their grid demand. Some of these factors are inherently cyclical or temporary in nature, such as the weather or economic conditions, and rarely have a long-lasting effect on Entergy&#8217;s operating results. Others, such as the organic turnover of appliances and their replacement with more efficient ones, adoption of newer technologies including smart thermostats, new building codes, distributed energy resources, energy storage, demand side management, and rooftop solar are having a more permanent effect by reducing sales growth rates from historical norms. As a result of these emerging efficiencies and technologies, the Utility operating companies may lose customers or experience lower average use per customer in the residential and commercial classes, and continuing advances have the potential to further limit sales growth in the future. The 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Utility operating companies also may face competition from other companies offering products and services to Entergy&#8217;s customers. Electricity sales to industrial customers, in particular, benefit from steady economic growth and favorable commodity markets; however, industrial sales are sensitive to changes in conditions in the markets in which its customers operate. Negative changes in any of these or other factors, particularly sustained economic downturns or sluggishness, have the potential to result in slower sales growth or sales declines and increased bad debt expense, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
The effects of climate change and environmental and regulatory obligations intended to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions or increase clean or renewable energy requirements or to place a price on greenhouse gas emissions could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. 
In an effort to address climate change concerns, some federal, state, and local authorities are calling for additional laws and regulations aimed at known or suspected causes of climate change. For example, in response to the United States Supreme Court&#8217;s 2007 decision holding that the EPA has authority to regulate emissions of CO 2 and other &#8220;greenhouse gases&#8221; under the Clean Air Act, the EPA, various environmental interest groups, and other organizations focused considerable attention on CO 2 emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. In 2010, the EPA promulgated its first regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from certain vehicles and from new and significantly modified stationary sources of emissions, including electric generating units. During 2012 and 2014, the EPA proposed CO 2 emission standards for new and existing sources. The EPA finalized these standards in 2015; however, in June 2019, the EPA repealed and replaced certain aspects of those regulations. As examples of state action, in the Northeast, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative establishes a cap on CO 2 emissions from electric power plants and requires generators to purchase emission permits to cover their CO 2 emissions, and a similar program has been developed in California. The impact that continued changes in the governmental response to climate change risk will have on existing and pending environmental laws and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions is currently unclear. 
Developing and implementing plans for compliance with greenhouse gas emissions reduction or clean/renewable energy requirements can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing facilities and proposed projects. The operations of low or non-emitting generating units (such as nuclear units) at lower than expected capacity factors could require increased generation from higher emitting units, thus increasing the company&#8217;s greenhouse gas emission rate. Moreover, long-term planning to meet environmental requirements can be negatively impacted and costs may increase to the extent laws and regulations change prior to full implementation. These requirements could, in turn, lead to changes in the planning or operations of balancing authorities or organized markets in areas where the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or Entergy Wholesale Commodities do business. Violations of such requirements may subject Entergy Wholesale Commodities and the Utility operating companies to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties&#8217; claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. To the extent Entergy believes any of these costs are recoverable in rates, however, additional material rate increases for customers could be resisted by Entergy&#8217;s regulators and, in extreme cases, Entergy&#8217;s regulators might deny or defer timely recovery of these costs. Future changes in environmental regulation governing the emission of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases or mix of generation sources could (i) result in significant additional costs to Entergy&#8217;s utility operating companies, their suppliers or customers, (ii) make some of Entergy&#8217;s electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, (iii) result in the early retirement of generation facilities and stranded costs if Entergy&#8217;s utility operating companies are unable to fully recover the costs and investment in generation and (iv) could increase the difficulty that Entergy and its utility operating companies have with obtaining or maintaining required environmental regulatory approvals, each of which could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of Entergy and its subsidiaries. In addition, lawsuits have occurred or are reasonably expected against emitters of greenhouse gases alleging that these companies are liable for personal injuries and property damage caused by climate change. These lawsuits may seek injunctive relief, monetary compensation, and punitive damages.

In addition to the regulatory and financial risks associated with climate change discussed above, potential physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level, wind and storm surge damages, wildfires, wetland and barrier island erosion, risks of flooding and changes in weather conditions, (such as increases in precipitation, drought, or changes in average temperatures), and potential increased impacts of extreme weather conditions or storms. Entergy subsidiaries own assets in, and serve, communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, storms, and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands. A significant portion of the nation&#8217;s oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by the physical impacts of climate change, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes. Entergy and its subsidiaries also face the risk that climate change could impact the availability and quality of water supply necessary for operations. 
These and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on the Entergy System&#8217;s ability to meet peak customer demand, more frequent and longer lasting outages, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. Also, to the extent that climate change adversely impacts the economic health of a region or results in energy conservation or demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and revenues. Such physical or operational risks could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217;, System Energy&#8217;s, and the Utility operating companies&#8217; financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
Continued and future availability and quality of water for cooling, process, and sanitary uses could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. 
Water is a vital natural resource that is also critical to the Utility operating companies&#8217;, System Energy&#8217;s, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; business operations. Entergy&#8217;s facilities use water for cooling, boiler make-up, sanitary uses, potable supply, and many other uses. Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies also own and/or operate hydroelectric facilities. Accordingly, water availability and quality are critical to Entergy&#8217;s business operations. Impacts to water availability or quality could negatively impact both operations and revenues. 
Entergy secures water through various mechanisms (ground water wells, surface waters intakes, municipal supply, etc.) and operates under the provisions and conditions set forth by the provider and/or regulatory authorities. Entergy also obtains and operates in substantial compliance with water discharge permits issued under various provisions of the Clean Water Act and/or state water pollution control provisions. Regulations and authorizations for both water intake and use and for waste discharge can become more stringent in times of water shortages, low flows in rivers, low lake levels, low groundwater aquifer volumes, and similar conditions. The increased use of water by industry, agriculture, and the population at large, population growth, and the potential impacts of climate change on water resources may cause water use restrictions that affect Entergy and its subsidiaries. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity prices, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
To manage near-term financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, Entergy and its subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, may enter into contracts to hedge portions of their purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements, and inventories of natural gas, uranium and its conversion and enrichment, coal, refined products, and other commodities, within established risk management guidelines. As part of this strategy, Entergy and its subsidiaries may utilize fixed- and variable-price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. However, Entergy and its subsidiaries normally cover only a portion of the exposure of their assets and positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. In addition, Entergy also elects to leave certain volumes during certain years unhedged. To the extent Entergy and its subsidiaries have unhedged positions, 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
fluctuating commodity prices can materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations and financial position. 
Although Entergy and its subsidiaries devote a considerable effort to these risk management strategies, they cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these activities. As a result of these and other factors, Entergy and its subsidiaries cannot predict with precision the impact that risk management decisions may have on their business, results of operations, or financial position. 
Entergy&#8217;s over-the-counter financial derivatives are subject to rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that are designed to promote transparency, mitigate systemic risk and protect against market abuse. Entergy cannot predict the impact any proposed or not fully-implemented final rules will have on its ability to hedge its commodity price risk or on over-the-counter derivatives markets as a whole, but such rules and regulations could have a material effect on Entergy's risk exposure, as well as reduce market liquidity and further increase the cost of hedging activities. 
Entergy has guaranteed or indemnified the performance of a portion of the obligations relating to hedging and risk management activities. Reductions in Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; credit quality or changes in the market prices of energy commodities could increase the cash or letter of credit collateral required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management activities, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity and financial position. 
The Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations, which may materially affect the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
The hedging and risk management practices of the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe Entergy and its subsidiaries money, energy, or other commodities will not perform their obligations. Currently, some hedging agreements contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure all or part of their obligations to Entergy or its subsidiaries. If the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, Entergy or its subsidiaries may enforce and recover the proceeds from the credit support provided and acquire alternative hedging arrangements, which credit support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. In such event, Entergy and its subsidiaries might incur losses in addition to amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. In addition, the credit commitments of Entergy&#8217;s lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such lenders, which could materially affect the adequacy of its liquidity sources. 
Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require additional funding and result in increased benefit plan costs. 
The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under Entergy&#8217;s pension and postretirement benefit plans. A decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements relating to Entergy&#8217;s benefit plan liabilities and also result in higher benefit costs. As the value of the assets decreases, the &#8220;expected return on assets&#8221; component of benefit costs decreases, resulting in higher benefits costs. Additionally, asset losses are incorporated into benefit costs over time, thus increasing benefits costs. Volatility in the capital markets has affected the market value of these assets, which may affect Entergy&#8217;s planned levels of contributions in the future. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Entergy&#8217;s pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding and recognition of higher liability carrying costs. The funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans can also increase as a result of changes in, among other factors, retirement rates, life expectancy assumptions, or Federal regulations. For further information regarding Entergy&#8217;s pension and other postretirement benefit plans, refer to the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#8211; Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of its Registrant Subsidiaries and Note 11 to the financial statements. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
The litigation environment in the states in which certain Entergy subsidiaries operate poses a significant risk to those businesses. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, asbestos, hazardous material and ratepayer matters, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters. The states in which the Utility operating companies operate, in particular Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, have proven to be unusually litigious environments. Judges and juries in these states have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort cases. Entergy and its subsidiaries use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against them, but the litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk. 
Terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, system failures or data breaches of Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; or our suppliers&#8217; technology systems may adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s results of operations. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries operate in a business that requires evolving information technology systems that include sophisticated data collection, processing systems, software, network infrastructure and other technologies that are becoming more complex and may be subject to mandatory and prescriptive reliability and security standards. The functionality of Entergy&#8217;s technology systems depends on its own and its suppliers&#8217; and their contractors&#8217; technology. Suppliers&#8217; and their contractors&#8217; technology systems to which Entergy is connected directly or indirectly support a variety of business processes and activities to store sensitive data, including (i) intellectual property, (ii) proprietary business information, (iii) personally identifiable information of customers and employees, and (iv) data with respect to invoicing and the collection of payments, accounting, procurement, and supply chain activities. Any significant failure or malfunction of such information technology systems could result in loss of data or disruptions of operations. 
There have been attacks and threats of attacks on energy infrastructure by cyber actors, including those associated with foreign governments. As an operator of critical infrastructure, Entergy and its subsidiaries face heightened risk of an act or threat of terrorism, cyber attacks, and data breaches, whether as a direct or indirect act against one of Entergy&#8217;s generation, transmission or distribution facilities, operations centers, infrastructure, or information technology systems used to manage, monitor, and transport power to customers and perform day-to-day business functions. An actual act could affect Entergy&#8217;s ability to operate, including its ability to operate the information technology systems and network infrastructure on which it relies to conduct business. 
Given the rapid technological advancements of existing and emerging threats, Entergy&#8217;s technology systems remain inherently vulnerable despite implementations and enhancements of the multiple layers of security and controls. If Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; technology systems were compromised and unable to detect or recover in a timely fashion to a normal state of operations, Entergy or its subsidiaries could be unable to perform critical business functions that are essential to the company&#8217;s well-being and could result in a loss of its confidential, sensitive, and proprietary information, including personal information of its customers, employees, suppliers, and others in Entergy&#8217;s care. Although malware was discovered on Entergy&#8217;s business network in 2018, it was remediated on a timely basis and did not affect Entergy&#8217;s operational systems, generation plants (including nuclear), or transmission and distribution networks, nor did it have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s business operations. 
Any such attacks, failures or data breaches could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation. Insurance may not be adequate to cover losses that might arise in connection with these events. Such events may also expose Entergy to an increased risk of litigation (and associated damages and fines).

(Entergy New Orleans) 
The effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers taking gas service may adversely affect Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s results of operations and liquidity. 
Gas rates charged to retail gas customers are comprised primarily of purchased gas cost charges, which provide no return or profit to Entergy New Orleans, and distribution charges, which provide a return or profit to the utility. Distribution charges recover fixed costs on a volumetric basis and, thus, are affected by the amount of gas sold to customers. When purchased gas cost charges increase due to higher gas procurement costs, customer usage may decrease, especially in weaker economic times, resulting in lower distribution charges for Entergy New Orleans, which could adversely affect results of operations. Purchased gas cost charges, which comprise most of a customer&#8217;s bill and may be adjusted monthly, represent gas commodity costs that Entergy New Orleans recovers from its customers. Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s cash flows can be affected by differences between the time period when gas is purchased and the time when ultimate recovery from customers occurs. 
(System Energy) 
System Energy owns and, through an affiliate, operates a single nuclear generating facility, and it is dependent on affiliated companies for all of its revenues. 
System Energy&#8217;s operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% ownership/leasehold interest in Grand Gulf. Charges under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are paid by the Utility operating companies as consideration for their respective entitlements to receive capacity and energy. The useful economic life of Grand Gulf is finite and is limited by the terms of its operating license, which expires in November 2044. System Energy&#8217;s financial condition depends both on the receipt of payments from the Utility operating companies under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and on the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf. The Unit Power Sales Agreement is currently the subject of several litigation proceedings at the FERC, including a challenge with respect to System Energy&#8217;s authorized return on equity and capital structure and a request in separate proceeding for FERC to initiate a broader investigation of rates under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the proceedings. The Utility operating companies have agreed to implement certain protocols for providing retail regulators with information regarding rates billed under the Unit Power Sales Agreement. 
For information regarding the Unit Power Sales Agreement, the sale and leaseback transactions and certain other agreements relating to the Entergy System companies&#8217; support of System Energy, see Notes 8 and 10 to the financial statements and the &#8220; Utility - System Energy and Related Agreements &#8221; section of Part I, Item 1. 
(Entergy Corporation) 
As a holding company, Entergy Corporation depends on cash distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock. 
Entergy Corporation is a holding company with no material revenue generating operations of its own or material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, all of its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. Entergy Corporation&#8217;s ability to satisfy its financial obligations, including the payment of interest and principal on its outstanding debt, and to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the payment to it of dividends or distributions by its subsidiaries. The subsidiaries of Entergy Corporation are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any dividends or make distributions to Entergy Corporation. The ability of such subsidiaries to make payments of dividends or distributions to Entergy Corporation depends on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings, and on any applicable legal, regulatory, or contractual limitations on subsidiaries&#8217; ability to pay such dividends or distributions. Prior to providing funds to Entergy Corporation, such subsidiaries have financial and regulatory obligations that must be satisfied, including among others, debt service and, in the case of Entergy Utility Holding Company and Entergy Texas, dividends and distributions on preferred securities. Any distributions from the Registrant Subsidiaries other than Entergy Texas and System Energy 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
are paid directly to Entergy Utility Holding Company and are therefore subject to prior payment of distributions on its preferred securities.

RISK FACTORS 
Investors should review carefully the following risk factors and the other information in this Form 10-K. The risks that Entergy faces are not limited to those in this section. There may be additional risks and uncertainties (either currently unknown or not currently believed to be material) that could adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. See &#8220; FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION .&#8221; 
Utility Regulatory Risks 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) 
The terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the Utility operating companies and System Energy are determined through regulatory approval proceedings that can be lengthy and subject to appeal that could result in delays in effecting rate changes and uncertainty as to ultimate results. 
The rates that the Utility operating companies and System Energy charge reflect their capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, allowed rates of return, financing costs, and related costs of service. These rates significantly influence the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and each of the Utility operating companies and System Energy. These rates are determined in regulatory proceedings and are subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment, including adjustment upon the initiative of a regulator or affected stakeholders. 
In addition, regulators may initiate proceedings to investigate the prudence of costs in the Utility operating companies&#8217; base rates and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of the companies&#8217; operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures (including storm costs and costs associated with capital projects), allowed rates of return and rate base, proposed resource acquisitions, and previously incurred capital expenditures that the operating companies seek to place in rates. The regulators may disallow costs subject to their jurisdiction found not to have been prudently incurred or found not to have been incurred in compliance with applicable tariffs, creating some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or reduce rates. Traditional base rate proceedings, as opposed to formula rate plans, generally have long timelines, are primarily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited in scope or duration by statute. The length of these base rate proceedings can cause the Utility operating companies and System Energy to experience regulatory lag in recovering costs through rates. Decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings. 
The base rates of Entergy Texas are established largely in traditional base rate case proceedings. Apart from base rate proceedings, Entergy Texas has also filed to use rate riders to recover the revenue requirements associated with certain authorized historical costs. For example, Entergy Texas has recovered distribution-related capital investments through the distribution cost recovery factor rider mechanism, transmission-related capital investments and certain non-fuel MISO charges through the transmission cost recovery factor rider mechanism, and MISO fuel and energy-related costs through the fixed fuel factor mechanism. Entergy Texas is also required to make a filing every three years, at a minimum, reconciling its fuel and purchased power costs and fuel factor revenues. In the course of this reconciliation, the PUCT determines whether eligible fuel and fuel-related expenses and revenues are necessary and reasonable, and makes a prudence finding for each of the fuel-related contracts for the reconciliation period. 
Between base rate cases, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi are able to adjust base rates annually through formula rate plans that utilize a forward test year (Entergy Arkansas) or forward-looking features (Entergy Mississippi). In response to Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s application for a general change in rates in 2015, the APSC approved the formula rate plan tariff proposed by Entergy Arkansas including its use of a projected year test period and an initial five-year term. The initial five-year term expires in 2021 unless Entergy Arkansas requests, and the APSC approves, the extension of the formula rate plan tariff for an additional five years through 2026. In the event that Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s formula rate plan is terminated or is not extended beyond the initial term, Entergy Arkansas could file an 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
application for a general change in rates that may include a request for continued regulation under a formula rate review mechanism. If Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s formula rate plan is terminated, it would revert to the more traditional rate case environment or seek approval of a new formula rate plan. Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi recover fuel and purchased energy and certain non-fuel costs through other APSC-approved and MPSC-approved tariffs, respectively. 
Entergy Louisiana historically sets electric base rates annually through a formula rate plan using an historic test year. The form of the formula rate plan, on a combined basis, was approved in connection with the business combination of Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and largely followed the formula rate plans that were approved by the LPSC in connection with the full electric base rate cases filed by those companies in February 2013. The formula rate plan has been extended through the test year 2019; certain modifications were made in that extension, including a decrease to the allowed return on equity and the addition of a transmission cost recovery mechanism. The formula rate plan continues to include exceptions from the rate cap and sharing requirements for certain large capital investment projects, including acquisition or construction of generating facilities and purchase power agreements approved by the LPSC and as noted, for certain transmission investment, among other items. MISO fuel and energy-related costs are recoverable in Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s fuel adjustment clause. In the event that the electric formula rate plan is not renewed or extended, Entergy Louisiana would revert to the more traditional rate case environment. 
Entergy New Orleans previously operated under a formula rate plan that ended with the 2011 test year. Currently, based on a settlement agreement approved by the City Council, with limited exceptions, no action may be taken with respect to Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s base rates until rates are implemented in connection with the most recent base rate case that is filed regarding its electric and gas operations. Entergy New Orleans filed its most recent rate case in September 2018 and expects a decision by the City Council later in 2019, with rates to become effective as of August 2019. 
The rates of System Energy are established by the FERC, and the costs allowed to be charged pursuant to these rates are, in turn, passed through to the participating Utility operating companies through the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which allows monthly adjustments to reflect the current operating costs of, and investment in, Grand Gulf. The Unit Power Sales Agreement is currently the subject of several litigation proceedings at the FERC, including a challenge with respect to System Energy&#8217;s authorized return on equity and capital structure. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the proceedings. 
The Utility operating companies and System Energy, and the energy industry as a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments, and an upward trend in spending, especially with respect to infrastructure investments, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future and could result in more frequent rate cases and requests for, and the continuation of, cost recovery mechanisms. For information regarding rate case proceedings and formula rate plans applicable to the Utility operating companies, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 
The Utility operating companies recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or disallowance in regulatory proceedings. 
The Utility operating companies recover their fuel, purchased power, and associated costs from their customers through rate mechanisms subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. Because regulatory review can result in the disallowance of incurred costs found not to have been prudently incurred, including the cost of replacement power purchased when generators experience outages, with the possibility of refunds to ratepayers, there exists some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulators may also initiate proceedings to investigate the continued usage or the adequacy and operation of the fuel and purchased power recovery clauses of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, there can be no assurance that existing recovery mechanisms will remain unchanged or in effect at all. 
The Utility operating companies&#8217; cash flows can be negatively affected by the time delays between when gas, power, or other commodities are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers of the costs in rates. On occasion, when the level of incurred costs for fuel and purchased power rises very dramatically, some of the Utility operating 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
companies may agree to defer recovery of a portion of that period&#8217;s fuel and purchased power costs for recovery at a later date, which could increase the near-term working capital and borrowing requirements of those companies. For a description of fuel and purchased power recovery mechanisms and information regarding the regulatory proceedings for fuel and purchased power costs recovery, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 
There remains uncertainty regarding the effect of the termination of the System Agreement on the Utility operating companies. 
The Utility operating companies historically engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating resources and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which is a rate schedule that had been approved by the FERC. The System Agreement terminated in its entirety on August 31, 2016. 
There remains uncertainty regarding the long-term effect of the termination of the System Agreement on the Utility operating companies because of the significant effect of the agreement on the generation and transmission functions of the Utility operating companies and the significant period of time (over 30 years) that it had been in existence. In the absence of the System Agreement, there remains uncertainty around the effectiveness of governance processes and the potential absence of federal authority to resolve certain issues among the Utility operating companies and their retail regulators. 
In addition, although the System Agreement terminated in its entirety in August 2016, there are a number of outstanding System Agreement proceedings at the FERC that may require future adjustments, including challenges to the level and timing of payments made by Entergy Arkansas under the System Agreement. The outcome and timing of these FERC proceedings and resulting recovery and impact on rates cannot be predicted at this time. 
For further information regarding the regulatory proceedings relating to the System Agreement, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 
The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the MISO markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs. The operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system pursuant to the MISO RTO tariff and their participation in the MISO RTO&#8217;s wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 
On December 19, 2013, the Utility operating companies integrated into the MISO RTO. MISO maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and administers wholesale energy and ancillary services markets for market participants in the MISO region, including the Utility operating companies. The Utility operating companies sell capacity, energy, and ancillary services on a bilateral basis to certain wholesale customers and offer available electricity production of their generating facilities into the MISO day-ahead and real-time energy markets pursuant to the MISO tariff and market rules. The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the MISO markets. MISO tariff rules and system conditions, including transmission congestion, could affect the Utility operating companies&#8217; ability to sell power in certain regions and/or the economic value of such sales, and MISO market rules may change in ways that cause additional risk. 
The Utility operating companies participate in the MISO regional transmission planning process and are subject to risks associated with planning decisions that MISO makes in the exercise of control over the planning of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission assets that are under MISO&#8217;s functional control. The Utility operating companies pay transmission rates that reflect the cost of transmission projects that the Utility operating companies do not own, which could increase cash or financing needs. MISO is currently evaluating through its stakeholder process potential changes in the transmission project criteria in MISO. These changes, if adopted, could potentially result in a larger volume of competitively bid and regionally cost allocated transmission projects. In addition to the cash and financing-related risks arising from the potential additional cost allocation to the Utility operating companies from these projects, there is a risk that the Utility operating companies&#8217; business and financial position could be harmed as a result of lost investment opportunities and other effects that flow from an increased number of competitive projects being approved 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
and constructed that are interconnected with their transmission systems. Further, the terms and conditions of the MISO tariff, including provisions related to the design and implementation of wholesale markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs, are subject to regulation by the FERC. The operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system pursuant to the MISO tariff and their participation in the MISO wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. In addition, orders from each of the Utility operating companies&#8217; respective retail regulators generally require that the Utility operating companies make periodic filings setting forth the results of analysis of the costs and benefits realized from MISO membership as well as the projected costs and benefits of continued membership in MISO and/or requesting approval of their continued membership in MISO. These filings have been submitted periodically by each of the Utility operating companies as required by their respective retail regulators, and the outcome of the resulting proceedings may affect the Utility operating companies&#8217; continued membership in MISO. 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 
A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred as a result of severe weather could have material effects on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather. 
Entergy&#8217;s and its Utility operating companies&#8217; results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition can be materially affected by the destructive effects of severe weather. Severe weather can also result in significant outages for the customers of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, reduced revenues for the Utility operating companies during the period of the outages. A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred or revenues lost as a result of severe weather could have a material effect on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather. 
Nuclear Operating, Shutdown and Regulatory Risks 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy) 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities must consistently operate their nuclear power plants at high capacity factors in order to be successful, and lower capacity factors could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Nuclear capacity factors significantly affect the results of operations of certain Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. Nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs. Consequently, to be successful, a plant owner must consistently operate its nuclear power plants at high capacity factors, consistent with safety requirements. For the Utility operating companies that own nuclear plants, lower capacity factors can increase production costs by requiring the affected companies to generate additional energy, sometimes at higher costs, from their fossil facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy their supply needs. For the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants, lower capacity factors directly affect revenues and cash flow from operations. Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; forward sales are comprised of various hedge products, many of which have some degree of operational-contingent price risk. Certain unit-contingent contracts guarantee specified minimum capacity factors. In the event plants with these contracts were operating below the guaranteed capacity factors, Entergy would be subject to price risk for the undelivered power. Further, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear forward sales contracts can also be on a firm LD basis, which subjects Entergy to increasing price risk as capacity factors decrease. Many of these firm hedge products have damages risk. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners periodically shut down their nuclear power plants to replenish fuel. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such refueling outages. If refueling outages last longer than anticipated or if unplanned outages arise, Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Outages at nuclear power plants to replenish fuel require the plant to be &#8220;turned off.&#8221; Refueling outages generally are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months and average approximately 30 days in duration. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such planned outages, which often extends the planned outage duration. When refueling outages last longer than anticipated or a plant experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease and maintenance costs may increase. Lower than forecasted capacity factors may cause Entergy Wholesale Commodities to experience reduced revenues and may also create damages risk with certain hedge products as previously discussed. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities face risks related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication). These risks could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
Based upon currently planned fuel cycles, Entergy&#8217;s nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what Entergy believes are reasonably predictable prices through 2019 and beyond. The nuclear fuel supply portfolio for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment is being adjusted to reflect reduced overall requirements related to the planned permanent shutdown of the Palisades, Pilgrim, Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 plants over the next three years . &#32;&#32;Entergy&#8217;s ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners. While there are a number of possible alternate suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, the pricing of any such alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time. Entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S. Market prices for nuclear fuel have been extremely volatile from time to time in the past, and may be subject to increased volatility due to the imposition of tariffs or shifting trade arrangements between countries. Although Entergy&#8217;s nuclear fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against market risks for several years, costs for nuclear fuel in the future cannot be predicted with certainty due to normal inherent market uncertainties, and price changes could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
Entergy&#8217;s ability to assure nuclear fuel supply also depends upon the performance and reliability of conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services providers. These service providers are fewer in number than uranium suppliers. For conversion and enrichment services, Entergy diversifies its supply by supplier and country and may take special measures to ensure a reliable supply of enriched uranium for fabrication into nuclear fuel. For fabrication services, each plant is dependent upon the performance of the fabricator of that plant&#8217;s nuclear fuel; therefore, Entergy relies upon additional monitoring, inspection, and oversight of the fabrication process to assure reliability and quality of its nuclear fuel. Certain of the suppliers and service providers are located in or dependent upon countries, such as Russia, in which deteriorating economic conditions or international sanctions could restrict the ability of such suppliers to continue to supply fuel or provide such services. The inability of such suppliers or service providers to perform such obligations could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business face the risk that the NRC will change or modify its regulations, suspend, or revoke their licenses, or increase oversight of their nuclear plants, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Under the Atomic Energy Act and Energy Reorganization Act, the NRC regulates the operation of nuclear power plants. The NRC may modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, related regulations, or the terms of the licenses for nuclear facilities. Interested parties may also intervene which could result in prolonged proceedings. A change in the Atomic Energy Act, other applicable statutes, or the applicable regulations or licenses, or the NRC&#8217;s interpretation thereof, may require 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and could materially affect the results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition of Entergy (through Entergy Wholesale Commodities), its Utility operating companies, or System Energy. A change in the classification of a plant owned by one of these companies under the NRC&#8217;s Reactor Oversight Process, which is the NRC&#8217;s program to collect information about plant performance, assess the information for its safety significance, and provide for appropriate licensee and NRC response, also could cause the owner of the plant to incur material additional costs as a result of the increased oversight activity and potential response costs associated with the change in classification. &#32;&#32; For additional information concerning the current classification of the plants owned by Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see &#8220; Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business &#32; - Regulation of the Nuclear Power Industry &#32;- NRC Reactor Oversight Process &#8221; in Part I, Item 1 and Note 8 to the financial statements. 
Events at nuclear plants owned by one of these companies, as well as those owned by others, may lead to a change in laws or regulations or the terms of the applicable licenses, or the NRC&#8217;s interpretation thereof, or may cause the NRC to increase oversight activity or initiate actions to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility, or impose civil penalties. As a result, if an incident were to occur at any nuclear generating unit, whether an Entergy nuclear generating unit or not, it could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities are exposed to risks and costs related to operating and maintaining their nuclear power plants, and their failure to maintain operational efficiency at their nuclear power plants could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
The nuclear generating units owned by certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, &#160; and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business began commercial operations in the 1970s-1980s. Older equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating safely and efficiently. This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages, or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in increased costs, some of which costs may not be fully recoverable by the Utility operating companies and System Energy in regulatory proceedings should there be a determination of imprudence. Operations at any of the nuclear generating units owned and operated by Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries could degrade to the point where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. If this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. A decision may be made to close a unit rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the unit to full capacity. For the Utility operating companies and System Energy, this could result in certain costs being stranded and potentially not fully recoverable in regulatory proceedings. For Entergy Wholesale Commodities, this could result in lost revenue and increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments and penalties for failure to perform under their contracts with customers. In addition, the operation and maintenance of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear facilities require the commitment of substantial human resources that can result in increased costs. 
The nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to the effects of stress corrosion cracking and other corrosion mechanisms on certain materials within plant systems. The issue is applicable at all nuclear units to varying degrees and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines that include in-service examinations, replacements, and mitigation strategies. Developments in the industry or identification of issues at the nuclear units could require unanticipated remediation efforts that cannot be quantified in advance. 
Moreover, Entergy is becoming more dependent on fewer suppliers for key parts of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants that may need to be replaced or refurbished, and in some cases, parts are no longer available and have to be reverse-engineered for replacement. In addition, certain major parts have long lead-times to manufacture if an unplanned replacement is needed. This dependence on a reduced number of suppliers and long lead-times on certain major parts for unplanned replacements could result in delays in obtaining qualified replacement parts and, therefore, greater expense for Entergy. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
The costs associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, as well as the costs of and their ability to fully decommission their nuclear power plants, could be significantly affected by the timing of the opening of a spent nuclear fuel disposal facility, as well as interim storage and transportation requirements. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants incur costs for the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. The approval of a license for a national repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, such as the one proposed for Yucca Mountain, Nevada, or any interim storage facility, and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. For example, while the DOE is required by law to proceed with the licensing of Yucca Mountain and, after the license is granted by the NRC, to construct the repository and commence the receipt of spent fuel, the NRC licensing of the Yucca Mountain repository is effectively at a standstill. These actions are prolonging the time before spent fuel is removed from Entergy&#8217;s plant sites. Because the DOE has not accomplished its objectives, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts, and Entergy has sued the DOE for such breach. Furthermore, Entergy is uncertain as to when the DOE will commence acceptance of spent fuel from its facilities for storage or disposal. As a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at the companies&#8217; nuclear sites and maintenance costs on existing storage facilities, including aging management of fuel storage casks, may increase. The costs of on-site storage are also affected by regulatory requirements for such storage. In addition, the availability of a repository or other off-site storage facility for spent nuclear fuel may affect the ability to fully decommission the nuclear units and the costs relating to decommissioning. For further information regarding spent fuel storage, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32;&#8211; Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#32;&#8211; Spent Fuel Disposal &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 8 to the financial statements. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to pay substantial retrospective premiums imposed under the Price-Anderson Act in the event of a nuclear incident, and losses not covered by insurance could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. 
Accidents and other unforeseen problems at nuclear power plants have occurred both in the United States and elsewhere. The Price-Anderson Act limits each reactor owner&#8217;s public liability (off-site) for a single nuclear incident to the payment of retrospective premiums into a secondary insurance pool, which is referred to as Secondary Financial Protection, up to approximately $137.6 million per reactor. With 99 reactors currently participating, this translates to a total public liability cap of approximately $14 billion per incident. The limit is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation, a change in the primary limit of insurance coverage, and changes in the number of licensed reactors. As required by the Price-Anderson Act, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities carry the maximum available amount of primary nuclear off-site liability insurance with American Nuclear Insurers, which is $450 million for each operating site. Claims for any nuclear incident exceeding that amount are covered under Secondary Financial Protection. As a result, in the event of a nuclear incident that causes damages (off-site) in excess of the primary insurance coverage, each owner of a nuclear plant reactor, including Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident, will be required to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the primary insurance level, up to a maximum of approximately $137.6 million per reactor per incident (Entergy&#8217;s maximum total contingent obligation per incident is $1.238 billion). The retrospective premium payment is currently limited to approximately $21 million per year per incident per reactor until the aggregate public liability for each licensee is paid up to the $137.6 million cap. 
NEIL is a utility industry mutual insurance company, owned by its members, including the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants. All member plants could be subject to an annual assessment (retrospective premium of up to 10 times current annual premium for all policies) should the NEIL surplus (reserve) be significantly depleted due to &#160; insured losses. As of December 31, 2018, the maximum annual assessment amounts total $118 million for the Utility plants. Retrospective premium insurance 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
available through NEIL&#8217;s reinsurance treaty can cover the potential assessments and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants currently maintain the retrospective premium insurance to cover those potential assessments. 
As an owner of nuclear power plants, Entergy participates in industry self-insurance programs and could be liable to fund claims should a plant owned by a different company experience a major event. Any resulting liability from a nuclear accident may exceed the applicable primary insurance coverage and require contribution of additional funds through the industry-wide program that could significantly affect the results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries. 
The decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants owned by the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may not be adequate to meet decommissioning obligations if market performance and other changes decrease the value of assets in the decommissioning trusts, if one or more of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants is retired earlier than the anticipated shutdown date, if the plants cost more to decommission than estimated, or if current regulatory requirements change, which then could require significant additional funding. 
Owners of nuclear generating plants have an obligation to decommission those plants. Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants maintain decommissioning trust funds for this purpose. Certain of the Utility operating companies collect funds from their customers, which are deposited into the trusts covering the units operated for or on behalf of those companies. Those rate collections, as adjusted from time to time by rate regulators, are generally based upon operating license lives and trust fund balances as well as estimated trust fund earnings and decommissioning costs. Assets in these trust funds are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns that may fall below projected return rates, and may result in losses resulting from the recognition of impairments of the value of certain securities held in these trust funds. 
Under NRC regulations, nuclear plant owners are permitted to project the NRC-required decommissioning amount, based on an NRC formula or a site-specific estimate, and the amount that will be available in each nuclear power plant&#8217;s decommissioning trusts combined with any other decommissioning financial assurances in place. The projections are made based on the operating license expiration date and the mid-point of the subsequent decommissioning process, or the anticipated actual completion of decommissioning if a site-specific estimate is used. If the projected amount of each individual plant&#8217;s decommissioning trusts exceeds the NRC-required decommissioning amount, then its decommissioning obligations are considered to be funded in accordance with NRC regulations. If the projected costs do not sufficiently reflect the actual costs required to decommission these nuclear power plants, or funding is otherwise inadequate, or if the formula, formula inputs, or site-specific estimate is changed to require increased funding, additional resources or commitments would be required. Furthermore, depending upon the level of funding available in the trust funds, the NRC may not permit the trust funds to be used to pay for related costs such as the management of spent nuclear fuel that are not included in the NRC&#8217;s formula. The NRC may also require a plan for the provision of separate funding for spent fuel management costs. In addition to NRC requirements, there are other decommissioning-related obligations for certain of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, which management believes it will be able to satisfy. 
Further, federal or state regulatory changes, including mandated increases in decommissioning funding or changes in the methods or standards for decommissioning operations, may also increase the funding requirements of, or accelerate the timing for funding of, the obligations related to the decommissioning of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants or may restrict the decommissioning-related costs that can be paid from the decommissioning trusts. As a result, under any of these circumstances, Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially affected. 
An early plant shutdown (either generally or relative to current expectations), poor investment results or higher than anticipated decommissioning costs (including as a result of changing regulatory requirements) could cause trust fund assets to be insufficient to meet the decommissioning obligations, with the result that the Utility operating 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
companies, System Energy or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to provide significant additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning, which, with respect to the Utility operating companies, may not be recoverable from customers in a timely fashion or at all. 
For further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, management&#8217;s decision to exit the merchant power business, the impairment charges that resulted from such decision, and the planned sales of Pilgrim and Palisades (which will include the transfer of each entity&#8217;s decommissioning trust), see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32; - Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, the &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power Business &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries, and Notes 9 and 14 to the financial statements. 
Changes in NRC regulations or other binding regulatory requirements may cause increased funding requirements for nuclear plant decommissioning trusts. 
NRC regulations require certain minimum financial assurance requirements for meeting obligations to decommission nuclear power plants. Those financial assurance requirements may change from time to time, and certain changes may result in a material increase in the financial assurance required for decommissioning the Utility operating companies&#8217;, System Energy&#8217;s, and owners of Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants. Such changes could result in the need for additional contributions to decommissioning trusts, or the posting of parent guarantees, letters of credit, or other surety mechanisms. For further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32; &#8211; Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 9 to the financial statements. 
New or existing safety concerns regarding operating nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel could lead to restrictions upon the operation and decommissioning of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants. 
New and existing concerns are being expressed in public forums about the safety of nuclear generating units and nuclear fuel, in particular in the northern United States, which is where most of the current fleet of Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants is located. These concerns have led to, and may continue to lead to, various proposals to Federal regulators and governing bodies in some localities where Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries own nuclear generating units for legislative and regulatory changes that might lead to the shutdown of nuclear units, additional requirements or restrictions related to spent nuclear fuel on-site storage and eventual disposal, or other adverse effects on owning, operating and decommissioning nuclear generating units. Entergy vigorously responds to these concerns and proposals. If any of the existing proposals, or any proposals that may arise in the future with respect to legislative and regulatory changes, become effective, they could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
(Entergy Corporation) 
Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are exposed to price risk. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries do not have a regulator-authorized rate of return on their capital investments in non-utility businesses. As a result, the sale of capacity and energy from the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, unless otherwise contracted, is subject to the fluctuation of market power prices. In order to reduce future price risk to desired levels, Entergy Wholesale Commodities utilizes contracts that are unit-contingent and Firm LD and various products such as forward sales, options, and collars. As of December 31, 2018, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear power generation plants had sold forward 98% in 2019, 94% in 2020, 91% in 2021, and 66% in 2022 of its generation portfolio&#8217;s planned energy output, reflecting the planned shutdown or sale of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants by mid-2022. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Market conditions such as product cost, market liquidity, and other portfolio considerations influence the product and contractual mix. The obligations under unit-contingent agreements depend on a generating asset that is operating; if the generation asset is not operating, the seller generally is not liable for damages. For some unit-contingent obligations, however, there is also a guarantee of availability that provides for the payment to the power purchaser of contract damages, if incurred, in the event the unit owner fails to deliver power as a result of the failure of the specified generation unit to generate power at or above a specified availability threshold. Firm LD sales transactions may be exposed to substantial operational price risk, a portion of which may be capped through the use of risk management products, to the extent that the plants do not run as expected and market prices exceed contract prices. 
Market prices may fluctuate substantially, sometimes over relatively short periods of time, and at other times experience sustained increases or decreases. Demand for electricity and its fuel stock can fluctuate dramatically, creating periods of substantial under- or over-supply. During periods of over-supply, prices might be depressed. Also, from time to time there may be political pressure, or pressure from regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over wholesale and retail energy commodity and transportation rates, to impose price limitations, credit requirements, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address volatility and other issues in these markets. 
The effects of sustained low natural gas prices and power market structure challenges have resulted in lower market prices for electricity in the power regions where the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are located. In addition, currently the market design under which the plants operate does not adequately compensate merchant nuclear plants for their environmental and fuel diversity benefits in the region. These conditions were primary factors leading to Entergy&#8217;s decision to shut down (or sell) Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear power plants before the end of their operating licenses (or requested operating licenses for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3). 
The price that different counterparties offer for various products including forward sales is influenced both by market conditions as well as the contract terms such as damage provisions, credit support requirements, and the number of available counterparties interested in contracting for the desired forward period. Depending on differences between market factors at the time of contracting versus current conditions, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; contract portfolio may have average contract prices above or below current market prices, including at the expiration of the contracts, which may significantly affect Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. New hedges are generally layered into on a rolling forward basis, which tends to drive hedge over-performance to market in a falling price environment, and hedge underperformance to market in a rising price environment; however, hedge timing, product choice, and hedging costs will also affect these results. See the &#8220; Market and Credit Risk Sensitive Instruments &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries. Since Entergy Wholesale Commodities has announced the closure (or sale) of its nuclear plants, Entergy Wholesale Commodities may enter into fewer forward sales contracts for output from such plants. 
Among the factors that could affect market prices for electricity and fuel, all of which are beyond Entergy&#8217;s control to a significant degree, are: 
prevailing market prices for natural gas, uranium (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication), coal, oil, and other fuels used in electric generation plants, including associated transportation costs, and supplies of such commodities; 
seasonality and realized weather deviations compared to normalized weather forecasts; 
availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources and the requirements of a renewable portfolio standard; 
changes in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal and crude oil, and refined products; 
liquidity in the general wholesale electricity market, including the number of creditworthy counterparties available and interested in entering into forward sales agreements for Entergy&#8217;s full hedging term; 
the actions of external parties, such as the FERC and local independent system operators and other state or Federal energy regulatory bodies, that may impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in the energy markets; 
electricity transmission, competing generation or fuel transportation constraints, inoperability, or inefficiencies; 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
the general demand for electricity, which may be significantly affected by national and regional economic conditions; 
weather conditions affecting demand for electricity or availability of hydroelectric power or fuel supplies; 
the rate of growth in demand for electricity as a result of population changes, regional economic conditions, and the implementation of conservation programs or distributed generation; 
regulatory policies of state agencies that affect the willingness of Entergy Wholesale Commodities customers to enter into long-term contracts generally, and contracts for energy in particular; 
increases in supplies due to actions of current Entergy Wholesale Commodities competitors or new market entrants, including the development of new generation facilities, expansion of existing generation facilities, the disaggregation of vertically integrated utilities, and improvements in transmission that allow additional supply to reach Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear markets; 
union and labor relations; 
changes in Federal and state energy and environmental laws and regulations and other initiatives, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, including but not limited to, the price impacts of proposed emission controls; 
changes in law resulting from federal or state energy legislation or legislation subjecting energy derivatives used in hedging and risk management transactions to governmental regulation; and 
natural disasters, terrorist actions, wars, embargoes, and other catastrophic events. 
The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative, regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 
The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and local laws. Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability. 
Public utilities under the Federal Power Act are required to obtain FERC acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity. Each of the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants that generates electricity, as well as Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing, LLC, is a &#8220;public utility&#8221; under the Federal Power Act by virtue of making wholesale sales of electric energy and/or owning wholesale electric transmission facilities. The FERC has granted these generating and power marketing companies the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. The FERC&#8217;s orders that grant the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; generating and power marketing companies market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if the FERC subsequently determines that the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if any of its generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority and potential penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation. If the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; generating or power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain the FERC&#8217;s acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have an adverse effect on the rates the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business charges for power from its facilities. 
The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules imposed by the existing Independent System Operators. The Independent System Operators that oversee most of the wholesale power markets may impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps and other mechanisms, to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets. These types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on the profitability of the Entergy Wholesale 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Commodities business&#8217; generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets. Further, the New York Independent System Operator could determine that the timing of the shutdown of the Indian Point units could be inconsistent with its market power rules, and impose certain penalties that could affect Entergy Wholesale Commodities. For further information regarding federal, state and local laws and regulation applicable to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see the &#8220; Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business &#8221; section in Part I, Item 1. 
The regulatory environment applicable to the electric power industry is subject to changes as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. Entergy cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. In addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism, have raised claims that the competitive marketplace is not working because energy prices in wholesale markets exceed the marginal cost of operating nuclear power plants, and have made proposals to re-regulate the markets, impose a generation tax, or require divestitures by generating companies to reduce their market share. Other proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process, which could require material changes to business planning models. If competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, modified, discontinued, or delayed, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected. 
The power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to impairment charges in certain circumstances, which could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
Entergy reviews long-lived assets held in all of its business segments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of these assets is uncertain. Generally, the determination of recoverability is based on the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the operations of such assets. Projected net cash flows depend on the expected operating life of the assets, the future operating costs associated with the assets, the efficiency and availability of the assets and generating units, and the future market and price for energy and capacity over the remaining life of the assets. In particular, the assets of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to further impairment in connection with the closure or sale of its nuclear power plants. Moreover, prior to the closure or sale of these plants, the failure of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows, an unfavorable change in forecasted operating results or cash flows, a reduction in the expected remaining useful life of a unit, or a decline in observable industry market multiples could all result in potential additional impairment charges for the affected assets. 
If Entergy concludes that any of its nuclear power plants is unlikely to operate through its planned shutdown date, which conclusion would be based on a variety of factors, such a conclusion could result in a further impairment of part or all of the carrying value of the plant. Any impairment charge taken by Entergy with respect to its long-lived assets, including the power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, would likely be material in the quarter that the charge is taken and could otherwise have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. For further information regarding evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32;- Impairment of Long-lived Assets and Trust Fund Investments &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries and for further discussion of the impairment charges, see Note 14 to the financial statements.

Entergy and the Utility operating companies depend on access to the capital markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could make it more difficult to handle future contingencies such as natural disasters or substantial increases in gas and fuel prices. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and the cost of capital. 
Entergy&#8217;s business is capital intensive and dependent upon its ability to access capital at reasonable rates and other terms. At times there are also spikes in the price for natural gas and other commodities that increase the liquidity requirements of the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. In addition, Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather-related or unforeseen disaster similar to that experienced in Entergy&#8217;s service territory with Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in 2005, Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike in 2008, and Hurricane Isaac in 2012. The occurrence of one or more contingencies, including a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel or purchased power costs or storm restoration costs, higher than expected pension contributions, an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines, less cash flow from operations than expected, changes in regulation or governmental policy (including tax and trade policy), or other unknown events, could cause the financing needs of Entergy and its subsidiaries to increase. In addition, accessing the debt capital markets more frequently in these situations may result in an increase in leverage. Material leverage increases could negatively affect the credit ratings of Entergy and the Utility operating companies, which in turn could negatively affect access to the capital markets. 
The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively affect Entergy and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to maintain and to expand their businesses. Events beyond Entergy&#8217;s control may create uncertainty that could increase its cost of capital or impair its ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on its bank credit facilities. Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their credit facilities as they come up for renewal. Moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. If Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could impact their ability to grow their businesses, decrease earnings, significantly reduce financial flexibility and/or limit Entergy Corporation&#8217;s ability to sustain its current common stock dividend level. 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) 
A downgrade in Entergy Corporation &#8217; s or its subsidiaries &#8217; credit ratings could negatively affect Entergy Corporation &#8217; s and its subsidiaries &#8217; ability to access capital and/or could require Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries to post collateral, accelerate certain payments, or repay certain indebtedness. 
There are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for each of Entergy Corporation and the Registrant Subsidiaries, including each Registrant&#8217;s regulatory framework, ability to recover costs and earn returns, diversification and financial strength and liquidity. If one or more rating agencies downgrade Entergy Corporation&#8217;s, any of the Utility operating companies&#8217;, or System Energy&#8217;s ratings, particularly below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and cash or letter of credit collateral demands may be triggered by the terms of a number of commodity contracts, leases, and other agreements. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Most of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; large customers, suppliers, and counterparties require sufficient creditworthiness to enter into transactions. If Entergy Corporation&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; ratings decline, particularly below investment grade, or if certain counterparties believe Entergy Corporation or the Utility operating companies are losing creditworthiness and demand adequate assurance under fuel, gas, and purchased power contracts, the counterparties may require posting of collateral in cash or letters of credit, prepayment for fuel, gas or purchased power or accelerated payment, or counterparties may decline business with Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2018, based on power prices at that time, Entergy had liquidity exposure of $126 million under the guarantees in place supporting Entergy Wholesale Commodities transactions and $52 million of posted cash collateral. In the event of a decrease in Entergy Corporation&#8217;s credit rating to below investment grade, based on power prices as of December 31, 2018, Entergy would have been required to provide approximately $69 million of additional cash or letters of credit under some of the agreements. As of December 31, 2018, the liquidity exposure associated with Entergy Wholesale Commodities assurance requirements, including return of previously posted collateral from counterparties, would increase by $310 million for a $1 per MMBtu increase in gas prices in both the short- and long-term markets. 
Recent U.S. tax legislation may materially adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 
The recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 significantly changed the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, including taxation of U.S. corporations, by, among other things, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, and altering the expensing of capital expenditures. The legislation and interpretive guidance from the IRS are unclear in certain respects and will require further interpretations and implementing regulations by the IRS, as well as state tax authorities, and the legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase certain impacts of the legislation. 
As further described in Note 3 to the financial statements, Entergy recorded a reduction of certain of its net deferred income tax assets (including the value of its net operating loss carryforwards) and regulatory liabilities, resulting in a charge against earnings in the fourth quarter 2017 of $526 million, including a $34 million net-of-tax reduction of regulatory liabilities, and Entergy and the Utility operating companies recorded a reduction of approximately $3.7 billion on a consolidated basis in certain of its net deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding increase in net regulatory liabilities. As a result of amortization of accumulated deferred income taxes and payment of such amounts to customers in 2018, Entergy&#8217;s net regulatory liability for income taxes balance is $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2018. Depending on the outcome of IRS examinations or tax positions and elections that Entergy may make, Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries may be required to record additional charges or credits to income tax expense. Further, there may be other material effects resulting from the legislation that have not been identified. 
Entergy believes that interpretations and implementing regulations by the IRS, as well as potential amendments and technical corrections, could result in lessening the impacts of certain aspects of this legislation. If Entergy is unable to successfully pursue avenues to manage the effects of the new tax legislation, or if additional interpretations, regulations, amendments, or technical corrections exacerbate the effects of the legislation, the legislation could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 
For further information regarding the effects of the Act, see the &#8220; Income Tax Legislation &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy. Also, Note 3 to the financial statements contains additional discussion of the effect of the Act on 2017 and 2018 results of operations and financial position, the provisions of the Act, and the uncertainties associated with accounting for the Act, and Note 2 to the financial statements discusses the regulatory proceedings that have considered the effects of the Act. 
Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact Entergy&#8217;s, the Utility operating companies&#8217;, and System Energy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Entergy and its subsidiaries make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes. These judgments include provisions for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. Entergy and its subsidiaries also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. Changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by Entergy and its subsidiaries could negatively affect Entergy&#8217;s, the Utility operating companies&#8217;, and System Energy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. For further information regarding Entergy&#8217;s income taxes, see Note 3 to the financial statements. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to successfully complete strategic transactions, including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring or other strategic transactions, is subject to significant risks, including the risk that required regulatory or governmental approvals may not be obtained, risks relating to unknown or undisclosed problems or liabilities, and the risk that for these or other reasons, Entergy and its subsidiaries may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that they anticipate from such transactions. 
From time to time, Entergy and its subsidiaries have pursued and may continue to pursue strategic transactions including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring or other strategic transactions. For example, Entergy announced that on July 30, 2018, it entered into purchase and sale agreements with Holtec International to sell to a Holtec subsidiary (i) 100% of the equity interests in Entergy Nuclear Generation Company, the owner of the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station, and (ii) 100% of the equity interests in Entergy Nuclear Palisades, LLC, the owner of the Palisades Nuclear Power Plant and the Big Rock Point Site. In addition, as part of Entergy&#8217;s plan to exit the merchant power business, it plans to shut down its remaining merchant nuclear power plants by mid-2022. Last, as further described in the &#8220; Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, a significant portion of Entergy&#8217;s utility business over the next several years includes the construction and /or purchase of a variety of generating units. These transactions and plans are or may become subject to regulatory approval and other material conditions or contingencies. The failure to complete these transactions or plans or any future strategic transaction successfully or on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on Entergy&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations and the market&#8217;s perception of Entergy&#8217;s ability to execute its strategy. Further, these transactions, and any completed or future strategic transactions, involve substantial risks, including the following: 
the disposition of a business or asset may involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, transition service agreements, guarantees, indemnities, or other current or contingent financial obligations; 
Entergy may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner when it decides to sell an asset or a business, which could delay the accomplishment of its strategic objectives. Alternatively, Entergy may dispose of a business or asset at a price or on terms that are less than what it had anticipated, or with the exclusion of assets that must be divested or run off separately; 
the disposition of a business could result in impairments and related write-offs of the carrying values of the relevant assets; 
acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels; 
acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate; 
Entergy and/or its subsidiaries may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to them, that exceed their estimates, or for which their rights to indemnification from the seller are limited; 
the disposition of a business, including Entergy&#8217;s planned exit from the merchant power business, could divert management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns; 
Entergy and/or its subsidiaries may be unable to obtain the necessary regulatory or governmental approvals to close a transaction, such approvals may be granted subject to terms that are unacceptable 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
to them, or Entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve anticipated regulatory treatment of any such transaction or acquired business or assets; and 
Entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that they anticipate from the transaction, or such benefits may be delayed or may not occur at all. 
Entergy may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that it may encounter in acquiring or divesting a business, or engaging in other strategic transactions, which could have a material effect on its business. 
The construction of, and capital improvements to, power generation facilities involve substantial risks. Should construction or capital improvement efforts be unsuccessful, the financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies could be materially affected. 
Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; ability to complete construction of power generation facilities, or make other capital improvements, in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. These variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise and escalating costs for materials, labor, and environmental compliance. Delays in obtaining permits, shortages in materials and qualified labor, suppliers and contractors not performing as required under their contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, poor quality initial cost estimates from contractors, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel costs, or materials costs, downward changes in the economy, changes in law or regulation, including environmental compliance requirements, and other events beyond the control of the Utility operating companies or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost, and performance of these projects. If these projects or other capital improvements are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, Entergy and the Utility operating companies could incur additional costs and termination payments, or face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project. In addition, the Utility operating companies could be exposed to higher costs and market volatility, which could affect cash flow and cost recovery, should their respective regulators decline to approve the construction of new generation needed to meet the reliability needs of customers at the lowest reasonable cost. 
For further information regarding capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital in connection with the potential construction and/or purchase of additional generation supply sources within the Utility operating companies&#8217; service territory, and as to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see the &#8220; Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of the Registrant Subsidiaries. 
The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters. 
The businesses in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation by local, state, and federal authorities. These laws and regulations affect the manner in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business conduct their operations and make capital expenditures. These laws and regulations also affect how the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business manage air emissions, discharges to water, wetlands impacts, solid and hazardous waste storage and disposal, cooling and service water intake, the protection of threatened and endangered species, certain migratory birds and eagles, hazardous materials transportation, and similar matters. Federal, state, and local authorities continually revise these laws and regulations, and the laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and to the permitting and enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. Developing and implementing plans for facility compliance with these requirements can lead to capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures. Violations of these requirements can subject the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties&#8217; claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
permits or standards. In addition, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business potentially are subject to liability under these laws for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned or operated by the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. The Utility operating companies are currently involved in proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been released and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance. 
Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury, particulates, greenhouse gases, and other regulated air emissions from generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulation, controls and mitigation expenses. In addition, existing air regulations and programs promulgated by the EPA often are challenged legally, or are revised or withdrawn by the EPA, sometimes resulting in large-scale changes to anticipated regulatory regimes and the resulting need to shift course, both operationally and economically, depending on the nature of the changes. Risks relating to global climate change, initiatives to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions, and water availability issues are discussed below. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if Entergy and its subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, the operation of its facilities could be stopped or become subject to additional costs. For further information regarding environmental regulation and environmental matters, see the &#8220; Regulation of Entergy &#8217; s Business &#32; &#8211; Environmental Regulation &#8221; section of Part I, Item 1. 
The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs related to reliability standards. 
Entergy&#8217;s business is subject to extensive and mandatory reliability standards. Such standards, which are established by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), the SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC), and other regional enforcement entities, are approved by the FERC and frequently are reviewed, amended, and supplemented. Failure to comply with such standards could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of such standards. The standards, as well as the laws and regulations that govern them, are subject to judicial interpretation and to the enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. In addition to exposure to civil penalties and fines, the Utility operating companies have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to compliance with new and existing reliability standards, including costs associated with the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system and generation assets. In addition, the retail regulators of the Utility operating companies may seek to impose standards governing the reliable operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; distribution systems, including penalties if these standards are not met. The changes to the reliability standards applicable to the electric power industry are ongoing, and Entergy cannot predict the ultimate effect that the reliability standards will have on its Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities businesses.

Weather, economic conditions, technological developments, and other factors may have a material impact on electricity and gas usage and otherwise materially affect the Utility operating companies &#8217; results of operations. 
Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase electric cooling demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels in the winter tend to increase electric and gas heating demand and revenues. As a corollary, moderate temperatures in either season tend to decrease usage of energy and resulting revenues. Seasonal pricing differentials, coupled with higher consumption levels, typically cause the Utility operating companies to report higher revenues in the third quarter of the fiscal year than in the other quarters. Extreme weather conditions or storms, however, may stress the Utility operating companies&#8217; generation facilities and transmission and distribution 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on their ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. These extreme conditions could have a material effect on the Utility operating companies&#8217; financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
Entergy&#8217;s electricity sales volumes are affected by a number of factors, including economic conditions, weather, customer bill sizes (large bills tend to induce conservation), trends in energy efficiency, new technologies and self-generation alternatives, including the willingness and ability of large industrial customers to develop co-generation facilities that greatly reduce their demand from Entergy. Some of these factors are inherently cyclical or temporary in nature, such as the weather or economic conditions, and rarely have a long-lasting effect on Entergy&#8217;s operating results. Others, such as the increasing adoption of energy efficient appliances, new building codes, distributed energy resources, energy storage, demand side management and new technologies such as rooftop solar are having a more permanent effect of reducing sales growth rates from historical norms. As a result of these emerging efficiencies and technologies, the Utility operating companies may lose customers or experience lower usage per customer in the residential and commercial classes, and further advances have the potential to limit sales growth in the future. The Utility operating companies also may face competition from other companies offering products and services to Entergy&#8217;s customers based on new or emerging technologies. In addition, electricity sales to industrial customers, in particular, benefit from steady economic growth and favorable commodity prices; however, they are sensitive to changes in conditions in the markets in which its customers operate. Any negative change in any of these or other factors has the potential to result in slower sales growth or sales declines and increased bad debt expense, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
The effects of climate change and environmental and regulatory obligations intended to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions or increase renewable energy requirements or to place a price on greenhouse gas emissions could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. 
In an effort to address climate change concerns, some federal, state, and local authorities are calling for additional laws and regulations aimed at known or suspected causes of climate change. For example, in response to the United States Supreme Court&#8217;s 2007 decision holding that the EPA has authority to regulate emissions of CO 2 &#32;and other &#8220;greenhouse gases&#8221; under the Clean Air Act, the EPA, various environmental interest groups, and other organizations focused considerable attention on CO 2 &#32;emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. In 2010, the EPA promulgated its first regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from certain vehicles and from new and significantly modified stationary sources of emissions, including electric generating units. During 2012 and 2014, the EPA proposed CO 2 &#32;emission standards for new and existing sources. The EPA finalized these standards in 2015; however, in subsequent years the EPA has proposed to repeal and replace certain of those regulations. As examples of state action, in the Northeast, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative establishes a cap on CO 2 &#32;emissions from electric power plants and requires generators to purchase emission permits to cover their CO 2 &#32;emissions, and a similar program has been developed in California. The impact that continued changes in the governmental response to climate change risk will have on existing and pending environmental laws and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions is currently unclear. 
Developing and implementing plans for compliance with greenhouse gas emissions reduction or renewable energy requirements can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing facilities and proposed projects; moreover, long-term planning to meet environmental requirements can be negatively impacted and costs may increase to the extent laws and regulations change prior to full implementation. These requirements could, in turn, lead to changes in the planning or operations of balancing authorities or organized markets in areas where the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or Entergy Wholesale Commodities do business. Violations of such requirements may subject Entergy Wholesale Commodities and the Utility operating companies to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties&#8217; claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. To 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
the extent Entergy believes any of these costs are recoverable in rates, however, additional material rate increases for customers could be resisted by Entergy&#8217;s regulators and, in extreme cases, Entergy&#8217;s regulators might deny or defer timely recovery of these costs. Future changes in environmental regulation governing the emission of CO 2 &#32;and other greenhouse gases or mix of generation sources could make some of Entergy&#8217;s electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the difficulty that Entergy and its subsidiaries have with obtaining or maintaining required environmental regulatory approvals, which could also materially affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of Entergy and its subsidiaries. In addition, lawsuits have occurred or are reasonably expected against emitters of greenhouse gases alleging that these companies are liable for personal injuries and property damage caused by climate change. These lawsuits may seek injunctive relief, monetary compensation, and punitive damages. 
In addition to the regulatory and financial risks associated with climate change discussed above, potential physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level, wind and storm surge damages, wildfires, wetland and barrier island erosion, risks of flooding and changes in weather conditions, (such as increases in precipitation, drought, or changes in average temperatures), and potential increased impacts of extreme weather conditions or storms. Entergy subsidiaries own assets in, and serve, communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, storms, and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands. A significant portion of the nation&#8217;s oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by the physical impacts of climate change, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes. Entergy and its subsidiaries also face the risk that climate change could impact the availability and quality of water supply necessary for operations. 
These and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on the Entergy System&#8217;s ability to meet peak customer demand, more frequent and longer lasting outages, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. Also, to the extent that climate change adversely impacts the economic health of a region or results in energy conservation or demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and revenues. Such physical or operational risks could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217;, System Energy&#8217;s, and the Utility operating companies&#8217; financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
Continued and future availability and quality of water for cooling, process, and sanitary uses could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. 
Water is a vital natural resource that is also critical to the Utility operating companies&#8217;, System Energy&#8217;s, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; business operations. Entergy&#8217;s facilities use water for cooling, boiler make-up, sanitary uses, potable supply, and many other uses. Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies also own and/or operate hydroelectric facilities. Accordingly, water availability and quality are critical to Entergy&#8217;s business operations. Impacts to water availability or quality could negatively impact both operations and revenues. 
Entergy secures water through various mechanisms (ground water wells, surface waters intakes, municipal supply, etc.) and operates under the provisions and conditions set forth by the provider and/or regulatory authorities. Entergy also obtains and operates in substantial compliance with water discharge permits issued under various provisions of the Clean Water Act and/or state water pollution control provisions. Regulations and authorizations for both water intake and use and for waste discharge can become more stringent in times of water shortages, low flows in rivers, low lake levels, low groundwater aquifer volumes, and similar conditions. The increased use of water by industry, agriculture, and the population at large, population growth, and the potential impacts of climate change on water resources may cause water use restrictions that affect Entergy and its subsidiaries. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity prices, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
To manage near-term financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, Entergy and its subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, may enter into contracts to hedge portions of their purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements, and inventories of natural gas, uranium and its conversion and enrichment, coal, refined products, and other commodities, within established risk management guidelines. As part of this strategy, Entergy and its subsidiaries may utilize fixed- and variable-price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. However, Entergy and its subsidiaries normally cover only a portion of the exposure of their assets and positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. In addition, Entergy also elects to leave certain volumes during certain years unhedged. To the extent Entergy and its subsidiaries have unhedged positions, fluctuating commodity prices can materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations and financial position. 
Although Entergy and its subsidiaries devote a considerable effort to these risk management strategies, they cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these activities. As a result of these and other factors, Entergy and its subsidiaries cannot predict with precision the impact that risk management decisions may have on their business, results of operations, or financial position. 
Entergy&#8217;s over-the-counter financial derivatives are subject to rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that are designed to promote transparency, mitigate systemic risk and protect against market abuse. Entergy cannot predict the impact any proposed or not fully-implemented final rules will have on its ability to hedge its commodity price risk or on over-the-counter derivatives markets as a whole, but such rules and regulations could have a material effect on Entergy's risk exposure, as well as reduce market liquidity and further increase the cost of hedging activities. 
Entergy has guaranteed or indemnified the performance of a portion of the obligations relating to hedging and risk management activities. Reductions in Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; credit quality or changes in the market prices of energy commodities could increase the cash or letter of credit collateral required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management activities, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity and financial position. 
The Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations, which may materially affect the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
The hedging and risk management practices of the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe Entergy and its subsidiaries money, energy, or other commodities will not perform their obligations. Currently, some hedging agreements contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure all or part of their obligations to Entergy or its subsidiaries. If the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, Entergy or its subsidiaries may enforce and recover the proceeds from the credit support provided and acquire alternative hedging arrangements, which credit support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. In such event, Entergy and its subsidiaries might incur losses in addition to amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. In addition, the credit commitments of Entergy&#8217;s lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such lenders, which could materially affect the adequacy of its liquidity sources. 
Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require additional funding and result in increased benefit plan costs. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under Entergy&#8217;s pension and postretirement benefit plans. A decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements relating to Entergy&#8217;s benefit plan liabilities and also result in higher benefit costs. As the value of the assets decreases, the &#8220;expected return on assets&#8221; component of benefit costs decreases, resulting in higher benefits costs. Additionally, asset losses are incorporated into benefit costs over time, thus increasing benefits costs. Volatility in the capital markets has affected the market value of these assets, which may affect Entergy&#8217;s planned levels of contributions in the future. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Entergy&#8217;s pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding and recognition of higher liability carrying costs. The funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans can also increase as a result of changes in, among other factors, retirement rates, life expectancy assumptions, or Federal regulations. For further information regarding Entergy&#8217;s pension and other postretirement benefit plans, refer to the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32; &#8211; Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of its Registrant Subsidiaries and Note 11 to the financial statements. 
The litigation environment in the states in which certain Entergy subsidiaries operate poses a significant risk to those businesses. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, asbestos, hazardous material and ratepayer matters, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters. The states in which the Utility operating companies operate, in particular Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, have proven to be unusually litigious environments. Judges and juries in these states have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort cases. Entergy and its subsidiaries use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against them, but the litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk. 
Domestic or international terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, and failures or breaches of Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; or their suppliers&#8217; technology systems may adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s results of operations. 
As an operator of critical infrastructure, Entergy and its subsidiaries face heightened risk of an act or threat of terrorism and cyber attacks, by domestic or foreign actors, whether as a direct act against one of Entergy&#8217;s generation, transmission or distribution facilities, or operations centers, or infrastructure and information technology systems used to manage, monitor, and transport power to customers and perform day-to-day business functions. In addition, Entergy has increased its use of and reliance on the Internet in connection with its initiatives, including smart-grid-related projects. The Internet is inherently vulnerable and subject to disability or failure due to malicious activity, viruses, and other types of security events that would heighten the risk of a cyber attack. An actual act could affect Entergy&#8217;s ability to operate, including its ability to operate the information technology systems and network infrastructure on which it relies to conduct its business. While malware was discovered on Entergy&#8217;s business network in 2018, and was remediated on a timely basis, it did not affect Entergy&#8217;s operational systems, generation plants (including nuclear), or transmission and distribution networks, nor did it have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s business operations. Additionally, within Entergy&#8217;s industry, there have been attacks on energy infrastructure. Although it appears that the impact of such attacks on operations has been minimal to date, there may be more attacks in the future and the impact of such attacks may be significant. This risk may be enhanced by the efforts of cyber actors associated with governments that have carried out campaigns of cyber-enabled theft targeting global technology service providers and their customers. The Utility operating companies also face heightened risk of an act or threat by cyber criminals intent on accessing personal information for the purpose of committing identity theft, taking company-sensitive data, or disrupting their ability to operate. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure in accordance with mandatory and prescriptive reliability and security standards. Despite the implementation of multiple layers of security by Entergy and its subsidiaries, technology systems remain vulnerable to potential existing and new threats that could lead to 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
unauthorized access to or loss of availability of critical systems essential to the reliable operation of Entergy&#8217;s electric system. Moreover, the functionality of Entergy&#8217;s technology systems depends on both its and third-party systems to which Entergy is connected directly or indirectly (such as systems belonging to suppliers, vendors and contractors, including cloud-service providers supporting business operations). While Entergy has processes in place to assess systems of certain of these suppliers, vendors and contractors, Entergy does not ultimately control the adequacy of their defenses against cyber and other attacks, but has implemented oversight measures to assess maturity and manage third-party risk. If Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; technology systems were compromised and unable to detect or recover in a timely fashion to a normal state of operations, Entergy or its subsidiaries may be unable to perform critical business functions that are essential to the company&#8217;s well-being and the health, safety, and security needs of its customers. In addition, an attack on its information technology infrastructure may result in a loss of its confidential, sensitive, and proprietary information, including personal information of its customers, employees, vendors, and others in Entergy&#8217;s care. 
Any such attacks, failures or breaches could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation. Insurance may not be adequate to cover losses that might arise in connection with these events. The risk of such attacks, failures, or breaches may cause Entergy and the Utility operating companies to incur increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for its power generation, transmission, and distribution assets and other facilities, such as additional physical facility security and security personnel, and for systems to protect its information technology and network infrastructure systems. Such events may also expose Entergy to an increased risk of litigation (and associated damages and fines). 
(Entergy New Orleans) 
The effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers taking gas service may adversely affect Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s results of operations and liquidity. 
Gas rates charged to retail gas customers are comprised primarily of purchased gas cost charges, which provide no return or profit to Entergy New Orleans, and distribution charges, which provide a return or profit to the utility. Distribution charges are affected by the amount of gas sold to customers. Purchased gas cost charges, which comprise most of a customer&#8217;s bill and may be adjusted monthly, represent gas commodity costs that Entergy New Orleans recovers from its customers. Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s cash flows can be affected by differences between the time period when gas is purchased and the time when ultimate recovery from customers occurs. When purchased gas cost charges increase substantially reflecting higher gas procurement costs incurred by Entergy New Orleans, customer usage may decrease, especially in weaker economic times, resulting in lower distribution charges for Entergy New Orleans, which could adversely affect results of operations. 
(System Energy) 
System Energy owns and, through an affiliate, operates a single nuclear generating facility, and it is dependent on affiliated companies for all of its revenues. 
System Energy&#8217;s operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% ownership/leasehold interest in Grand Gulf. Charges under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are paid by the Utility operating companies as consideration for their respective entitlements to receive capacity and energy. The useful economic life of Grand Gulf is finite and is limited by the terms of its operating license, which expires in November 2044. System Energy&#8217;s financial condition depends both on the receipt of payments from the Utility operating companies under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and on the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf. The Unit Power Sales Agreement is currently the subject of several litigation proceedings at the FERC, including a challenge with respect to System Energy&#8217;s authorized return on equity and capital structure. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the proceedings. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
For information regarding the Unit Power Sales Agreement, the sale and leaseback transactions and certain other agreements relating to the Entergy System companies&#8217; support of System Energy (including the Capital Funds Agreement), see Notes 8 and 10 to the financial statements and the &#8220; Utility &#32;- System Energy and Related Agreements &#8221; section of Part I, Item 1. 
(Entergy Corporation) 
As a holding company, Entergy Corporation depends on cash distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock. 
Entergy Corporation is a holding company with no material revenue generating operations of its own or material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, all of its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. Entergy Corporation&#8217;s ability to satisfy its financial obligations, including the payment of interest and principal on its outstanding debt, and to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the payment to it of dividends or distributions by its subsidiaries. The payments of dividends or distributions to Entergy Corporation by its subsidiaries in turn depend on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings, and on any applicable legal, regulatory, or contractual limitations on subsidiaries&#8217; ability to pay such dividends or distributions. Provisions in the articles of incorporation of certain of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s subsidiaries restrict the payment of cash dividends to Entergy Corporation. For further information regarding dividend or distribution restrictions to Entergy Corporation, see Note 7 to the financial statements.

RISK FACTORS 
Investors should review carefully the following risk factors and the other information in this Form 10-K. The risks that Entergy faces are not limited to those in this section. There may be additional risks and uncertainties (either currently unknown or not currently believed to be material) that could adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. See &#8220; FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION .&#8221; 
Utility Regulatory Risks 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) 
The terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the Utility operating companies and System Energy are determined through regulatory approval proceedings that can be lengthy and subject to appeal that could result in delays in effecting rate changes and uncertainty as to ultimate results. 
The rates that the Utility operating companies and System Energy charge reflect their capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, allowed rates of return, financing costs, and related costs of service. These rates significantly influence the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and each of the Utility operating companies and System Energy. These rates are determined in regulatory proceedings and are subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment, including adjustment upon the initiative of a regulator or affected stakeholders. 
In addition, regulators may initiate proceedings to investigate the prudence of costs in the Utility operating companies&#8217; base rates and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of the companies&#8217; operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures (including storm costs and costs associated with capital projects), allowed rates of return and rate base, proposed resource acquisitions, and previously incurred capital expenditures that the operating companies seek to place in rates. The regulators may disallow costs subject to their jurisdiction found not to have been prudently incurred or found not to have been incurred in compliance with applicable tariffs, creating some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or reduce rates. Traditional base rate proceedings, as opposed to formula rate plans, generally have long timelines, are primarily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited in scope or duration by statute. The length of these base rate proceedings can cause the Utility operating companies and System Energy to experience regulatory lag in recovering costs through rates. Decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings. 
The base rates of Entergy Texas are established largely in traditional base rate case proceedings. Apart from base rate proceedings, Entergy Texas has also filed to use rate riders to recover the revenue requirements associated with certain authorized historical costs. For example, Entergy Texas has recovered distribution-related capital investments through the distribution cost recovery factor rider mechanism, transmission-related capital investments and certain non-fuel MISO charges through the transmission cost recovery factor rider mechanism, and MISO fuel and energy-related costs through the fixed fuel factor mechanism. Entergy Texas is also required to make a filing every three years, at a minimum, reconciling its fuel and purchased power costs and fuel factor revenues. In the course of this reconciliation, the PUCT determines whether eligible fuel and fuel-related expenses and revenues are necessary and reasonable, and makes a prudence finding for each of the fuel-related contracts for the reconciliation period. 
Between base rate cases, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi are able to adjust base rates annually through formula rate plans that utilize a forward test year (Entergy Arkansas) or forward-looking features (Entergy Mississippi). In response to Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s application for a general change in rates in 2015, the APSC approved the formula rate plan tariff proposed by Entergy Arkansas including its use of a projected year test period and an initial five-year term. The initial five-year term expires in 2021 unless Entergy Arkansas requests, and the APSC approves, the extension of the formula rate plan tariff for an additional five years through 2026. In the event that Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s formula rate plan is terminated or is not extended beyond the initial term, Entergy Arkansas could file an 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
application for a general change in rates that may include a request for continued regulation under a formula rate review mechanism. If Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s formula rate plan is terminated, it would revert to the more traditional rate case environment or seek approval of a new formula rate plan. Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi recover fuel and purchased energy and certain non-fuel costs through other APSC-approved and MPSC-approved tariffs, respectively. 
Entergy Louisiana historically sets electric base rates annually through a formula rate plan using an historic test year. The form of the formula rate plan, on a combined basis, was approved in connection with the business combination of Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and largely followed the formula rate plans that were approved by the LPSC in connection with the full electric base rate cases filed by those companies in February 2013. The formula rate plan was approved for continued use through the test year 2016 filing and included a cap in cost of service increases at a cumulative total of $30 million through the formula rate plan cycle, which cap was not reached. The LPSC also approved in the business combination Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s continuation of a mechanism to recover non-fuel MISO-related costs, which are calculated separately from the formula rate plan requirements, but embedded in the formula rate plan factor applied on customer bills. This recovery mechanism expired following the 2015 test year, but was renewed for the 2016 test year. MISO fuel and energy-related costs are recoverable in Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s fuel adjustment clause. The formula rate plan includes exceptions from the rate cap and sharing requirements for certain large capital investment projects, including acquisition or construction of generating facilities, as well as purchase power agreements approved by the LPSC, among other items. In August 2017, Entergy Louisiana filed to extend the formula rate plan for an additional three years and to reset rates to the authorized mid-point return on equity of 9.95%. The filing also seeks certain modifications to the formula rate plan, including a narrower, 80 basis points earnings sharing bandwidth and implementation of a rider to recover certain transmission-related investments, when those investments begin delivering benefits to customers. In the event that the electric formula rate plan is not renewed or extended, Entergy Louisiana would revert to the more traditional rate case environment. 
Entergy New Orleans previously operated under a formula rate plan that ended with the 2011 test year. Currently, based on a settlement agreement approved by the City Council, with limited exceptions, no action may be taken with respect to Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s base rates until rates are implemented from a base rate case that must be filed for its electric and gas operations in 2018. The limited exceptions include implementation of the final year of a four-year phased-in rate increase for its Algiers operations in the Fifteenth Ward of the City of New Orleans and certain exceptional cost increases or decreases in its base revenue requirement. 
The rates of System Energy are established by the FERC, and the costs allowed to be charged pursuant to these rates are, in turn, passed through to the participating Utility operating companies through the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which allows monthly adjustments to reflect the current operating costs of, and investment in, Grand Gulf. 
The Utility operating companies and System Energy, and the energy industry as a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments, and an upward trend in spending, especially with respect to infrastructure investments, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future and could result in more frequent rate cases and requests for, and the continuation of, cost recovery mechanisms. For information regarding rate case proceedings and formula rate plans applicable to the Utility operating companies, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 
The Utility operating companies recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or disallowance in regulatory proceedings. 
The Utility operating companies recover their fuel, purchased power, and associated costs from their customers through rate mechanisms subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. Because regulatory review can result in the disallowance of incurred costs found not to have been prudently incurred, including the cost of replacement power purchased when generators experience outages, with the possibility of refunds to ratepayers, there exists some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulators may also initiate proceedings to investigate the continued usage or the adequacy and operation of the fuel and purchased power recovery clauses of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, there can be no assurance that existing recovery mechanisms will remain unchanged or in effect at all. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
The Utility operating companies&#8217; cash flows can be negatively affected by the time delays between when gas, power, or other commodities are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers of the costs in rates. On occasion, when the level of incurred costs for fuel and purchased power rises very dramatically, some of the Utility operating companies may agree to defer recovery of a portion of that period&#8217;s fuel and purchased power costs for recovery at a later date, which could increase the near-term working capital and borrowing requirements of those companies. For a description of fuel and purchased power recovery mechanisms and information regarding the regulatory proceedings for fuel and purchased power costs recovery, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 
There remains uncertainty regarding the effect of the termination of the System Agreement on the Utility operating companies. 
The Utility operating companies historically have engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating resources and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which is a rate schedule that had been approved by the FERC. The System Agreement terminated in its entirety on August 31, 2016. 
There remains uncertainty regarding the long-term effect of the termination of the System Agreement on the Utility operating companies because of the significant effect of the agreement on the generation and transmission functions of the Utility operating companies and the significant period of time (over 30 years) that it had been in existence. In the absence of the System Agreement, there remains uncertainty around the effectiveness of governance processes and the potential absence of federal authority to resolve certain issues among the Utility operating companies and their retail regulators. 
In addition, although the System Agreement terminated in its entirety in August 2016, there are a number of outstanding System Agreement proceedings at the FERC that may require future adjustments, including challenges to the level and timing of payments made by Entergy Arkansas under the System Agreement. The outcome and timing of these FERC proceedings and resulting recovery and impact on rates cannot be predicted at this time. 
For further information regarding the regulatory proceedings relating to the System Agreement, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 
The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the MISO markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs. The operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system pursuant to the MISO RTO tariff and their participation in the MISO RTO&#8217;s wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 
On December 19, 2013, the Utility operating companies integrated into the MISO RTO. MISO maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and administers wholesale energy and ancillary services markets for market participants in the MISO region, including the Utility operating companies. The Utility operating companies sell capacity, energy, and ancillary services on a bilateral basis to certain wholesale customers and offer available electricity production of their generating facilities into the MISO day-ahead and real-time energy markets pursuant to the MISO tariff and market rules. The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the MISO markets. MISO tariff rules and system conditions, including transmission congestion, could affect the Utility operating companies&#8217; ability to sell power in certain regions and/or the economic value of such sales, and MISO market rules may change in ways that cause additional risk. 
The Utility operating companies participate in the MISO regional transmission planning process and are subject to risks associated with planning decisions that MISO makes in the exercise of control over the planning of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission assets that are under MISO&#8217;s functional control. The Utility operating companies pay transmission rates that reflect the cost of transmission projects that the Utility operating companies do not own, which could increase cash or financing needs. MISO is currently evaluating through its stakeholder process potential changes in the transmission project criteria in MISO. These changes, if adopted, could potentially result in a larger 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
volume of competitively bid and regionally cost allocated transmission projects. In addition to the cash and financing-related risks arising from the potential additional cost allocation to the Utility operating companies from these projects, there is a risk that the Utility operating companies&#8217; business and financial position could be harmed as a result of lost investment opportunities and other effects that flow from an increased number of competitive projects being approved and constructed that are interconnected with their transmission systems. Further, the terms and conditions of the MISO tariff, including provisions related to the design and implementation of wholesale markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs, are subject to regulation by the FERC. The operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system pursuant to the MISO tariff and their participation in the MISO wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. In addition, orders from each of the Utility operating companies&#8217; respective retail regulators generally require that the Utility operating companies make periodic filings setting forth the results of analysis of the costs and benefits realized from MISO membership as well as the projected costs and benefits of continued membership in MISO and/or requesting approval of their continued membership in MISO. These filings have been submitted periodically by each of the Utility operating companies as required by their respective retail regulators, and the outcome of the resulting proceedings may affect the Utility operating companies&#8217; continued membership in MISO. 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 
A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred as a result of severe weather could have material effects on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather. 
Entergy&#8217;s and its Utility operating companies&#8217; results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition can be materially affected by the destructive effects of severe weather. Severe weather can also result in significant outages for the customers of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, reduced revenues for the Utility operating companies during the period of the outages. A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred or revenues lost as a result of severe weather could have a material effect on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather. 
Nuclear Operating, Shutdown and Regulatory Risks 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy) 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities must consistently operate their nuclear power plants at high capacity factors in order to be successful, and lower capacity factors could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Nuclear capacity factors significantly affect the results of operations of certain Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. Nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs. Consequently, to be successful, a plant owner must consistently operate its nuclear power plants at high capacity factors, consistent with safety requirements. For the Utility operating companies that own nuclear plants, lower capacity factors can increase production costs by requiring the affected companies to generate additional energy, sometimes at higher costs, from their fossil facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy their supply needs. For the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants, lower capacity factors directly affect revenues and cash flow from operations. Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; forward sales are comprised of various hedge products, many of which have some degree of operational-contingent price risk. Certain unit-contingent contracts guarantee specified minimum capacity factors. In the event plants with these contracts were operating below the guaranteed capacity factors, Entergy would be subject to price risk for the undelivered power. Further, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear forward sales contracts can also be on a firm LD basis, which subjects Entergy to increasing price risk as capacity factors decrease. Many of these firm hedge products have damages risk, capped through the use of risk management products. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners periodically shut down their nuclear power plants to replenish fuel. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such refueling outages. If refueling outages last longer than anticipated or if unplanned outages arise, Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected. 
Outages at nuclear power plants to replenish fuel require the plant to be &#8220;turned off.&#8221; Refueling outages generally are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months and average approximately 30 days in duration. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such planned outages. When refueling outages last longer than anticipated or a plant experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease and maintenance costs may increase. Lower than forecasted capacity factors may cause Entergy Wholesale Commodities to experience reduced revenues and may also create damages risk with certain hedge products as previously discussed. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities face risks related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication). These risks could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
Based upon currently planned fuel cycles, Entergy&#8217;s nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what Entergy believes are reasonably predictable prices through most of 2018. The nuclear fuel supply portfolio for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment is being adjusted to reflect reduced overall requirements related to the planned permanent shutdown of the Palisades, Pilgrim, Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 plants over the next two to five years . &#32;&#32;Entergy&#8217;s ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners. While there are a number of possible alternate suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, the pricing of any such alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time. Entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S. Market prices for nuclear fuel have been extremely volatile from time to time in the past. Although Entergy&#8217;s nuclear fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against market risks for several years, costs for nuclear fuel in the future cannot be predicted with certainty due to normal inherent market uncertainties, and price changes could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
Entergy&#8217;s ability to assure nuclear fuel supply also depends upon the performance and reliability of conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services providers. These service providers are fewer in number than uranium suppliers. For conversion and enrichment services, Entergy diversifies its supply by supplier and country and may take special measures to ensure a reliable supply of enriched uranium for fabrication into nuclear fuel. For fabrication services, each plant is dependent upon the performance of the fabricator of that plant&#8217;s nuclear fuel; therefore, Entergy relies upon additional monitoring, inspection, and oversight of the fabrication process to assure reliability and quality of its nuclear fuel. Certain of the suppliers and service providers are located in or dependent upon countries, such as Russia, in which deteriorating economic conditions or international sanctions could restrict the ability of such suppliers to continue to supply fuel or provide such services. The inability of such suppliers or service providers to perform such obligations could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business face the risk that the NRC will change or modify its regulations, suspend, not renew, or revoke their licenses, or increase oversight of their nuclear plants, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Under the Atomic Energy Act and Energy Reorganization Act, the NRC regulates the operation of nuclear power plants. The NRC may modify, suspend, not renew, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, related regulations, or the terms of the licenses for 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
nuclear facilities. The license renewal process in some cases may be the subject of significant public debate and legislative review and scrutiny at the federal and, in some cases, state level, though the decision whether to renew is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the NRC. Interested parties may also intervene which could result in prolonged proceedings. A change in the Atomic Energy Act, other applicable statutes, or the applicable regulations or licenses, or the NRC&#8217;s interpretation thereof, may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and could materially affect the results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition of Entergy (through Entergy Wholesale Commodities), its Utility operating companies, or System Energy. A change in the classification of a plant owned by one of these companies under the NRC&#8217;s Reactor Oversight Process, which is the NRC&#8217;s program to collect information about plant performance, assess the information for its safety significance, and provide for appropriate licensee and NRC response, also could cause the owner of the plant to incur material additional costs as a result of the increased oversight activity and potential response costs associated with the change in classification. &#32;&#32; For additional information concerning the current classification of the plants owned by Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see &#8220; Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business &#32; - Regulation of the Nuclear Power Industry &#32;- NRC Reactor Oversight Process &#8221; in Part I, Item 1 and Note 8 to the financial statements. 
Events at nuclear plants owned by one of these companies, as well as those owned by others, may lead to a change in laws or regulations or the terms of the applicable licenses, or the NRC&#8217;s interpretation thereof, or may cause the NRC to increase oversight activity or initiate actions to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility, or impose civil penalties. As a result, if an incident were to occur at any nuclear generating unit, whether an Entergy nuclear generating unit or not, it could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities are exposed to risks and costs related to operating and maintaining their nuclear power plants, and their failure to maintain operational efficiency at their nuclear power plants could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
The nuclear generating units owned by certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, &#160; and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business began commercial operations in the 1970s-1980s. Older equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating safely and efficiently. This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages, or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in increased costs, some of which costs may not be fully recoverable by the Utility operating companies and System Energy in regulatory proceedings. Operations at any of the nuclear generating units owned and operated by Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries could degrade to the point where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. If this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. A decision may be made to close a unit rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the unit to full capacity. For the Utility operating companies and System Energy, this could result in certain costs being stranded and potentially not fully recoverable in regulatory proceedings. For Entergy Wholesale Commodities, this could result in lost revenue and increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments and penalties for failure to perform under their contracts with customers. In addition, the operation and maintenance of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear facilities require the commitment of substantial human resources that can result in increased costs. 
The nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to the effects of stress corrosion cracking and other corrosion mechanisms on certain materials within plant systems. The issue is applicable at all nuclear units to varying degrees and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines that include in-service examinations, replacements, and mitigation strategies. Developments in the industry or identification of issues at the nuclear units could require unanticipated remediation efforts that cannot be quantified in advance. 
Moreover, Entergy is becoming more dependent on fewer suppliers for key parts of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants that may need to be replaced or refurbished. In addition, certain major parts have long lead-times to manufacture 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
if an unplanned replacement is needed. This dependence on a reduced number of suppliers and long lead-times on certain major parts for unplanned replacements could result in delays in obtaining qualified replacement parts and, therefore, greater expense for Entergy. 
The costs associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, as well as the costs of and their ability to fully decommission their nuclear power plants, could be significantly affected by the timing of the opening of a spent nuclear fuel disposal facility, as well as interim storage and transportation requirements. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants incur costs for the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. The approval of a license for a national repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, such as the one proposed for Yucca Mountain, Nevada, or any interim storage facility, and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. For example, while the DOE is required by law to proceed with the licensing of Yucca Mountain and, after the license is granted by the NRC, to construct the repository and commence the receipt of spent fuel, the NRC licensing of the Yucca Mountain repository is effectively at a standstill. These actions are prolonging the time before spent fuel is removed from Entergy&#8217;s plant sites. Because the DOE has not accomplished its objectives, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts, and Entergy has sued the DOE for such breach. Furthermore, Entergy is uncertain as to when the DOE will commence acceptance of spent fuel from its facilities for storage or disposal. As a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at the companies&#8217; nuclear sites and maintenance costs on existing storage facilities, including aging management of fuel storage casks, may increase. The costs of on-site storage are also affected by regulatory requirements for such storage. In addition, the availability of a repository or other off-site storage facility for spent nuclear fuel may affect the ability to fully decommission the nuclear units and the costs relating to decommissioning. For further information regarding spent fuel storage, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32;&#8211; Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#32;&#8211; Spent Fuel Disposal &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 8 to the financial statements. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to pay substantial retrospective premiums imposed under the Price-Anderson Act in the event of a nuclear incident, and losses not covered by insurance could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. 
Accidents and other unforeseen problems at nuclear power plants have occurred both in the United States and elsewhere. The Price-Anderson Act limits each reactor owner&#8217;s public liability (off-site) for a single nuclear incident to the payment of retrospective premiums into a secondary insurance pool of up to approximately $127.3 million per reactor. With 102 reactors currently participating, this translates to a total public liability cap of approximately $13 billion per incident. The limit is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation, a change in the primary limit of insurance coverage, and changes in the number of licensed reactors. As required by the Price-Anderson Act, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities carry the maximum available amount of primary nuclear off-site liability insurance with American Nuclear Insurers (which is $450 million for each operating site as of January 1, 2018). Claims for any nuclear incident exceeding that amount are covered under the retrospective premiums paid into the secondary insurance pool. As a result, in the event of a nuclear incident that causes damages (off-site) in excess of the primary insurance coverage, each owner of a nuclear plant reactor, including Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident, will be required to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the primary insurance level, up to a maximum of approximately $127.3 million per reactor per incident (Entergy&#8217;s maximum total contingent obligation per incident is $1.146 billion). The retrospective premium payment is currently limited to approximately $19 million per year per incident per reactor until the aggregate public liability for each licensee is paid up to the $127.3 million cap.

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
NEIL is a utility industry mutual insurance company, owned by its members, including the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants. All member plants could be subject to an annual assessment (retrospective premium of up to 10 times current annual premium for all policies) should the surplus (reserve) be significantly depleted due to &#160; insured losses. As of December 31, 2017, the maximum annual assessment amounts total $112.2 million for the Utility plants. Retrospective premium insurance available through NEIL&#8217;s reinsurance treaty can cover the potential assessments and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants currently maintain the retrospective premium insurance to cover those potential assessments. 
As an owner of nuclear power plants, Entergy participates in industry self-insurance programs and could be liable to fund claims should a plant owned by a different company experience a major event. Any resulting liability from a nuclear accident may exceed the applicable primary insurance coverage and require contribution of additional funds through the industry-wide program that could significantly affect the results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries. 
The decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants owned by the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may not be adequate to meet decommissioning obligations if market performance and other changes decrease the value of assets in the decommissioning trusts, if one or more of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants is retired earlier than the anticipated shutdown date, if the plants cost more to decommission than estimated, or if current regulatory requirements change, which then could require significant additional funding. 
Owners of nuclear generating plants have an obligation to decommission those plants. Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants maintain decommissioning trust funds for this purpose. Certain of the Utility operating companies collect funds from their customers, which are deposited into the trusts covering the units operated for or on behalf of those companies. Those rate collections, as adjusted from time to time by rate regulators, are generally based upon operating license lives and trust fund balances as well as estimated trust fund earnings and decommissioning costs. Assets in these trust funds are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns that may fall below projected return rates, and may result in losses resulting from the recognition of impairments of the value of certain securities held in these trust funds. 
In connection with the acquisition of certain nuclear plants, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners acquired decommissioning trust funds that are funded in accordance with NRC regulations. Under NRC regulations, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear subsidiaries are permitted to project the NRC-required decommissioning amount, based on an NRC formula or a site-specific estimate, and the amount that will be available in each of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant&#8217;s decommissioning trusts combined with other decommissioning financial assurances in place. The projections are made based on the operating license expiration date and the mid-point of the subsequent decommissioning process, or the anticipated actual completion of decommissioning if a site-specific estimate is used, for each of these nuclear power plants. As a result, if the projected amount of individual plants&#8217; decommissioning trusts exceeds the NRC-required decommissioning amount, then its decommissioning obligations are considered to be funded in accordance with NRC regulations. If the projected costs do not sufficiently reflect the actual costs the applicable Entergy subsidiaries would be required to incur to decommission these nuclear power plants, or funding is otherwise inadequate, or if the formula, formula inputs, or site-specific estimate is changed to require increased funding, additional resources would be required. Furthermore, depending upon the level of funding available in the trust funds, the NRC may not permit the trust funds to be used to pay for related costs such as the management of spent nuclear fuel that are not included in the NRC&#8217;s formula. The NRC may also require a plan for the provision of separate funding for spent fuel management costs. In addition to NRC requirements, there are other decommissioning-related obligations for certain of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, which management believes it will be able to satisfy. 
Further, federal or state regulatory changes, including mandated increases in decommissioning funding or changes in the methods or standards for decommissioning operations, may also increase the funding requirements of, 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
or accelerate the timing for funding of, the obligations related to the decommissioning of Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants or may restrict the decommissioning-related costs that can be paid from the decommissioning trusts. As a result, under any of these circumstances, Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially affected. 
An early plant shutdown (either generally or relative to current expectations), poor investment results or higher than anticipated decommissioning costs (including as a result of changing regulatory requirements) could cause trust fund assets to be insufficient to meet the decommissioning obligations, with the result that the Utility operating companies, System Energy or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to provide significant additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning, which, with respect to the Utility operating companies, may not be recoverable from customers in a timely fashion or at all. 
For further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, management&#8217;s decision to exit the merchant power business and the impairment charges that resulted from such decision, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32; - Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy, the &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power Business &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries and Notes 9 and 14 to the financial statements. 
Changes in NRC regulations or other binding regulatory requirements may cause increased funding requirements for nuclear plant decommissioning trusts. 
NRC regulations require certain minimum financial assurance requirements for meeting obligations to decommission nuclear power plants. Those financial assurance requirements may change from time to time, and certain changes may result in a material increase in the financial assurance required for decommissioning the Utility operating companies&#8217;, System Energy&#8217;s, and owners of Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants. Such changes could result in the need for additional contributions to decommissioning trusts, or the posting of parent guarantees, letters of credit, or other surety mechanisms. For further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32; &#8211; Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 9 to the financial statements. 
New or existing safety concerns regarding operating nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel could lead to restrictions upon the operation and decommissioning of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants. 
New and existing concerns are being expressed in public forums about the safety of nuclear generating units and nuclear fuel, in particular in the northeastern United States, which is where most of the current fleet of Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants is located. These concerns have led to, and are expected to continue to lead to, various proposals to Federal regulators and governing bodies in some localities where Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries own nuclear generating units for legislative and regulatory changes that could lead to the shutdown of nuclear units, denial of license renewal applications, additional requirements or restrictions related to spent nuclear fuel on-site storage and eventual disposal, or other adverse effects on owning, operating and decommissioning nuclear generating units. Entergy vigorously responds to these concerns and proposals. If any of the existing proposals, or any proposals that may arise in the future with respect to legislative and regulatory changes, become effective, they could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
(Entergy Corporation) 
A failure to obtain renewed licenses or other approvals required for the continued operation of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; Indian Point nuclear power plants could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and could lead to an acceleration of the timing for the funding of decommissioning obligations. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
The license renewal and related processes for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; Indian Point nuclear power plants have been and may continue to be the subject of significant public debate and regulatory and legislative review and scrutiny at the federal and, in certain cases, state level. The original expiration date of the operating license for Indian Point 2 was September 2013 and the original expiration date of the operating license for Indian Point 3 was December 2015. Because these plants filed timely license renewal applications, the NRC&#8217;s rules provide that these plants may continue to operate under their existing operating licenses until their renewal applications have been finally determined. 
In January 2017, Entergy announced that it plans to shut down Indian Point 2 in 2020 and Indian Point 3 in 2021. The early and orderly shutdown is part of a settlement under which New York State has agreed to drop legal challenges and support renewal of the operating licenses for Indian Point. For additional discussion of the settlement agreement with New York State, see the &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities Authorizations to Operate Indian Point &#8221; in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis. 
If the NRC were to deny the applications for the renewal of operating licenses for the Indian Point nuclear power plants, or if Indian Point fails to obtain other approvals, Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected by loss of revenue and cash flow associated with the plant or plants until the proposed shutdown date, potential impairments of the carrying value of the plants, increased depreciation rates, and an accelerated need for decommissioning funds, which could require additional funding. In addition, Entergy may incur increased operating costs depending on any conditions that may be imposed in connection with license renewal. For further discussion regarding the license renewal processes for the Indian Point nuclear power plants, see the &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities Authorizations to Operate Indian Point &#8221; in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis. 
Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are exposed to price risk. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries do not have a regulator-authorized rate of return on their capital investments in non-utility businesses. As a result, the sale of capacity and energy from the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, unless otherwise contracted, is subject to the fluctuation of market power prices. In order to reduce future price risk to desired levels, Entergy Wholesale Commodities utilizes contracts that are unit-contingent and Firm LD and various products such as forward sales, options, and collars. As of December 31, 2017, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear power generation plants had sold forward 98% in 2018, 91% in 2019, 51% in 2020, 74% in 2021, and 67% in 2022 of its generation portfolio&#8217;s planned energy output, reflecting the planned shutdown or sale of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants by mid-2022. 
Market conditions such as product cost, market liquidity, and other portfolio considerations influence the product and contractual mix. The obligations under unit-contingent agreements depend on a generating asset that is operating; if the generation asset is not operating, the seller generally is not liable for damages. For some unit-contingent obligations, however, there is also a guarantee of availability that provides for the payment to the power purchaser of contract damages, if incurred, in the event the unit owner fails to deliver power as a result of the failure of the specified generation unit to generate power at or above a specified availability threshold. Firm LD sales transactions may be exposed to substantial operational price risk, a portion of which may be capped through the use of risk management products, to the extent that the plants do not run as expected and market prices exceed contract prices. 
Market prices may fluctuate substantially, sometimes over relatively short periods of time, and at other times experience sustained increases or decreases. Demand for electricity and its fuel stock can fluctuate dramatically, creating periods of substantial under- or over-supply. During periods of over-supply, prices might be depressed. Also, from time to time there may be political pressure, or pressure from regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over wholesale and retail energy commodity and transportation rates, to impose price limitations, credit requirements, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address volatility and other issues in these markets. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
The effects of sustained low natural gas prices and power market structure challenges have resulted in lower market prices for electricity in the power regions where the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are located. In addition, currently the market design under which the plants operate does not adequately compensate merchant nuclear plants for their environmental and fuel diversity benefits in the region. These conditions were primary factors leading to Entergy&#8217;s decision to shut down (or sell) Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear power plants before the end of their operating licenses (or requested operating licenses for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3). 
The price that different counterparties offer for various products including forward sales is influenced both by market conditions as well as the contract terms such as damage provisions, credit support requirements, and the number of available counterparties interested in contracting for the desired forward period. Depending on differences between market factors at the time of contracting versus current conditions, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; contract portfolio may have average contract prices above or below current market prices, including at the expiration of the contracts, which may significantly affect Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. New hedges are generally layered into on a rolling forward basis, which tends to drive hedge over-performance to market in a falling price environment, and hedge underperformance to market in a rising price environment; however, hedge timing, product choice, and hedging costs will also affect these results. See the &#8220; Market and Credit Risk Sensitive Instruments &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries. Since Entergy Wholesale Commodities has announced the closure (or sale) of its nuclear plants, Entergy Wholesale Commodities may enter into fewer forward sales contracts for output from such plants. 
Among the factors that could affect market prices for electricity and fuel, all of which are beyond Entergy&#8217;s control to a significant degree, are: 
prevailing market prices for natural gas, uranium (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication), coal, oil, and other fuels used in electric generation plants, including associated transportation costs, and supplies of such commodities; 
seasonality and realized weather deviations compared to normalized weather forecasts; 
availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources and the requirements of a renewable portfolio standard; 
changes in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal and crude oil, and refined products; 
liquidity in the general wholesale electricity market, including the number of creditworthy counterparties available and interested in entering into forward sales agreements for Entergy&#8217;s full hedging term; 
the actions of external parties, such as the FERC and local independent system operators and other state or Federal energy regulatory bodies, that may impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in the energy markets; 
electricity transmission, competing generation or fuel transportation constraints, inoperability, or inefficiencies; 
the general demand for electricity, which may be significantly affected by national and regional economic conditions; 
weather conditions affecting demand for electricity or availability of hydroelectric power or fuel supplies; 
the rate of growth in demand for electricity as a result of population changes, regional economic conditions, and the implementation of conservation programs or distributed generation; 
regulatory policies of state agencies that affect the willingness of Entergy Wholesale Commodities customers to enter into long-term contracts generally, and contracts for energy in particular; 
increases in supplies due to actions of current Entergy Wholesale Commodities competitors or new market entrants, including the development of new generation facilities, expansion of existing generation facilities, the disaggregation of vertically integrated utilities, and improvements in transmission that allow additional supply to reach Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear markets; 
union and labor relations; 
changes in Federal and state energy and environmental laws and regulations and other initiatives, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, including but not limited to, the price impacts of proposed emission controls; 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
changes in law resulting from federal or state energy legislation or legislation subjecting energy derivatives used in hedging and risk management transactions to governmental regulation; and 
natural disasters, terrorist actions, wars, embargoes, and other catastrophic events. 
The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative, regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 
The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to extensive regulation under federal, state, and local laws. Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability. 
Public utilities under the Federal Power Act are required to obtain FERC acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity. Each of the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants that generates electricity, as well as Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing, LLC, is a &#8220;public utility&#8221; under the Federal Power Act by virtue of making wholesale sales of electric energy and/or owning wholesale electric transmission facilities. The FERC has granted these generating and power marketing companies the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. The FERC&#8217;s orders that grant the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; generating and power marketing companies market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if the FERC subsequently determines that the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if any of its generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority and potential penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation. If the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; generating or power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain the FERC&#8217;s acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have an adverse effect on the rates the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business charges for power from its facilities. 
The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules imposed by the existing Independent System Operators. The Independent System Operators that oversee most of the wholesale power markets may impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps and other mechanisms, to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets. These types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on the profitability of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business&#8217; generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets. Further, the New York Independent System Operator could determine that the timing of the shutdown of the Indian Point units could be inconsistent with its market power rules, and impose certain penalties that could affect Entergy Wholesale Commodities. For further information regarding federal, state and local laws and regulation applicable to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see the &#8220; Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business &#8221; section in Part I, Item 1. 
The regulatory environment applicable to the electric power industry is subject to changes as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. Entergy cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. In addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism, have raised claims that the competitive marketplace is not working because energy prices in wholesale markets exceed the marginal cost of operating nuclear power plants, and have made proposals to re-regulate the markets, impose a generation tax, or require divestitures by generating companies to reduce their market share. Other proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process, which 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
could require material changes to business planning models. If competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, modified, discontinued, or delayed, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected. 
The power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to impairment charges in certain circumstances, which could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
Entergy reviews long-lived assets held in all of its business segments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of these assets is uncertain. Generally, the determination of recoverability is based on the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the operations of such assets. Projected net cash flows depend on the expected operating life of the assets, the future operating costs associated with the assets, the efficiency and availability of the assets and generating units, and the future market and price for energy and capacity over the remaining life of the assets. In particular, the assets of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to further impairment in connection with the closure or sale of the plants discussed below. Moreover, prior to the closure or sale of these plants, the failure of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows, an unfavorable change in forecasted operating results or cash flows, a reduction in the expected remaining useful life of a unit (including if the operating licenses for the Indian Point power plants are not renewed by the NRC), or a decline in observable industry market multiples could all result in potential additional impairment charges for the affected assets. 
On August 27, 2013, Entergy announced its plan to close and decommission Vermont Yankee. Vermont Yankee ceased power production in the fourth quarter 2014 at the end of a fuel cycle. This decision was approved by the Board in August 2013, and resulted in the recognition of impairment charges in 2013 and 2014. In October 2015, Entergy determined that it will close the Pilgrim and FitzPatrick plants. The Pilgrim plant will cease operations no later than June 1, 2019. FitzPatrick was expected to shut down at the end of its current fuel cycle, planned for January 27, 2017, but in March 2017, Entergy sold the FitzPatrick plant to Exelon Generation Company, LLC which continues to operate the plant. During the third quarter 2015, Entergy recorded impairment and other related charges to write down the carrying values of the FitzPatrick and Pilgrim plants and related assets to their fair values. In addition, in the fourth quarter 2015, Entergy recorded impairment and other related charges to write down the carrying value of the Palisades plant and related assets to their fair value. In December 2016, Entergy reached an agreement with Consumers Energy to terminate the PPA for the Palisades plant and to shut down the plant in 2018, but the agreement was terminated in September 2017 after the Michigan Public Service Commission decided that Consumers Power could not recover costs incurred under the agreement. Entergy intends to shut down the Palisades plant permanently on May 31, 2022. In January 2017, Entergy announced that it reached a settlement with New York State and plans to close the Indian Point 2 plant in 2020 and the Indian Point 3 plant in 2021. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2016, Entergy recorded impairment and other related charges to write down the carrying values of the Palisades and Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 plants and related assets to their fair value. In addition to the impairments and other related charges, Entergy has incurred severance and employee retention costs and expects to incur additional charges through 2022 relating to the decisions to shut down Vermont Yankee, Palisades, Pilgrim, Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3, and the sale of FitzPatrick. 
If Entergy concludes that any of its nuclear power plants is unlikely to operate through its planned shutdown date, which conclusion would be based on a variety of factors, such a conclusion could result in a further impairment of part or all of the carrying value of the plant. Any impairment charge taken by Entergy with respect to its long-lived assets, including the power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, would likely be material in the quarter that the charge is taken and could otherwise have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. For further information regarding evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32;- Impairment of Long-lived Assets and Trust Fund Investments &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries and for further discussion of the impairment charges, see Note 14 to the financial statements.

General Business 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 
Entergy and the Utility operating companies depend on access to the capital markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could make it more difficult to handle future contingencies such as natural disasters or substantial increases in gas and fuel prices. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and the cost of capital. 
Entergy&#8217;s business is capital intensive and dependent upon its ability to access capital at reasonable rates and other terms. At times there are also spikes in the price for natural gas and other commodities that increase the liquidity requirements of the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. In addition, Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather-related or unforeseen disaster similar to that experienced in Entergy&#8217;s service territory with Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in 2005, Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike in 2008, and Hurricane Isaac in 2012. The occurrence of one or more contingencies, including a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel or purchased power costs or storm restoration costs, higher than expected pension contributions, an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines, less cash flow from operations than expected, or other unknown events, could cause the financing needs of Entergy and its subsidiaries to increase. In addition, accessing the debt capital markets more frequently in these situations may result in an increase in leverage. Material leverage increases could negatively affect the credit ratings of Entergy and the Utility operating companies, which in turn could negatively affect access to the capital markets. 
The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively affect Entergy and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to maintain and to expand their businesses. Events beyond Entergy&#8217;s control may create uncertainty that could increase its cost of capital or impair its ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on its bank credit facilities. Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their credit facilities as they come up for renewal. Moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. If Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could impact their ability to grow their businesses, decrease earnings, significantly reduce financial flexibility and/or limit Entergy Corporation&#8217;s ability to sustain its current common stock dividend level. 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) 
A downgrade in Entergy Corporation &#8217; s or its subsidiaries &#8217; credit ratings could negatively affect Entergy Corporation &#8217; s and its subsidiaries &#8217; ability to access capital and/or could require Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries to post collateral, accelerate certain payments, or repay certain indebtedness. 
There are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for each of Entergy Corporation and the Registrant Subsidiaries, including each Registrant&#8217;s regulatory framework, ability to recover costs and earn returns, diversification and financial strength and liquidity. If one or more rating agencies downgrade Entergy Corporation&#8217;s, any of the Utility operating companies&#8217;, or System Energy&#8217;s ratings, particularly below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and cash or letter of credit collateral demands may be triggered by the terms of a number of commodity contracts, leases, and other agreements. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Most of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; large customers, suppliers, and counterparties require sufficient creditworthiness to enter into transactions. If Entergy Corporation&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; ratings decline, particularly below investment grade, or if certain counterparties believe Entergy Corporation or the Utility operating companies are losing creditworthiness and demand adequate assurance under fuel, gas, and purchased power contracts, the counterparties may require posting of collateral in cash or letters of credit, prepayment for fuel, gas or purchased power or accelerated payment, or counterparties may decline business with Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2017, based on power prices at that time, Entergy had liquidity exposure of $167 million under the guarantees in place supporting Entergy Wholesale Commodities transactions and $8 million of posted cash collateral. In the event of a decrease in Entergy Corporation&#8217;s credit rating to below investment grade, based on power prices as of December 31, 2017, Entergy would have been required to provide approximately $98 million of additional cash or letters of credit under some of the agreements. In the event of a decrease in the credit ratings of Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies to below investment grade, those companies collectively could be required to provide up to $50 million of additional cash or letters of credit to MISO. As of December 31, 2017, the liquidity exposure associated with Entergy Wholesale Commodities assurance requirements, including return of previously received collateral from counterparties, would increase by $372 million for a $1 per MMBtu increase in gas prices in both the short- and long-term markets. 
Recent U.S. tax legislation may materially adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and credit ratings. 
The recently enacted H.R. 1, also known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, will significantly change the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, including taxation of U.S. corporations, by, among other things, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, and altering the expensing of capital expenditures. The legislation is unclear in certain respects and will require interpretations and implementing regulations by the IRS, as well as state tax authorities, and the legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase certain impacts of the legislation. In addition, the regulatory treatment of the impacts of this legislation, particularly on companies like Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries, will be subject to the discretion of federal, state, and local public utility regulators. 
As further described in Note 3 to the financial statements, Entergy recorded a reduction of certain of its net deferred income tax assets (including the value of its net operating loss carryforwards) and regulatory liabilities, resulting in a charge against earnings in the fourth quarter 2017 of $526 million, including a $34 million net-of-tax reduction of regulatory liabilities, and Entergy and the Utility operating companies recorded a reduction of approximately $3.7 billion on a consolidated basis in certain of its net deferred tax liabilities and a corresponding increase in net regulatory liabilities. Depending on the outcome of the ratemaking process, IRS examinations, or tax positions and elections that Entergy may elect, Entergy and the Registrant Subsidiaries may be required to record additional charges or credits to income tax expense. Further, the amount and timing of the return of the deferred taxes to customers is dependent upon the regulatory treatment received, and, if the Registrant Subsidiaries are unsuccessful in receiving balanced regulatory treatment, Entergy&#8217;s or the Utility operating companies&#8217; cash flow could be materially adversely affected. Further, there may be other material effects resulting from the legislation that have not been identified. While Entergy plans to finance its cash needs that result from the Act through a combination of Registrant Subsidiary debt and Entergy Corporation debt and equity, there can be no assurance that Entergy or the Registrant Subsidiaries will obtain debt or equity financing on terms that are satisfactory or consistent with their current expectations. 
In addition, while Moody&#8217;s changed the ratings outlooks for Entergy Corporation to negative from stable in reaction to the legislation, it is unclear when or how capital markets, other credit rating agencies, the FERC or state or local regulators may respond to this legislation. Entergy expects that certain financial metrics used by credit rating agencies will be negatively affected as a result of the return of excess deferred taxes to customers, increased debt, and the decrease in the Registrant Subsidiaries&#8217; revenue requirements, and related decrease in operating cash flows, expected as a consequence of the lower federal corporate income tax rate while, at the same time, the loss of the bonus depreciation tax deduction will increase taxable income in the future. Also, the timing of the return of excess deferred income taxes 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
to customers will not exactly match the lower taxes that Entergy will be paying which will result in cash outflows to customers. It is also uncertain how other credit rating agencies will treat the impacts of this legislation on their credit ratings and metrics, and whether additional avenues will evolve for companies to manage the adverse aspects of this legislation. These avenues, to the extent available and if successfully applied, could lessen the impacts on certain credit metrics, although there can be no assurance in this regard. 
Entergy believes that interpretations and implementing regulations by the IRS, as well as potential amendments and technical corrections, could result in lessening the impacts of certain aspects of this legislation. If Entergy is unable to successfully pursue avenues to manage the effects of the new tax legislation, or if additional interpretations, regulations, amendments, or technical corrections exacerbate the effects of the legislation, the legislation could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, and could result in additional credit rating agency actions. Any such actions by credit rating agencies may make it more difficult and costly for Entergy to issue debt securities and certain other types of financing and could increase borrowing costs under its credit facilities. 
For further information regarding the effects of the Act, see the &#8220; Income Tax Legislation &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy. Also, Note 3 to the financial statements contains additional discussion of the effect of the Act on 2017 results of operations and financial position, the provisions of the Act, and the uncertainties associated with accounting for the Act, and Note 2 to the financial statements discusses proceedings commenced or other responses by Entergy&#8217;s regulators to the Act. 
Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact Entergy&#8217;s, the Utility operating companies&#8217;, and System Energy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes. These judgments include provisions for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. Entergy and its subsidiaries also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. Changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by Entergy and its subsidiaries could negatively affect Entergy&#8217;s, the Utility operating companies&#8217;, and System Energy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. For further information regarding Entergy&#8217;s income taxes, see Note 3 to the financial statements. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to successfully complete strategic transactions, including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring or other strategic transactions, is subject to significant risks, including the risk that required regulatory or governmental approvals may not be obtained, risks relating to unknown or undisclosed problems or liabilities, and the risk that for these or other reasons, Entergy and its subsidiaries may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that they anticipate from such transactions. 
From time to time, Entergy and its subsidiaries have pursued and may continue to pursue strategic transactions including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring or other strategic transactions. For example, in November 2016, Entergy announced that it had entered into a purchase and sale agreement with NorthStar for the sale of 100% of the membership interests in Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee, which owns the Vermont Yankee plant. In addition, as part of Entergy&#8217;s plan to exit the merchant power business, it plans to shut down its remaining merchant nuclear power plants by mid-2022. These transactions and plans are or may become subject to regulatory approval and other material conditions or contingencies. The failure to complete these transactions or plans or any future strategic transaction successfully or on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on Entergy&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations and the market&#8217;s perception of Entergy&#8217;s ability to execute its strategy. Further, these transactions, and any completed or future strategic transactions, involve substantial risks, including the following: 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
the disposition of a business or asset may involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, transition service agreements, guarantees, indemnities, or other current or contingent financial obligations; 
Entergy may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner when it decides to sell an asset or a business, which could delay the accomplishment of its strategic objectives. Alternatively, Entergy may dispose of a business or asset at a price or on terms that are less than what it had anticipated, or with the exclusion of assets that must be divested or run off separately; 
the disposition of a business could result in impairments and related write-offs of the carrying values of the relevant assets; 
acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels; 
acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate; 
Entergy and/or its subsidiaries may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to them, that exceed their estimates, or for which their rights to indemnification from the seller are limited; 
the disposition of a business, including Entergy&#8217;s planned exit from the merchant power business, could divert management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns; 
Entergy and/or its subsidiaries may be unable to obtain the necessary regulatory or governmental approvals to close a transaction, such approvals may be granted subject to terms that are unacceptable to them, or Entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve anticipated regulatory treatment of any such transaction or acquired business or assets; and 
Entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that they anticipate from the transaction, or such benefits may be delayed or may not occur at all. 
Entergy may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that it may encounter in acquiring or divesting a business, or engaging in other strategic transactions, which could have a material effect on its business. 
The construction of, and capital improvements to, power generation facilities involve substantial risks. Should construction or capital improvement efforts be unsuccessful, the financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies could be materially affected. 
Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; ability to complete construction of power generation facilities, or make other capital improvements, in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. These variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise and escalating costs for materials, labor, and environmental compliance. Delays in obtaining permits, shortages in materials and qualified labor, suppliers and contractors not performing as required under their contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, poor quality initial cost estimates from contractors, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel costs, or materials costs, downward changes in the economy, changes in law or regulation, including environmental compliance requirements, and other events beyond the control of the Utility operating companies or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost, and performance of these projects. If these projects or other capital improvements are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, Entergy and the Utility operating companies could incur additional costs and termination payments, or face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project. In addition, the Utility operating companies could be exposed to higher costs and market volatility, which could affect cash flow and cost recovery, should their respective regulators decline to approve the construction of new generation needed to meet the reliability needs of customers at the lowest reasonable cost. 
For further information regarding capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital in connection with the potential construction of additional generation supply sources within the Utility operating companies&#8217; service territory, and as to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see the &#8220; Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of the Registrant Subsidiaries. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters. 
The businesses in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation by local, state, and federal authorities. These laws and regulations affect the manner in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business conduct their operations and make capital expenditures. These laws and regulations also affect how the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business manage air emissions, discharges to water, wetlands impacts, solid and hazardous waste storage and disposal, cooling and service water intake, the protection of threatened and endangered species, certain migratory birds and eagles, hazardous materials transportation, and similar matters. Federal, state, and local authorities continually revise these laws and regulations, and the laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and to the permitting and enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. Developing and implementing plans for facility compliance with these requirements can lead to capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures. Violations of these requirements can subject the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties&#8217; claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. In addition, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business potentially are subject to liability under these laws for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned or operated by the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. The Utility operating companies are currently involved in proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been released and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance. 
Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury, particulates, greenhouse gases, and other regulated air emissions from generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulation, controls and mitigation expenses. In addition, existing air regulations and programs promulgated by the EPA often are challenged legally, sometimes resulting in large-scale changes to anticipated regulatory regimes and the resulting need to shift course, both operationally and economically, depending on the nature of the changes. Risks relating to global climate change, initiatives to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions, and water availability issues are discussed below. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if Entergy and its subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, the operation of its facilities could be stopped or become subject to additional costs. For further information regarding environmental regulation and environmental matters, see the &#8220; Regulation of Entergy &#8217; s Business &#32; &#8211; Environmental Regulation &#8221; section of Part I, Item 1. 
The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs related to reliability standards. 
Entergy&#8217;s business is subject to extensive and mandatory reliability standards. Such standards, which are established by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), the SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC), and other regional enforcement entities, are approved by the FERC and frequently are reviewed, amended, and supplemented. Failure to comply with such standards could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of such standards. The standards, as well as the laws and regulations that govern them, are subject to judicial interpretation and to the enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. In addition to exposure to civil penalties and fines, the Utility operating companies have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to compliance with new and existing reliability standards, including costs associated with the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system and generation assets. The changes to the 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
reliability standards applicable to the electric power industry are ongoing, and Entergy cannot predict the ultimate effect that the reliability standards will have on its Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 
The effects of weather and economic conditions, and the related impact on electricity and gas usage, may materially affect the Utility operating companies &#8217; results of operations. 
Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase electric cooling demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels in the winter tend to increase electric and gas heating demand and revenues. As a corollary, moderate temperatures in either season tend to decrease usage of energy and resulting revenues. Seasonal pricing differentials, coupled with higher consumption levels, typically cause the Utility operating companies to report higher revenues in the third quarter of the fiscal year than in the other quarters. Extreme weather conditions or storms, however, may stress the Utility operating companies&#8217; generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on their ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. These extreme conditions could have a material effect on the Utility operating companies&#8217; financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
Entergy&#8217;s electricity sales volumes are affected by a number of factors, including economic conditions, weather, customer bill sizes (large bills tend to induce conservation), trends in energy efficiency, new technologies and self-generation alternatives, including the willingness and ability of large industrial customers to develop co-generation facilities that greatly reduce their demand from Entergy. Some of these factors are inherently cyclical or temporary in nature, such as the weather or economic conditions, and rarely have a long-lasting effect on Entergy&#8217;s operating results. Others, such as the increasing adoption of energy efficient appliances, new building codes, distributed energy resources, energy storage, demand side management and new technologies such as rooftop solar are having a more permanent effect of reducing sales growth rates from historical norms. As a result of these emerging efficiencies and technologies, the Utility operating companies may experience lower usage per customer in the residential and commercial classes, and further advances have the potential to limit sales growth in the future. Electricity sales to industrial customers, in particular, benefit from steady economic growth and favorable commodity prices; however, they are sensitive to changes in conditions in the markets in which its customers operate. Any negative change in any of these or other factors has the potential to result in slower sales growth or sales declines and increased bad debt expense, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
The effects of climate change and environmental and regulatory obligations intended to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions or to place a price on greenhouse gas emissions could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. 
In an effort to address climate change concerns, federal, state, and local authorities are calling for additional laws and regulations aimed at known or suspected causes of climate change. For example, in response to the United States Supreme Court&#8217;s 2007 decision holding that the EPA has authority to regulate emissions of CO 2 &#32;and other &#8220;greenhouse gases&#8221; under the Clean Air Act, the EPA, various environmental interest groups, and other organizations are focusing considerable attention on CO 2 &#32;emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. In 2010, the EPA promulgated its first regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from certain vehicles and from new and significantly modified stationary sources of emissions, including electric generating units. During 2012 and 2014, the EPA proposed CO 2 &#32;emission standards for new and existing sources. The EPA finalized these standards in 2015; however, in late 2017, the EPA proposed to repeal the regulations and issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for replacing certain aspects of the standards for existing sources. As examples of state action, in the Northeast, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative establishes a cap on CO 2 &#32;emissions from electric power plants and requires generators to purchase emission permits to cover their CO 2 &#32;emissions, and a similar program has been 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
developed in California. The impact that recent changes in the federal government will have on existing and pending environmental laws and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions is currently unclear. 
Developing and implementing plans for compliance with greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing facilities and proposed projects; moreover, long-term planning to meet environmental requirements can be negatively impacted and costs may increase to the extent laws and regulations change prior to full implementation. These requirements could, in turn, lead to changes in the planning or operations of balancing authorities or organized markets in areas where the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or Entergy Wholesale Commodities do business. Violations of such requirements may subject Entergy Wholesale Commodities and the Utility operating companies to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties&#8217; claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. To the extent Entergy believes any of these costs are recoverable in rates, however, additional material rate increases for customers could be resisted by Entergy&#8217;s regulators and, in extreme cases, Entergy&#8217;s regulators might deny or defer timely recovery of these costs. Future changes in environmental regulation governing the emission of CO 2 &#32;and other greenhouse gases could make some of Entergy&#8217;s electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the difficulty that Entergy and its subsidiaries have with obtaining or maintaining required environmental regulatory approvals, which could also materially affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of Entergy and its subsidiaries. In addition, lawsuits have occurred or are reasonably expected against emitters of greenhouse gases alleging that these companies are liable for personal injuries and property damage caused by climate change. These lawsuits may seek injunctive relief, monetary compensation, and punitive damages. 
In addition to the regulatory and financial risks associated with climate change discussed above, potential physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level, wind and storm surge damages, wetland and barrier island erosion, risks of flooding and changes in weather conditions, (such as increases in precipitation, drought, or changes in average temperatures), and potential increased impacts of extreme weather conditions or storms. Entergy subsidiaries own assets in, and serve, communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, storms, and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands. A significant portion of the nation&#8217;s oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by wetland and barrier island erosion, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes. Entergy and its subsidiaries also face the risk that climate change could impact the availability and quality of water supply necessary for operations. 
These and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on the Entergy System&#8217;s ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. Also, to the extent that climate change adversely impacts the economic health of a region or results in energy conservation or demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and revenues. Such physical or operational risks could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217;, System Energy&#8217;s, and the Utility operating companies&#8217; financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
Continued and future availability and quality of water for cooling, process, and sanitary uses could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. 
Water is a vital natural resource that is also critical to the Utility operating companies&#8217;, System Energy&#8217;s, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; business operations. Entergy&#8217;s facilities use water for cooling, boiler make-up, sanitary uses, potable supply, and many other uses. Three of Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies own and/or operate hydroelectric facilities. Accordingly, water availability and quality are critical to Entergy&#8217;s business operations. Impacts to water availability or quality could negatively impact both operations and revenues. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Entergy secures water through various mechanisms (ground water wells, surface waters intakes, municipal supply, etc.) and operates under the provisions and conditions set forth by the provider and/or regulatory authorities. Entergy also obtains and operates in substantial compliance with water discharge permits issued under various provisions of the Clean Water Act and/or state water pollution control provisions. Regulations and authorizations for both water intake and use and for waste discharge can become more stringent in times of water shortages, low flows in rivers, low lake levels, low groundwater aquifer volumes, and similar conditions. The increased use of water by industry, agriculture, and the population at large, population growth, and the potential impacts of climate change on water resources may cause water use restrictions that affect Entergy and its subsidiaries. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity prices, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
To manage near-term financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, Entergy and its subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, may enter into contracts to hedge portions of their purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements, and inventories of natural gas, uranium and its conversion and enrichment, coal, refined products, and other commodities, within established risk management guidelines. As part of this strategy, Entergy and its subsidiaries may utilize fixed- and variable-price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. However, Entergy and its subsidiaries normally cover only a portion of the exposure of their assets and positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. In addition, Entergy also elects to leave certain volumes during certain years unhedged. To the extent Entergy and its subsidiaries have unhedged positions, fluctuating commodity prices can materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations and financial position. 
Although Entergy and its subsidiaries devote a considerable effort to these risk management strategies, they cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these activities. As a result of these and other factors, Entergy and its subsidiaries cannot predict with precision the impact that risk management decisions may have on their business, results of operations, or financial position. 
Entergy&#8217;s over-the-counter financial derivatives are subject to rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that are designed to promote transparency, mitigate systemic risk and protect against market abuse. Entergy cannot predict the impact any proposed or not fully-implemented final rules will have on its ability to hedge its commodity price risk or on over-the-counter derivatives markets as a whole, but such rules and regulations could have a material effect on Entergy's risk exposure, as well as reduce market liquidity and further increase the cost of hedging activities. 
Entergy has guaranteed or indemnified the performance of a portion of the obligations relating to hedging and risk management activities. Reductions in Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; credit quality or changes in the market prices of energy commodities could increase the cash or letter of credit collateral required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management activities, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity and financial position. 
The Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations, which may materially affect the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
The hedging and risk management practices of the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe Entergy and its subsidiaries money, energy, or other commodities will not perform their obligations. Currently, some hedging agreements contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure all or part of their obligations to Entergy or its subsidiaries. If the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, Entergy or its subsidiaries may enforce and recover the proceeds from the credit support provided and acquire alternative hedging arrangements, which credit 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. In such event, Entergy and its subsidiaries might incur losses in addition to amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. In addition, the credit commitments of Entergy&#8217;s lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such lenders, which could materially affect the adequacy of its liquidity sources. 
Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require additional funding and result in increased benefit plan costs. 
The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under Entergy&#8217;s pension and postretirement benefit plans. A decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements relating to Entergy&#8217;s benefit plan liabilities and also result in higher benefit costs. As the value of the assets decreases, the &#8220;expected return on assets&#8221; component of benefit costs decreases, resulting in higher benefits costs. Additionally, asset losses are incorporated into benefit costs over time, thus increasing benefits costs. Volatility in the capital markets has affected the market value of these assets, which may affect Entergy&#8217;s planned levels of contributions in the future. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Entergy&#8217;s pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding and recognition of higher liability carrying costs. The funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans can also increase as a result of changes in, among other factors, retirement rates, life expectancy assumptions, or Federal regulations. For further information regarding Entergy&#8217;s pension and other postretirement benefit plans, refer to the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32; &#8211; Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of its Registrant Subsidiaries and Note 11 to the financial statements. 
The litigation environment in the states in which certain Entergy subsidiaries operate poses a significant risk to those businesses. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, asbestos, hazardous material and ratepayer matters, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters. The states in which the Utility operating companies operate, in particular Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, have proven to be unusually litigious environments. Judges and juries in these states have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort cases. Entergy and its subsidiaries use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against them, but the litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk. 
Domestic or international terrorist attacks, including cyber attacks, and failures or breaches of Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; technology systems may adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s results of operations. 
As power generators and distributors, Entergy and its subsidiaries face heightened risk of an act or threat of terrorism, including physical and cyber attacks, either as a direct act against one of Entergy&#8217;s generation facilities, transmission operations centers, or distribution infrastructure used to manage and transport power to customers. An actual act could affect Entergy&#8217;s ability to operate, including its ability to operate the information technology systems and network infrastructure on which it relies to conduct its business. While malware was recently discovered on our corporate network and remediated on a timely basis, it did not affect the company&#8217;s operational systems, nuclear plants or transmission network, nor did it have a material effect on our operations. Additionally, within Entergy&#8217;s industry, there have been attacks on energy infrastructure, but with minimal impact to operations, and there may be more attacks in the future. The Utility operating companies also face heightened risk of an act or threat by cyber criminals intent on accessing personal information for the purpose of committing identity theft, taking company-sensitive data, or disrupting the company&#8217;s ability to operate. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure in accordance with mandatory and prescriptive standards. Despite the implementation of multiple layers of security by Entergy and its subsidiaries, 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
technology systems remain vulnerable to potential threats that could lead to unauthorized access or loss of availability to critical systems essential to the reliable operation of Entergy&#8217;s electric system. Moreover, the functionality of Entergy&#8217;s technology systems depends on both its and third-party systems to which Entergy is connected directly or indirectly (such as systems belonging to suppliers, vendors and contractors). While Entergy has processes in place to assess systems of certain of these suppliers, vendors and contractors, Entergy does not ultimately control the adequacy of their defenses against cyber and other attacks, but has implemented oversight measures to assess maturity and manage third-party risk. If Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; technology systems were compromised and unable to detect or recover in a timely fashion to a normal state of operations, Entergy or its subsidiaries may be unable to perform critical business functions that are essential to the company&#8217;s well-being and the health, safety, and security needs of its customers. In addition, an attack on its information technology infrastructure may result in a loss of its confidential, sensitive, and proprietary information, including personal information of its customers, employees, vendors, and others in Entergy&#8217;s care. 
Any such attacks, failures or breaches could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation. Insurance may not be adequate to cover losses that might arise in connection with these events. The risk of such attacks, failures, or breaches may cause Entergy and the Utility operating companies to incur increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for its power generation, transmission, and distribution assets and other facilities, such as additional physical facility security and security personnel, and for systems to protect its information technology and network infrastructure systems. Such events may also expose Entergy to an increased risk of litigation (and associated damages and fines). 
(Entergy New Orleans) 
The effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers taking gas service may adversely affect Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s results of operations and liquidity. 
Gas rates charged to retail gas customers are comprised primarily of purchased gas cost charges, which provide no return or profit to Entergy New Orleans, and distribution charges, which provide a return or profit to the utility. Distribution charges are affected by the amount of gas sold to customers. Purchased gas cost charges, which comprise most of a customer&#8217;s bill and may be adjusted monthly, represent gas commodity costs that Entergy New Orleans recovers from its customers. Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s cash flows can be affected by differences between the time period when gas is purchased and the time when ultimate recovery from customers occurs. When purchased gas cost charges increase substantially reflecting higher gas procurement costs incurred by Entergy New Orleans, customer usage may decrease, especially in weaker economic times, resulting in lower distribution charges for Entergy New Orleans, which could adversely affect results of operations. 
(System Energy) 
System Energy owns and, through an affiliate, operates a single nuclear generating facility, and it is dependent on affiliated companies for all of its revenues. 
System Energy&#8217;s operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% ownership/leasehold interest in Grand Gulf. Charges under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are paid by the Utility operating companies as consideration for their respective entitlements to receive capacity and energy. The useful economic life of Grand Gulf is finite and is limited by the terms of its operating license, which expires in November 2044. System Energy&#8217;s financial condition depends both on the receipt of payments from the Utility operating companies under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and on the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf. 
For information regarding the Unit Power Sales Agreement, the sale and leaseback transactions and certain other agreements relating to the Entergy System companies&#8217; support of System Energy (including the Capital Funds

Agreement), see Notes 8 and 10 to the financial statements and the &#8220; Utility &#32;- System Energy and Related Agreements &#8221; section of Part I, Item 1. 
(Entergy Corporation) 
As a holding company, Entergy Corporation depends on cash distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock. 
Entergy Corporation is a holding company with no material revenue generating operations of its own or material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, all of its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. Entergy Corporation&#8217;s ability to satisfy its financial obligations, including the payment of interest and principal on its outstanding debt, and to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the payment to it of dividends or distributions by its subsidiaries. The payments of dividends or distributions to Entergy Corporation by its subsidiaries in turn depend on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings, and on any applicable legal, regulatory, or contractual limitations on subsidiaries&#8217; ability to pay such dividends or distributions. Provisions in the articles of incorporation of certain of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s subsidiaries restrict the payment of cash dividends to Entergy Corporation. For further information regarding dividend or distribution restrictions to Entergy Corporation, see Note 7 to the financial statements.

RISK FACTORS 
Investors should review carefully the following risk factors and the other information in this Form 10-K. The risks that Entergy faces are not limited to those in this section. There may be additional risks and uncertainties (either currently unknown or not currently believed to be material) that could adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. See &#8220; FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION .&#8221; 
Utility Regulatory Risks 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) 
The terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the Utility operating companies and System Energy are determined through regulatory approval proceedings that can be lengthy and subject to appeal that could result in delays in effecting rate changes and uncertainty as to ultimate results. 
The rates that the Utility operating companies and System Energy charge reflect their capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, allowed rates of return, financing costs, and related costs of service. These rates significantly influence the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and each of the Utility operating companies and System Energy. These rates are determined in regulatory proceedings and are subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment upon the initiative of a regulator or affected stakeholders. 
In addition, regulators can initiate proceedings to investigate the prudence of costs in the Utility operating companies&#8217; base rates and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of the companies&#8217; operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures (including storm costs and costs associated with capital projects), allowed rates of return and rate base, proposed resource acquisitions, and previously incurred capital expenditures that the operating companies seek to place in rates. The regulators can disallow costs subject to their jurisdiction found not to have been prudently incurred or found not to have been incurred in compliance with applicable tariffs, creating some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or reduce rates. Traditional base rate proceedings, as opposed to formula rate plans, generally have long timelines, are primarily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited in scope or duration by statute. The length of these base rate proceedings can cause the Utility operating companies and System Energy to experience regulatory lag in recovering costs through rates. Decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings. 
The base rates of Entergy Texas are established in traditional base rate case proceedings. Apart from base rate proceedings, Entergy Texas has also filed to use rate riders to recover the revenue requirements associated with certain authorized historical costs. Specifically, Entergy Texas has recovered distribution-related capital investments through the distribution cost recovery factor rider mechanism, transmission-related capital investments and certain non-fuel MISO charges through the transmission cost recovery factor rider mechanism, and MISO fuel and energy-related costs through the fixed fuel factor mechanism. Entergy Texas is also required to make a filing every three years, at a minimum, reconciling its fuel and purchased power costs and fuel factor revenues. In the course of this reconciliation, the PUCT determines whether eligible fuel and fuel-related expenses and revenues are necessary and reasonable, and makes a prudence finding for each of the fuel-related contracts for the reconciliation period. 
Between base rate cases, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi are able to adjust base rates annually through formula rate plans that utilize a forward test year (Entergy Arkansas) or forward-looking features (Entergy Mississippi). In response to Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s application for a general change in rates in 2015, the APSC approved Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s proposed formula rate plan rider pursuant to its election to have its rates regulated under a formula rate review mechanism pursuant to legislation enacted by the Arkansas General Assembly in early 2015. The APSC approved the formula rate plan tariff including its use of a projected year test period and an initial five-year term. The initial five-year term expires in 2021 unless Entergy Arkansas requests, and the APSC approves, the extension of the formula rate plan tariff for an additional five years through 2026. In the event that Entergy Arkansas&#8217; formula rate 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
plan is terminated or is not extended beyond the initial term, Entergy Arkansas could file an application for a general change in rates that may include a request for continued regulation under a formula rate review mechanism. If Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s formula rate plan is terminated, it would revert to the more traditional rate case environment or seek approval of a new formula rate plan. Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi recover fuel and purchased energy and certain non-fuel costs through other APSC-approved and MPSC-approved tariffs, respectively. 
Entergy Louisiana sets electric base rates annually through a formula rate plan using an historic test year. The form of the formula rate plan, on a combined basis, was approved in connection with the business combination of Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and largely followed the formula rate plans that were approved by the LPSC in connection with the full electric base rate cases filed by those companies in February 2013. The formula rate plan is approved for continued use through the test year 2016 filing. Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s electric formula rate plan increases are capped at a cumulative total of $30 million through the formula rate plan cycle. The LPSC also approved in the business combination Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s continuation of a mechanism to recover non-fuel MISO-related costs, which are calculated separately from the formula rate plan requirements, but embedded in the formula rate plan factor applied on customer bills. This recovery mechanism expires following the 2015 test year, and Entergy Louisiana has filed an application seeking to extend that mechanism, which is subject to review and approval by the LPSC. MISO fuel and energy-related costs are recoverable in Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s fuel adjustment clause. The formula rate plan retains exceptions from the rate cap/restrictions and sharing requirements for certain large capital investment projects, including acquisition or construction of generating facilities, as well as purchase power agreements approved by the LPSC. In the event that the electric formula rate plans were terminated, or expired without renewal or extension, Entergy Louisiana would at that time revert to the more traditional rate case environment. 
Entergy New Orleans previously operated under a formula rate plan that ended with the 2011 test year. Currently, based on a settlement agreement approved by the City Council, with limited exceptions, no action may be taken with respect to Entergy New Orleans&#8217; base rates until rates are implemented from a base rate case that must be filed for its electric and gas operations in 2018. The limited exceptions include implementation of the final year of a four-year phased-in rate increase for its Algiers operations in the Fifteenth Ward of the City of New Orleans and certain exceptional cost increases or decreases in its base revenue requirement. 
The Utility operating companies and System Energy, and the energy industry as a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments, and an upward trend in spending, especially with respect to infrastructure investments, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future and could result in more frequent rate cases and requests for, and the continuation of, cost recovery mechanisms. For information regarding rate case proceedings and formula rate plans applicable to the Utility operating companies, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 
The Utility operating companies recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or disallowance in regulatory proceedings. 
The Utility operating companies recover their fuel, purchased power, and associated costs from their customers through rate mechanisms subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. Because regulatory review can result in the disallowance of incurred costs found not to have been prudently incurred, including the cost of replacement power purchased when generators experience outages, with the possibility of refunds to ratepayers, there exists some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulators can also initiate proceedings to investigate the continued usage or the adequacy and operation of the fuel and purchased power recovery clauses of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, there can be no assurance that existing recovery mechanisms will remain unchanged or in effect at all. 
The Utility operating companies&#8217; cash flows can be negatively affected by the time delays between when gas, power, or other commodities are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers of the costs in rates. On occasion, when the level of incurred costs for fuel and purchased power rises very dramatically, some of the Utility operating companies may agree to defer recovery of a portion of that period&#8217;s fuel and purchased power costs for recovery at a later date, which could increase the near-term working capital and borrowing requirements of those companies. For 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
a description of fuel and purchased power recovery mechanisms and information regarding the regulatory proceedings for fuel and purchased power costs recovery, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 
There is uncertainty regarding the effect of the termination of the System Agreement on the Utility operating companies. 
The Utility operating companies historically have engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating resources and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which is a rate schedule that had been approved by the FERC. 
Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s participation in the System Agreement terminated in December 2013, and Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s participation in the System Agreement terminated in November 2015. Pursuant to a settlement agreement approved by the FERC in December 2015, the System Agreement terminated in its entirety with respect to the remaining Utility operating companies on August 31, 2016. 
There is uncertainty regarding the long-term effect of the termination of the System Agreement on the Utility operating companies because of the significant effect of the agreement on the generation and transmission functions of the Utility operating companies and the significant period of time (over 30 years) that it has been in existence. In the absence of the System Agreement, there is uncertainty around the effectiveness of governance processes and the potential absence of federal authority to resolve certain issues among the Utility operating companies and their retail regulators. 
In addition, although the System Agreement terminated in its entirety in August 2016, there are a number of outstanding System Agreement proceedings at the FERC that may require future adjustments, including challenges to the level and timing of payments made by Entergy Arkansas under the System Agreement. The outcome and timing of these FERC proceedings and resulting recovery and impact on rates cannot be predicted at this time. 
For further information regarding the regulatory proceedings relating to the System Agreement, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 
The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the MISO markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs. The operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system pursuant to the MISO RTO tariff and their participation in the MISO RTO&#8217;s wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 
On December 19, 2013, the Utility operating companies integrated into the MISO RTO. MISO maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and administers wholesale energy and ancillary services markets for market participants in the MISO region, including the Utility operating companies. The Utility operating companies sell capacity, energy, and ancillary services on a bilateral basis to certain wholesale customers and offer available electricity production of their generating facilities into the MISO day-ahead and real-time energy markets pursuant to the MISO tariff and market rules. The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the MISO markets. MISO tariff rules and system conditions, including transmission congestion, could affect the Utility operating companies&#8217; ability to sell power in certain regions and/or the economic value of such sales, and MISO market rules may change in ways that cause additional risk. 
The Utility operating companies participate in the MISO regional transmission planning process and are subject to risks associated with planning decisions that MISO makes in the exercise of control over the planning of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission assets that are under MISO&#8217;s functional control. The Utility operating companies pay transmission rates that reflect the cost of transmission projects that the Utility operating companies do not own, which could increase cash or financing needs. The terms and conditions of the MISO tariff, including provisions related to the design and implementation of wholesale markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs, are subject to regulation by FERC. The operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system pursuant to the 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
MISO tariff and their participation in the MISO wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. In addition, orders from each of the Utility operating companies&#8217; respective retail regulators generally require that the Utility operating companies make filings, within a specified period of their integration into MISO, setting forth the results of analysis of the costs and benefits of continued membership in MISO and/or requesting approval of their continued membership in MISO, and the outcome of such proceedings may affect the Utility operating companies&#8217; continued membership in MISO. 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 
A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred as a result of severe weather could have material effects on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather. 
Entergy&#8217;s and its Utility operating companies&#8217; results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition can be materially affected by the destructive effects of severe weather. Severe weather can also result in significant outages for the customers of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, reduced revenues for the Utility operating companies during the period of the outages. A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred or revenues lost as a result of severe weather could have a material effect on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather. 
Nuclear Operating, Shutdown and Regulatory Risks 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy) 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities must consistently operate their nuclear power plants at high capacity factors in order to be successful, and lower capacity factors could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Nuclear capacity factors significantly affect the results of operations of certain Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. Nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs. Consequently, to be successful, a plant owner must consistently operate its nuclear power plants at high capacity factors. For the Utility operating companies that own nuclear plants, lower capacity factors can increase production costs by requiring the affected companies to generate additional energy, sometimes at higher costs, from their fossil facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy their supply needs. For the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants, lower capacity factors directly affect revenues and cash flow from operations. Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; forward sales are comprised of various hedge products, many of which have some degree of operational-contingent price risk. Certain unit-contingent contracts guarantee specified minimum capacity factors. In the event plants with these contracts were operating below the guaranteed capacity factors, Entergy would be subject to price risk for the undelivered power. Further, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear forward sales contracts can also be on a firm LD basis, which subjects Entergy to increasing price risk as capacity factors decrease. Many of these firm hedge products have damages risk, capped through the use of risk management products. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners periodically shut down their nuclear power plants to replenish fuel. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such refueling outages. If refueling outages last longer than anticipated or if unplanned outages arise, Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected. 
Outages at nuclear power plants to replenish fuel require the plant to be &#8220;turned off.&#8221; Refueling outages generally are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months and average approximately 30 days in duration. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such planned outages. When refueling outages last longer than anticipated or a plant experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease and maintenance costs may 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
increase. Lower than forecasted capacity factors may cause Entergy Wholesale Commodities to experience reduced revenues and may also create damages risk with certain hedge products as previously discussed. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities face risks related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication), and the risk of being unable to effectively manage these risks by purchasing from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Based upon currently planned fuel cycles, Entergy&#8217;s nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what Entergy believes are reasonably predictable prices through most of 2017 &#32; and beyond. The nuclear fuel supply portfolio for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment is being adjusted to reflect reduced overall requirements related to the planned permanent shutdown of the Palisades, Pilgrim, Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 plants and the planned sale of the FitzPatrick plant . &#32;&#32;Entergy&#8217;s ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners and enrichers. While there are a number of possible alternate suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, the pricing of any such alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time. Entergy also may draw upon its own inventory intended for later generation periods, depending upon its risk management strategy at that time. Entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S. Market prices for nuclear fuel have been extremely volatile from time to time in the past. Although Entergy&#8217;s nuclear fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against market risks for several years, costs for nuclear fuel in the future cannot be predicted with certainty due to normal inherent market uncertainties, and price increases could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
Entergy&#8217;s ability to assure nuclear fuel supply also depends upon the performance and reliability of conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services providers. These service providers are fewer in number than uranium suppliers. For conversion and enrichment services, Entergy diversifies its supply by supplier and country and may take special measures to ensure a reliable supply of enriched uranium for fabrication into nuclear fuel. For fabrication services, each plant is dependent upon the performance of the fabricator of that plant&#8217;s nuclear fuel; therefore, Entergy relies upon additional monitoring, inspection, and oversight of the fabrication process to assure reliability and quality of its nuclear fuel. Certain of the suppliers and service providers are located in or dependent upon countries, such as Russia, in which deteriorating economic conditions or international sanctions could restrict the ability of such suppliers to continue to supply fuel or provide such services. The inability of such suppliers or service providers to perform such obligations could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business face the risk that the NRC will change or modify its regulations, suspend, not renew, or revoke their licenses, or increase oversight of their nuclear plants, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Under the Atomic Energy Act and Energy Reorganization Act, the NRC regulates the operation of nuclear power plants. The NRC may modify, suspend, not renew, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, related regulations, or the terms of the licenses for nuclear facilities. A change in the Atomic Energy Act, other applicable statutes, or the applicable regulations or licenses, or the NRC&#8217;s interpretation thereof, may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and could materially affect the results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition of Entergy (through Entergy Wholesale Commodities), its Utility operating companies, or System Energy. A change in the classification of a plant owned by one of these companies under the NRC&#8217;s Reactor Oversight Process, which is the NRC&#8217;s program to collect information about plant performance, assess the information for its safety significance, 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
and provide for appropriate licensee and NRC response, also could cause the owner of the plant to incur material additional costs as a result of the increased oversight activity and potential response costs associated with the change in classification. &#32;&#32; For additional information concerning the current classification of the plants owned by Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see ENTERGY&#8217;S BUSINESS - Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business &#32; - Regulation of the Nuclear Power Industry &#32;- NRC Reactor Oversight Process &#32;in Part I, Item 1 and Note 8 to the financial statements. 
Events at nuclear plants owned by one of these companies, as well as those owned by others, may lead to a change in laws or regulations or the terms of the applicable licenses, or the NRC&#8217;s interpretation thereof, or may cause the NRC to increase oversight activity or initiate actions to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility, or impose civil penalties. As a result, if an incident were to occur at any nuclear generating unit, whether an Entergy nuclear generating unit or not, it could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or Entergy Wholesale Commodities. For example, the earthquake of March 11, 2011 that affected the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plants in Japan resulted in the NRC issuing various orders requiring U.S. nuclear operators, including Entergy, to undertake plant modifications or perform additional analyses that, among other things, have resulted in increased capital and operating costs associated with operating Entergy&#8217;s nuclear plants, some of which have been material. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities are exposed to risks and costs related to operating and maintaining their nuclear power plants, and their failure to maintain operational efficiency at their nuclear power plants could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
The nuclear generating units owned by certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, &#160; and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business began commercial operations in the 1970s-1980s. Older equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating safely and efficiently. This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages, or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in increased costs, some of which costs may not be fully recoverable by the Utility operating companies and System Energy in regulatory proceedings. Operations at any of the nuclear generating units owned and operated by Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries could degrade to the point where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. If this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. A decision may be made to close a unit rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the unit to full capacity. For the Utility operating companies and System Energy, this could result in certain costs being stranded and potentially not fully recoverable in regulatory proceedings. For Entergy Wholesale Commodities, this could result in lost revenue and increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments and penalties for failure to perform under their contracts with customers. In addition, the operation and maintenance of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear facilities require the commitment of substantial human resources that can result in increased costs. 
The nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials within plant systems. The issue is applicable at all nuclear units to varying degrees and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines that include in-service examinations, replacements, and mitigation strategies. Developments in the industry or identification of issues at the nuclear units could require unanticipated remediation efforts that cannot be quantified in advance. 
Moreover, Entergy is becoming more dependent on fewer suppliers for key parts of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants that may need to be replaced or refurbished. In addition, certain major parts have long lead-times to manufacture if an unplanned replacement is needed. This dependence on a reduced number of suppliers and long lead-times on certain major parts for unplanned replacements could result in delays in obtaining qualified replacement parts and, therefore, greater expense for Entergy. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
The costs associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, as well as the costs of and their ability to fully decommission their nuclear power plants, could be significantly affected by the timing of the opening of a spent nuclear fuel disposal facility, as well as interim storage and transportation requirements. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants incur costs on a periodic basis for the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. The approval of a license for a national repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, such as the one proposed for Yucca Mountain, Nevada, or any interim storage facility, and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. For example, while the DOE is required by law to proceed with the licensing of Yucca Mountain and, after the license is granted by the NRC, to construct the repository and commence the receipt of spent fuel, the NRC licensing of the Yucca Mountain repository is effectively at a standstill. These actions may prolong the time before spent fuel is removed from Entergy&#8217;s plant sites. Because the DOE has not accomplished its objectives, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts, and Entergy has sued the DOE for such breach. Furthermore, Entergy is uncertain as to when the DOE plans to commence acceptance of spent fuel from its facilities for storage or disposal. As a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at the companies&#8217; nuclear sites and maintenance costs on existing storage facilities may increase. The costs of on-site storage are also affected by regulatory requirements for such storage. In addition, the availability of a repository or other off-site storage facility for spent nuclear fuel may affect the ability to fully decommission the nuclear units and the costs relating to decommissioning. For further information regarding spent fuel storage, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32;&#8211; Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#32;&#8211; Spent Fuel Disposal &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 8 to the financial statements. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to pay substantial retrospective premiums imposed under the Price-Anderson Act in the event of a nuclear incident, and losses not covered by insurance could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. 
Accidents and other unforeseen problems at nuclear power plants have occurred both in the United States and elsewhere. The Price-Anderson Act limits each reactor owner&#8217;s public liability (off-site) for a single nuclear incident to the payment of retrospective premiums into a secondary insurance pool of up to approximately $127.3 million per reactor. With 102 reactors currently participating, this translates to a total public liability cap of approximately $13 billion per incident. The limit is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation, a change in the primary limit of insurance coverage, and changes in the number of licensed reactors. As required by the Price-Anderson Act, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities carry the maximum available amount of primary nuclear off-site liability insurance with American Nuclear Insurers (which is $450 million for each operating site as of January 1, 2017). Claims for any nuclear incident exceeding that amount are covered under the retrospective premiums paid into the secondary insurance pool. As a result, in the event of a nuclear incident that causes damages (off-site) in excess of the primary insurance coverage, each owner of a nuclear plant reactor, including Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident, will be required to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the primary insurance level, up to a maximum of approximately $127.3 million per reactor per incident (Entergy&#8217;s maximum total contingent obligation per incident is $1.273 billion). The retrospective premium payment is currently limited to approximately $19 million per year per incident per reactor until the aggregate public liability for each licensee is paid up to the $127.3 million cap. 
NEIL is a utility industry mutual insurance company, owned by its members. All member plants could be subject to an annual assessment (retrospective premium of up to 10 times current annual premium for all policies) should the surplus (reserve) be significantly depleted due to &#160; insured losses. As of December 31, 2016, the maximum annual assessment amounts total $135.2 million for the Utility plants and $127.4 million for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants. Retrospective premium insurance available through NEIL&#8217;s reinsurance treaty can cover the 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
potential assessments and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants currently maintain the retrospective premium insurance to cover those potential assessments. 
As an owner of nuclear power plants, Entergy participates in industry self-insurance programs and could be liable to fund claims should a plant owned by a different company experience a major event. Any resulting liability from a nuclear accident may exceed the applicable primary insurance coverage and require contribution of additional funds through the industry-wide program that could significantly affect the results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries. 
Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of assets in the decommissioning trusts, which then could require significant additional funding. 
Owners of nuclear generating plants have an obligation to decommission those plants. Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants maintain decommissioning trust funds for this purpose. Certain of the Utility operating companies collect funds from their customers, which are deposited into the trusts covering the units operated for or on behalf of those companies. Those rate collections, as adjusted from time to time by rate regulators, are generally based upon operating license lives and trust fund balances as well as estimated trust fund earnings and decommissioning costs. In connection with the acquisition of certain nuclear plants, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners also acquired decommissioning trust funds that are funded in accordance with NRC regulations. Assets in these trust funds are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns that may fall below projected return rates, and may result in losses resulting from the recognition of impairments of the value of certain securities held in these trust funds. As part of the Pilgrim, Indian Point 1 and Indian Point 2, Vermont Yankee, and Palisades/Big Rock Point purchases, the former owners transferred decommissioning trust funds, along with the liability to decommission the plants, to the respective Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant owners. In addition, the former owner of Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick retained the decommissioning trusts and related liability to decommission these plants, but had the right to require the respective Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners to assume the decommissioning liability provided that it assigned the funds in the corresponding decommissioning trust, up to a specified level, to such owners. Alternatively, the former owner could have contracted with Entergy Nuclear, Inc. for the decommissioning work at a price equal to the funds in the corresponding decommissioning trust up to a specified amount. A request was made to the NRC for permission to transfer the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick decommissioning trusts to Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc., which was received in January 2017. The decommissioning trusts and decommissioning liabilities for the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick plants were transferred to Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. by the former owner in January 2017. As part of the Indian Point 1 and Indian Point 2 purchase, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant owner also funded an additional $25 million to a supplemental decommissioning trust fund. As part of the Palisades transaction, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business assumed responsibility for spent fuel at the decommissioned Big Rock Point nuclear plant, which is located near Charlevoix, Michigan. Once the spent fuel is removed from the site, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business will dismantle the spent fuel storage facility and complete site decommissioning. Entergy is providing $5 million in credit support to provide financial assurance to the NRC for this obligation. 
An early plant shutdown, poor investment results or higher than anticipated decommissioning costs could cause trust fund assets to be insufficient to meet the decommissioning obligations, with the result that the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. For further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32; &#8211; Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 9 to the financial statements. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B

Changes in NRC regulations or other binding regulatory requirements may cause increased funding requirements for nuclear plant decommissioning trusts. 
NRC regulations require certain minimum financial assurance requirements for meeting obligations to decommission nuclear power plants. Those financial assurance requirements may change from time to time, and certain changes may result in a material increase in the financial assurance required for decommissioning the Utility operating companies&#8217;, System Energy&#8217;s, and owners of Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants. Such changes could result in the need for additional contributions to decommissioning trusts, or the posting of parent guarantees, letters of credit, or other surety mechanisms. For further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32; &#8211; Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 9 to the financial statements. 
New or existing safety concerns regarding operating nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel could lead to restrictions upon the operation and decommissioning of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants. 
New and existing concerns are being expressed in public forums about the safety of nuclear generating units and nuclear fuel, in particular in the northeastern United States, which is where most of the current fleet of Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants is located. These concerns have led to, and are expected to continue to lead to, various proposals to Federal regulators and governing bodies in some localities where Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries own nuclear generating units for legislative and regulatory changes that could lead to the shutdown of nuclear units, denial of license renewal applications, restrictions on nuclear units as a result of unavailability of sites for spent nuclear fuel storage and disposal, or other adverse effects on owning, operating and decommissioning nuclear generating units. Entergy vigorously responds to these concerns and proposals. If any of the existing proposals, or any proposals that may arise in the future with respect to legislative and regulatory changes, become effective, they could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
(Entergy Corporation) 
A failure to obtain renewed licenses or other approvals required for the continued operation of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; Indian Point nuclear power plants could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and could lead to an increase in depreciation rates or an acceleration of the timing for the funding of decommissioning obligations. 
The license renewal and related processes for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; Indian Point nuclear power plants have been and may continue to be the subject of significant public debate and regulatory and legislative review and scrutiny at the federal and, in certain cases, state level. The original expiration date of the operating license for Indian Point 2 was September 2013 and the original expiration date of the operating license for Indian Point 3 was December 2015. Because these plants filed timely license renewal applications, the NRC&#8217;s rules provide that these plants may continue to operate under their existing operating licenses until their renewal applications have been finally determined. Various parties have expressed opposition to renewal of these licenses. Renewal of the Indian Point licenses is the subject of ongoing proceedings before the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) of the NRC and, with respect to issues resolved by the ASLB, before the NRC on appeal. 
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has taken the position that Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 must obtain a new state-issued Clean Water Act Section 401 water quality certification as part of the license renewal process. In addition, before the NRC may issue renewed operating licenses it must resolve its obligation to address the requirements of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA). For further information regarding these environmental regulations see the &#8220; Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business &#32;- Environmental Regulation - Clean Water Act &#8221; section in Part I, Item 1. For additional discussion of the 401 and CZMA proceedings related to Indian Point license renewal, see the &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities Authorizations to Operate Its Nuclear Plants &#8221; in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis. In January 2017, Entergy 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
announced that it plans to shut down Indian Point 2 in 2020 and Indian Point 3 in 2021. The early and orderly shutdown is part of a settlement under which New York State has agreed to drop legal challenges and support renewal of the operating licenses for Indian Point. For additional discussion of the settlement agreement with New York, see the &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities Authorizations to Operate Its Nuclear Plants &#8221; in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis. 
If the NRC finally denies the applications for the renewal of operating licenses for the Indian Point nuclear power plants, or if Indian Point fails to obtain other approvals, Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected by loss of revenue and cash flow associated with the plant or plants until the proposed shutdown date, potential impairments of the carrying value of the plants, increased depreciation rates, and an accelerated need for decommissioning funds, which could require additional funding. In addition, Entergy may incur increased operating costs depending on any conditions that may be imposed in connection with license renewal. For further discussion regarding the license renewal processes for the Indian Point nuclear power plants, see the &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities Authorizations to Operate Its Nuclear Plants &#8221; in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis. 
The decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants owned by Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may not be adequate to meet decommissioning obligations if one or more of their nuclear power plants is retired earlier than the anticipated shutdown date, the plants cost more to decommission than estimated, or if current regulatory requirements change, which then could require additional funding. 
Under NRC regulations, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear subsidiaries are permitted to project the NRC-required decommissioning amount, based on an NRC formula or a site-specific estimate, and the amount in each of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant&#8217;s decommissioning trusts combined with other decommissioning financial assurances in place. The projections are made based on the operating license expiration date and the mid-point of the subsequent decommissioning process, or the anticipated actual completion of decommissioning if a site-specific estimate is used, for each of these nuclear power plants. As a result, if the projected amount of individual plants&#8217; decommissioning trusts exceeds the NRC-required decommissioning amount, then its decommissioning obligations are considered to be funded in accordance with NRC regulations. If the projected costs do not sufficiently reflect the actual costs the applicable Entergy subsidiaries would be required to incur to decommission these nuclear power plants, or funding is otherwise inadequate, or if the formula, formula inputs, or site-specific estimate is changed to require increased funding, additional resources would be required. Furthermore, depending upon the level of funding available in the trust funds, the NRC may not permit the trust funds to be used to pay for related costs such as the management of spent nuclear fuel that are not included in the NRC&#8217;s formula. The NRC may also require a plan for the provision of separate funding for spent fuel management costs. In addition to NRC requirements, there are other decommissioning-related obligations for certain of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, which management believes it will be able to satisfy. 
Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries have announced plans to sell the FitzPatrick nuclear power plant and shut down the Pilgrim, Palisades, Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 nuclear power plants earlier than the respective license expiration date of the plants (or the license expiration date assuming 20 year renewed licenses for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3). As discussed previously, the former owner of Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick retained the decommissioning trusts and related liability to decommission these plants, but had the right to require the respective Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners to assume the decommissioning liability provided that it assigned the funds in the corresponding decommissioning trust, up to a specified level, to such owners. Alternatively, the former owner could have contracted with Entergy Nuclear, Inc. for the decommissioning work at a price equal to the funds in the corresponding decommissioning trust up to a specified amount. A request was made to the NRC for permission to transfer the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick decommissioning trusts to Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc., which was received in January 2017. The decommissioning trusts and decommissioning liabilities for the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick plants were transferred to Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc. by the former owner in January 2017. As part of the Indian Point 1 and Indian Point 2 purchase, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant owner also funded an additional $25 million to a supplemental decommissioning trust fund. If decommissioning of these 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
plants were conducted without the full benefit of a safe storage period, or if funding is otherwise inadequate for an earlier decommissioning, the applicable Entergy subsidiary may be unable to rely upon only the decommissioning trust to fund the entire decommissioning obligation, which would require it to obtain funding from other sources. 
Vermont Yankee submitted notification of permanent cessation of operations and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor in January 2015 after final shutdown in December 2014. The Post Shutdown Decommissioning Activities Report for Vermont Yankee, including a site specific cost estimate, was submitted to the NRC in December 2014. Vermont Yankee&#8217;s future certifications to satisfy the NRC&#8217;s financial assurance requirements will now be based on the site specific cost estimate, including the estimated cost of managing spent fuel, rather than the NRC minimum formula for estimating decommissioning costs. Entergy expects that amounts available in Vermont Yankee&#8217;s decommissioning trust fund, including expected earnings, together with the credit facilities entered into in January 2015 that are expected to be repaid with recoveries from DOE litigation related to spent fuel storage, will be sufficient to cover expected costs of decommissioning, spent fuel management costs, and site restoration. Future NRC filings will determine whether any other financial assurance may be required, including additional funding for spent fuel management, which will be required until the federal government takes possession of the fuel and removes it from the site, per its current obligation. In June 2015 the NRC granted an exemption allowing use of Vermont Yankee&#8217;s decommissioning trust funds for operational spent fuel management activities at that site. In August 2015, Vermont and two Vermont utilities filed a petition in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging the NRC&#8217;s issuance of that exemption. In February 2016 the court dismissed the petition as premature because Vermont and the utilities had requested the NRC to reconsider a number of issues related to Vermont Yankee's use of the decommissioning trust fund including use to pay for spent fuel management expenses pursuant to the exemption granted in June 2015. In October 2016 the NRC denied Vermont's and the utilities' request for a hearing and other relief , including their challenge to the propriety of the exemption&#8217;s issuance, but directed the NRC staff to conduct an assessment of any environmental impacts associated with the exemption. In November 2016, Entergy announced that it has entered into a purchase and sale agreement with NorthStar Group Services, Inc. to sell to a NorthStar subsidiary 100% of the membership interests in Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee, the owner of the Vermont Yankee plant. The sale of Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee to NorthStar will include the transfer of Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee&#8217;s nuclear decommissioning trust and its obligations for spent fuel management and decommissioning and is subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. See the &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power Business &#32;- Shutdown and Planned Sale of Vermont Yankee &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries and Note 14 to the financial statements for further information about the agreement to sell Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee to a subsidiary of NorthStar. 
Further, federal or state regulatory changes, including mandated increases in decommissioning funding or changes in the methods or standards for decommissioning operations, may also increase the funding requirements of, or accelerate the timing for funding of, the obligations related to the decommissioning of Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants or may restrict the decommissioning-related costs that can be paid from the decommissioning trusts. As a result, under any of these circumstances, Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially affected. 
Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are exposed to price risk. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries do not have a regulator-authorized rate of return on their capital investments in non-utility businesses. In particular, the sale of capacity and energy from the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, unless otherwise contracted, is subject to the fluctuation of market power prices. In order to reduce future price risk to desired levels, Entergy Wholesale Commodities utilizes contracts that are unit-contingent and Firm LD and various products such as forward sales, options, and collars. As of December 31, 2016, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear power generation plants had sold forward 87% in 2017, 56% in 2018, and 5% in 2019 of its generation portfolio&#8217;s planned energy output, reflecting the planned shutdown or sale of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants by 2021. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Market conditions such as product cost, market liquidity, and other portfolio considerations influence the product and contractual mix. The obligations under unit-contingent agreements depend on a generating asset that is operating; if the generation asset is not operating, the seller generally is not liable for damages. For some unit-contingent obligations, however, there is also a guarantee of availability that provides for the payment to the power purchaser of contract damages, if incurred, in the event the unit owner fails to deliver power as a result of the failure of the specified generation unit to generate power at or above a specified availability threshold. Firm LD sales transactions may be exposed to substantial operational price risk, a portion of which may be capped through the use of risk management products, to the extent that the plants do not run as expected and market prices exceed contract prices. 
Market prices may fluctuate substantially, sometimes over relatively short periods of time, and at other times experience sustained increases or decreases. Demand for electricity and its fuel stock can fluctuate dramatically, creating periods of substantial under- or over-supply. During periods of over-supply, prices might be depressed. Also, from time to time there may be political pressure, or pressure from regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over wholesale and retail energy commodity and transportation rates, to impose price limitations, credit requirements, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address volatility and other issues in these markets. 
The effects of sustained low natural gas prices and power market structure challenges have resulted in lower market prices for electricity in the power regions where the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are located. In addition, currently the market design under which the plants operate does not adequately compensate merchant nuclear plants for their environmental and fuel diversity benefits in the region. These conditions were primary factors leading to Entergy&#8217;s decision to shut down (or sell) Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear power plants before the end of their operating licenses (or requested operating licenses for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3). 
The price that different counterparties offer for various products including forward sales is influenced both by market conditions as well as the contract terms such as damage provisions, credit support requirements, and the number of available counterparties interested in contracting for the desired forward period. Depending on differences between market factors at the time of contracting versus current conditions, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; contract portfolio may have average contract prices above or below current market prices, including at the expiration of the contracts, which may significantly affect Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. New hedges are generally layered into on a rolling forward basis, which tends to drive hedge over-performance to market in a falling price environment, and hedge underperformance to market in a rising price environment; however, hedge timing, product choice, and hedging costs will also affect these results. See the &#8220; Market and Credit Risk Sensitive Instruments &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries. Since Entergy Wholesale Commodities has announced the closure (or sale) of its nuclear plants, Entergy Wholesale Commodities may enter into fewer forward sales contracts for output from such plants. 
Among the factors that could affect market prices for electricity and fuel, all of which are beyond Entergy&#8217;s control to a significant degree, are: 
prevailing market prices for natural gas, uranium (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication), coal, oil, and other fuels used in electric generation plants, including associated transportation costs, and supplies of such commodities; 
seasonality and realized weather deviations compared to normalized weather forecasts; 
availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources and the requirements of a renewable portfolio standard; 
changes in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal and crude oil, and refined products; 
liquidity in the general wholesale electricity market, including the number of creditworthy counterparties available and interested in entering into forward sales agreements for Entergy&#8217;s full hedging term; 
the actions of external parties, such as the FERC and local independent system operators and other state or Federal energy regulatory bodies, that may impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in the energy markets; 
electricity transmission, competing generation or fuel transportation constraints, inoperability, or inefficiencies; 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
the general demand for electricity, which may be significantly affected by national and regional economic conditions; 
weather conditions affecting demand for electricity or availability of hydroelectric power or fuel supplies; 
the rate of growth in demand for electricity as a result of population changes, regional economic conditions, and the implementation of conservation programs or distributed generation; 
regulatory policies of state agencies that affect the willingness of Entergy Wholesale Commodities customers to enter into long-term contracts generally, and contracts for energy in particular; 
increases in supplies due to actions of current Entergy Wholesale Commodities competitors or new market entrants, including the development of new generation facilities, expansion of existing generation facilities, the disaggregation of vertically integrated utilities, and improvements in transmission that allow additional supply to reach Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear markets; 
union and labor relations; 
changes in Federal and state energy and environmental laws and regulations and other initiatives, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, including but not limited to, the price impacts of proposed emission controls; 
changes in law resulting from federal or state energy legislation or legislation subjecting energy derivatives used in hedging and risk management transactions to governmental regulation; and 
natural disasters, terrorist actions, wars, embargoes, and other catastrophic events. 
The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative, regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 
The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulation. Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability. 
Public utilities under the Federal Power Act are required to obtain FERC acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity. Each of the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants that generates electricity, as well as Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing, LLC, is a &#8220;public utility&#8221; under the Federal Power Act by virtue of making wholesale sales of electric energy and/or owning wholesale electric transmission facilities. The FERC has granted these generating and power marketing companies the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. The FERC&#8217;s orders that grant the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; generating and power marketing companies market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if the FERC subsequently determines that the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if any of its generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority and potential penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation. If the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; generating or power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain the FERC&#8217;s acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have an adverse effect on the rates the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business charges for power from its facilities. 
The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules imposed by the existing Independent System Operators. The Independent System Operators that oversee most of the wholesale power markets impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps and other mechanisms, to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets. These types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on the profitability of the Entergy Wholesale 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Commodities business&#8217; generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets. For further information regarding federal, state and local laws and regulation applicable to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see the &#8220; Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business &#8221; section in Part I, Item 1. 
The regulatory environment applicable to the electric power industry is subject to changes as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. Entergy cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. In addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism and have raised claims that the competitive marketplace is not working because energy prices in wholesale markets exceed the marginal cost of operating nuclear power plants, as well as proposals to re-regulate the markets, impose a generation tax, or require divestitures by generating companies to reduce their market share. Other proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process, which could require material changes to business planning models. If competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, modified, discontinued, or delayed, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected. 
The power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to impairment charges in certain circumstances, which could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
Entergy reviews long-lived assets held in all of its business segments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of these assets is uncertain. Generally, the determination of recoverability is based on the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the operations of such assets. Projected net cash flows depend on the expected operating life of the assets, the future operating costs associated with the assets, the efficiency and availability of the assets and generating units, and the future market and price for energy and capacity over the remaining life of the assets. In particular, the assets of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to further impairment in connection with the closure or sale of the plants discussed below. Moreover, prior to the closure or sale of these plants, the failure of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows, an unfavorable change in forecasted operating results or cash flows, a reduction in the expected remaining useful life of a unit (including if the operating licenses for the Indian Point power plants are not renewed by the NRC), or a decline in observable industry market multiples could all result in potential additional impairment charges for the affected assets. 
On August 27, 2013, Entergy announced its plan to close and decommission Vermont Yankee. Vermont Yankee ceased power production in the fourth quarter 2014 at the end of a fuel cycle. This decision was approved by the Board in August 2013, and resulted in the recognition of impairment charges in 2013 and 2014. In October 2015, Entergy determined that it will close the Pilgrim and FitzPatrick plants. The Pilgrim plant will cease operations no later than June 1, 2019. FitzPatrick was expected to shut down at the end of its current fuel cycle, planned for January 27, 2017, but in August 2016, Entergy entered into an agreement to sell the FitzPatrick plant to Exelon Generation Company, LLC which will continue to operate the plant. During the third quarter 2015, Entergy recorded impairment and other related charges to write down the carrying values of the FitzPatrick and Pilgrim plants and related assets to their fair values. In addition, in the fourth quarter 2015, Entergy recorded impairment and other related charges to write down the carrying value of the Palisades plant and related assets to their fair value. In December 2016, Entergy reached an agreement with Consumers Energy to terminate the PPA for the Palisades plant in 2018. If the agreement receives regulatory approval, Palisades will shut down in 2018. In January 2017, Entergy announced that it reached a settlement with New York State and plans to close the Indian Point 2 plant in 2020 and the Indian Point 3 plant in 2021. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2016, Entergy recorded impairment and other related charges to write down the carrying values of the Palisades and Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 plants and related assets to their fair value. In addition to the impairments and other related charges, Entergy has incurred severance and employee retention costs and expects to incur additional charges through 2021 relating to the decisions to shut down Vermont Yankee, Palisades, Pilgrim, Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3, and the decision to sell FitzPatrick.

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
If Entergy concludes that any of its nuclear power plants is unlikely to operate through its current useful life, which conclusion would be based on a variety of factors, such a conclusion could result in a further impairment of part or all of the carrying value of the plant. Any impairment charge taken by Entergy with respect to its long-lived assets, including the power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, would likely be material in the quarter that the charge is taken and could otherwise have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. For further information regarding evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32;- Impairment of Long-lived Assets and Trust Fund Investments &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries and for further discussion of the impairment charges, see Note 14 to the financial statements. 
General Business 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 
Entergy and the Utility operating companies depend on access to the capital markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could make it more difficult to handle future contingencies such as natural disasters or substantial increases in gas and fuel prices. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and the cost of capital. 
Entergy&#8217;s business is capital intensive and dependent upon its ability to access capital at reasonable rates and other terms. At times there are also spikes in the price for natural gas and other commodities that increase the liquidity requirements of the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. In addition, Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather-related or unforeseen disaster similar to that experienced in Entergy&#8217;s service territory with Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in 2005, Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike in 2008, and Hurricane Isaac in 2012. The occurrence of one or more contingencies, including a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel or purchased power costs or storm restoration costs, higher than expected pension contributions, an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines, less cash flow from operations than expected, or other unknown events, such as future storms, could cause the financing needs of Entergy and its subsidiaries to increase. In addition, accessing the debt capital markets more frequently in these situations may result in an increase in leverage. Material leverage increases could negatively affect the credit ratings of Entergy and the Utility operating companies, which in turn could negatively affect access to the capital markets. 
The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively affect Entergy and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to maintain and to expand their businesses. Events beyond Entergy&#8217;s control, such as the volatility and disruption in global capital and credit markets in 2008 and 2009, may create uncertainty that could increase its cost of capital or impair its ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on its bank credit facilities. Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their credit facilities as they come up for renewal. Moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. If Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could impact their ability to grow their businesses, decrease earnings, significantly reduce financial flexibility and/or limit Entergy Corporation&#8217;s ability to sustain its current common stock dividend level.

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) 
A downgrade in Entergy Corporation &#8217; s or its subsidiaries &#8217; credit ratings could negatively affect Entergy Corporation &#8217; s and its subsidiaries &#8217; ability to access capital and/or could require Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries to post collateral, accelerate certain payments, or repay certain indebtedness. 
There are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for each of Entergy Corporation and the Registrant Subsidiaries, including each Registrant&#8217;s regulatory framework, ability to recover costs and earn returns, diversification and financial strength and liquidity. If one or more rating agencies downgrade Entergy Corporation&#8217;s, any of the Utility operating companies&#8217;, or System Energy&#8217;s ratings, particularly below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and cash or letter of credit collateral demands may be triggered by the terms of a number of commodity contracts, leases, and other agreements. 
Most of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; large customers, suppliers, and counterparties require sufficient creditworthiness to enter into transactions. If Entergy Corporation&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; ratings decline, particularly below investment grade, or if certain counterparties believe Entergy Corporation or the Utility operating companies are losing creditworthiness and demand adequate assurance under fuel, gas, and purchased power contracts, the counterparties may require posting of collateral in cash or letters of credit, prepayment for fuel, gas or purchased power or accelerated payment, or counterparties may decline business with Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2016, based on power prices at that time, Entergy had liquidity exposure of $128 million under the guarantees in place supporting Entergy Wholesale Commodities transactions and $8 million of posted cash collateral. In the event of a decrease in Entergy Corporation&#8217;s credit rating to below investment grade, based on power prices as of December 31, 2016, Entergy would have been required to provide approximately $57 million of additional cash or letters of credit under some of the agreements. In the event of a decrease in the credit ratings of Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies to below investment grade, those companies collectively could be required to provide up to $50 million of additional cash or letters of credit to MISO. As of December 31, 2016, the liquidity exposure associated with Entergy Wholesale Commodities assurance requirements, including return of previously received collateral from counterparties, would increase by $238 million for a $1 per MMBtu increase in gas prices in both the short- and long-term markets. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to successfully complete strategic transactions, including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring or other strategic transactions, is subject to significant risks, including the risk that required regulatory or governmental approvals may not be obtained, risks relating to unknown or undisclosed problems or liabilities, and the risk that for these or other reasons, Entergy and its subsidiaries may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that they anticipate from such transactions. 
From time to time, Entergy and its subsidiaries have pursued and may continue to pursue strategic transactions including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring or other strategic transactions. In particular, as discussed in the &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities Exit from the Merchant Power Business &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries, in August 2016, Entergy entered into an agreement to sell the FitzPatrick plant to Exelon Generation Company, LLC. Further, in November 2016, Entergy announced that it has entered into a purchase and sale agreement with NorthStar for the sale of 100% of the membership interests in Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee, which owns the Vermont Yankee plant. In addition, as part of Entergy&#8217;s plan to exit the merchant power business, it plans to shut down its remaining merchant nuclear power plants by 2021. These transactions are subject to regulatory approval and other material conditions or contingencies. The failure to complete these transactions or any future strategic transaction successfully or on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on Entergy&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations and the market&#8217;s perception of Entergy&#8217;s ability to execute its strategy. Further, these transactions, and any completed or future strategic transactions, involve substantial risks, including the following: 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
the disposition of a business or asset may involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, transition service agreements, guarantees, indemnities, or other current or contingent financial obligations; 
Entergy may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner when it decides to sell an asset or a business, which could delay the accomplishment of its strategic objectives. Alternatively, Entergy may dispose of a business or asset at a price or on terms that are less than what it had anticipated, or with the exclusion of assets that must be divested or run off separately; 
the disposition of a business could result in impairments and related write-offs of the carrying values of the relevant assets; 
acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels; 
acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate; 
Entergy and/or its subsidiaries may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to them, that exceed their estimates, or for which their rights to indemnification from the seller are limited; 
the disposition of a business, including Entergy&#8217;s planned exit from the merchant power business, could divert management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns; 
Entergy and/or its subsidiaries may be unable to obtain the necessary regulatory or governmental approvals to close a transaction, such approvals may be granted subject to terms that are unacceptable to them, or Entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve anticipated regulatory treatment of any such transaction or acquired business or assets; and 
Entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that they anticipate from the transaction, or such benefits may be delayed or may not occur at all. 
Entergy may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that it may encounter in acquiring or divesting a business, or engaging in other strategic transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. 
The construction of, and capital improvements to, power generation facilities involve substantial risks. Should construction or capital improvement efforts be unsuccessful, the financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies could be materially affected. 
Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; ability to complete construction of power generation facilities in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. These variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise and escalating costs for materials, labor, and environmental compliance. Delays in obtaining permits, shortages in materials and qualified labor, suppliers and contractors not performing as required under their contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, poor quality initial cost estimates from contractors, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel costs, or materials costs, downward changes in the economy, changes in law or regulation, including environmental compliance requirements, and other events beyond the control of the Utility operating companies or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost, and performance of these projects. If these projects are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, Entergy and the Utility operating companies could incur additional costs and termination payments, or face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project. In addition, the Utility operating companies could be exposed to higher costs and market volatility, which could affect cash flow and cost recovery, should their respective regulators decline to approve the construction of new generation needed to meet the reliability needs of customers at the lowest reasonable cost. For further information regarding capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital in connection with the potential construction of additional generation supply sources within the Utility operating companies&#8217; service territory, and as to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see the &#8220; Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of the Registrant Subsidiaries. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters. 
The businesses in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation by local, state, and federal authorities. These laws and regulations affect the manner in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business conduct their operations and make capital expenditures. These laws and regulations also affect how the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business manage air emissions, discharges to water, wetlands impacts, solid and hazardous waste storage and disposal, cooling and service water intake, the protection of threatened and endangered species, hazardous materials transportation, and similar matters. Federal, state, and local authorities continually revise these laws and regulations, and the laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and to the permitting and enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. Developing and implementing plans for facility compliance with these requirements can lead to capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures. Violations of these requirements can subject the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties&#8217; claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. In addition, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business potentially are subject to liability under these laws for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned or operated by the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. The Utility operating companies are currently involved in proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been released and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance. 
Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury, particulates, greenhouse gases, and other regulated air emissions from generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulation, controls and mitigation expenses. In addition, existing air regulations and programs promulgated by the EPA often are challenged legally, sometimes resulting in large-scale changes to anticipated regulatory regimes and the resulting need to shift course, both operationally and economically, depending on the nature of the changes. Risks relating to global climate change, initiatives to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions, and water availability issues are discussed below. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if Entergy and its subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, the operation of its facilities could be stopped or become subject to additional costs. For further information regarding environmental regulation and environmental matters, see the &#8220; Regulation of Entergy &#8217; s Business &#32; &#8211; Environmental Regulation &#8221; section of Part I, Item 1. 
The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs related to reliability standards. 
Entergy&#8217;s business is subject to extensive and mandatory reliability standards. Such standards, which are established by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), the SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC), and other regional enforcement entities, are approved by the FERC and frequently are reviewed, amended, and supplemented. Failure to comply with such standards could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of such standards. The standards, as well as the laws and regulations that govern them, are subject to judicial interpretation and to the enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. In addition to exposure to civil penalties and fines, the Utility operating companies have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to compliance with new and existing reliability standards, including costs associated with the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system and generation assets. The changes to the 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
reliability standards applicable to the electric power industry are ongoing, and Entergy cannot predict the ultimate effect that the reliability standards will have on its Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 
The effects of weather and economic conditions, and the related impact on electricity and gas usage, may materially affect the Utility operating companies &#8217; results of operations. 
Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase electric cooling demand and revenues, and temperatures below normal levels in the winter tend to increase electric and gas heating demand and revenues. As a corollary, moderate temperatures in either season tend to decrease usage of energy and resulting revenues. Seasonal pricing differentials, coupled with higher consumption levels, typically cause the Utility operating companies to report higher revenues in the third quarter of the fiscal year than in the other quarters. Extreme weather conditions or storms, however, may stress the Utility operating companies&#8217; generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on their ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. These extreme conditions could have a material effect on the Utility operating companies&#8217; financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
Entergy&#8217;s electricity sales volumes are affected by a number of factors, including economic conditions, weather, customer bill sizes (large bills tend to induce conservation), trends in energy efficiency, new technologies and self generation alternatives, including the willingness and ability of large industrial customers to develop co-generation facilities that greatly reduce their demand from Entergy. Some of these factors are inherently cyclical or temporary in nature, such as the weather or economic conditions, and rarely have a long-lasting effect on Entergy&#8217;s operating results. Others, such as the increasing adoption of energy efficient appliances, new building codes, and new technologies are having a more permanent effect of reducing sales growth rates from historical norms. Distributed generation has not had a substantive impact on Entergy&#8217;s electricity sales yet, but further advances have the potential to do so in the future. Electricity sales to industrial customers, in particular, benefit from steady economic growth and favorable commodity prices and are also sensitive to changes in conditions in the markets in which its customers operate. Any negative change in any of these or other factors has the potential to result in slower sales growth or sales declines and increased bad debt expense, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
The effects of climate change and environmental and regulatory obligations intended to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions or to place a price on greenhouse gas emissions could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. 
In an effort to address climate change concerns, federal, state, and local authorities are calling for additional laws and regulations aimed at known or suspected causes of climate change. For example, in response to the United States Supreme Court&#8217;s 2007 decision holding that the EPA has authority to regulate emissions of CO2 and other &#8220;greenhouse gases&#8221; under the Clean Air Act, the EPA, various environmental interest groups, and other organizations are focusing considerable attention on CO2 emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. In 2010, EPA promulgated its first regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from certain vehicles and from new and significantly modified stationary sources of emissions, including electric generating units. During 2012 and 2014, EPA proposed CO2 emission standards for new and existing sources; EPA finalized these standards in 2015. As examples of state action, in the Northeast, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) establishes a cap on CO2 emissions from electric power plants and requires generators to purchase emission permits to cover their CO2 emissions, and a similar program has been developed in California. The impact that recent changes in the federal government will have on existing and pending environmental laws and regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions is currently unclear. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Developing and implementing plans for compliance with greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing facilities and proposed projects; moreover, long-term planning to meet environmental requirements can be negatively impacted and costs may increase to the extent laws and regulations change prior to full implementation. These requirements could, in turn, lead to changes in the planning or operations of balancing authorities or organized markets in areas where the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or Entergy Wholesale Commodities do business. Violations of such requirements may subject Entergy Wholesale Commodities and the Utility operating companies to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties&#8217; claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. To the extent Entergy believes any of these costs are recoverable in rates, however, additional material rate increases for customers could be resisted by Entergy&#8217;s regulators and, in extreme cases, Entergy&#8217;s regulators might deny or defer timely recovery of these costs. Future changes in environmental regulation governing the emission of CO2 and other greenhouse gases could make some of Entergy&#8217;s electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the difficulty that Entergy and its subsidiaries have with obtaining or maintaining required environmental regulatory approvals, which could also materially affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of Entergy and its subsidiaries. In addition, lawsuits have occurred or are reasonably expected against emitters of greenhouse gases alleging that these companies are liable for personal injuries and property damage caused by climate change. These lawsuits may seek injunctive relief, monetary compensation, and punitive damages. 
In addition to the regulatory and financial risks associated with climate change discussed above, potential physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level, wind and storm surge damages, wetland and barrier island erosion, risks of flooding and changes in weather conditions, (such as increases in precipitation, drought, or changes in average temperatures), and potential increased impacts of extreme weather conditions or storms. Entergy subsidiaries own assets in, and serve, communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, storms, and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands. A significant portion of the nation&#8217;s oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by wetland and barrier island erosion, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes. Entergy and its subsidiaries also face the risk that climate change could impact the availability and quality of water supply necessary for operations. 
These and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on the Entergy System&#8217;s ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. Also, to the extent that climate change adversely impacts the economic health of a region or results in energy conservation or demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and revenues. Such physical or operational risks could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217;, System Energy&#8217;s, and the Utility operating companies&#8217; financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
Continued and future availability and quality of water for cooling, process, and sanitary uses could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. 
Water is a vital natural resource that is also critical to the Utility operating companies&#8217; , &#32;System Energy&#8217;s, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; business operations. Entergy&#8217;s facilities use water for cooling, boiler make-up, sanitary uses, potable supply, and many other uses. Two of Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies own and/or operate hydroelectric facilities. Accordingly, water availability and quality are critical to Entergy&#8217;s business operations. Impacts to water availability or quality could negatively impact both operations and revenues. 
Entergy secures water through various mechanisms (ground water wells, surface waters intakes, municipal supply, etc.) and operates under the provisions and conditions set forth by the provider and/or regulatory authorities. Entergy also obtains and operates in substantial compliance with water discharge permits issued under 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
various provisions of the Clean Water Act and/or state water pollution control provisions. Regulations and authorizations for both water intake and use and for waste discharge can become more stringent in times of water shortages, low flows in rivers, low lake levels, low groundwater aquifer volumes, and similar conditions. The increased use of water by industry, agriculture, and the population at large, population growth, and the potential impacts of climate change on water resources may cause water use restrictions that affect Entergy and its subsidiaries. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity prices, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
To manage near-term financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, Entergy and its subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, may enter into contracts to hedge portions of their purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements, and inventories of natural gas, uranium and its conversion and enrichment, coal, refined products, and other commodities, within established risk management guidelines. As part of this strategy, Entergy and its subsidiaries may utilize fixed- and variable-price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. However, Entergy and its subsidiaries normally cover only a portion of the exposure of their assets and positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. In addition, Entergy also elects to leave certain volumes during certain years unhedged. To the extent Entergy and its subsidiaries have unhedged positions, fluctuating commodity prices can materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations and financial position. 
Although Entergy and its subsidiaries devote a considerable effort to these risk management strategies, they cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these activities. As a result of these and other factors, Entergy and its subsidiaries cannot predict with precision the impact that risk management decisions may have on their business, results of operations, or financial position. 
Entergy has guaranteed or indemnified the performance of a portion of the obligations relating to hedging and risk management activities. Reductions in Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; credit quality or changes in the market prices of energy commodities could increase the cash or letter of credit collateral required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management activities, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity and financial position. 
The Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations, which may materially affect the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
The hedging and risk management practices of the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe Entergy and its subsidiaries money, energy, or other commodities will not perform their obligations. Currently, some hedging agreements contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure all or part of their obligations to Entergy or its subsidiaries. If the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, Entergy or its subsidiaries may enforce and recover the proceeds from the credit support provided and acquire alternative hedging arrangements, which credit support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. In such event, Entergy and its subsidiaries might incur losses in addition to amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. In addition, the credit commitments of Entergy&#8217;s lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such lenders, which could materially affect the adequacy of its liquidity sources. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
The Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010 and rules and regulations promulgated under the act may adversely affect the ability of the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to utilize certain commodity derivatives for hedging and mitigating commercial risk. 
The Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, which was enacted on July 21, 2010 as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Act), and the rules and regulations promulgated under the act impose governmental regulation on the over-the-counter derivative market, including the commodity swaps used by the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to hedge and mitigate commercial risk. Under the Act, certain swaps are subject to mandatory clearing and exchange trading requirements. Swap dealers and major market participants in the swap market are subject to capital, margin, registration, reporting, recordkeeping, and business conduct requirements with respect to their swap activities. Entergy is not a swap dealer or a major swap participant, and does not expect to qualify as either in the future. Non-swap dealers and non-major swap participants, such as Entergy, are subject to reporting, recordkeeping, and business conduct requirements (i.e., anti-manipulation, anti-disruptive trading practices, and whistleblower provisions) with respect to their swap activities. Position limits may also apply to certain swaps activities. Position limit rules promulgated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission were vacated by the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has subsequently proposed new position limit rules. If the Commodity Futures Trading Commission&#8217;s issues final position limit rules, those rules may apply to certain of Entergy&#8217;s swaps activities. 
The Act required the applicable regulators, which in the case of commodity swaps will be the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to engage in substantial rulemaking in order to implement the provisions of the Act and such rulemaking has been largely completed. Both the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business currently utilize commodity swaps to hedge and mitigate commodity price risk. It is not known whether the Act and regulations promulgated under the Act will have an adverse effect upon the market for the commodity swaps used by the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. However, to the extent that the Act and regulations promulgated under the Act have the effect of increasing the price of such commodity swaps or limiting or reducing the availability of such commodity swaps, whether through the imposition of additional capital, margin, or compliance costs upon market participants, the imposition of position limits, or otherwise, the financial performance of the Utility operating companies and/or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may be adversely affected. To the extent that the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may be required to post margin in connection with existing or future commodity swaps in addition to any margin currently posted by such entities, such entities may need to secure additional sources of capital to meet such liquidity needs or cease utilizing such commodity swaps. 
Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require additional funding and result in increased benefit plan costs. 
The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under Entergy&#8217;s pension and postretirement benefit plans. A decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements relating to Entergy&#8217;s benefit plan liabilities and also result in higher benefit costs. As the value of the assets decreases, the &#8220;expected return on assets&#8221; component of benefit costs decreases, resulting in higher benefits costs. Additionally, asset losses are incorporated into benefit costs over time, thus increasing benefits costs. Volatility in the capital markets has affected the market value of these assets, which may affect Entergy&#8217;s planned levels of contributions in the future. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Entergy&#8217;s pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding and recognition of higher liability carrying costs. The funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans can also increase as a result of changes in, among other factors, retirement rates, life expectancy assumptions, or Federal regulations. For further information regarding Entergy&#8217;s pension and other postretirement benefit plans, refer to the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32; &#8211; Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of its Registrant Subsidiaries and Note 11 to the financial statements. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
The litigation environment in the states in which certain Entergy subsidiaries operate poses a significant risk to those businesses. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, asbestos, hazardous material and ratepayer matters, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters. The states in which the Utility operating companies operate, in particular Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, have proven to be unusually litigious environments. Judges and juries in these states have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort cases. Entergy and its subsidiaries use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against them, but the litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk. 
Domestic or international terrorist attacks, including cyber attacks, and failures or breaches of Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; technology systems may adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s results of operations. 
As power generators and distributors, Entergy and its subsidiaries face heightened risk of an act or threat of terrorism, including physical and cyber attacks, either as a direct act against one of Entergy&#8217;s generation facilities, transmission operations centers, or distribution infrastructure used to manage and transport power to customers. An actual act could affect Entergy&#8217;s ability to operate, including its ability to operate the information technology systems and network infrastructure on which it relies to conduct its business. The Utility operating companies also face heightened risk of an act or threat by cyber criminals, intent on accessing personal information for the purpose of committing identity theft. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure in accordance with prescriptive standards. Despite the implementation of multiple layers of security by Entergy and its subsidiaries, technology systems remain vulnerable to potential threats that could lead to unauthorized access or loss of availability to critical systems essential to the reliable operation of Entergy&#8217;s electric system. If Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; technology systems were compromised and unable to recover timely to a normal state of operations, Entergy or its subsidiaries may be unable to perform critical business functions that are essential to the company&#8217;s well-being and the health, safety, and security needs of its customers. In addition, an attack on its information technology infrastructure may result in a loss of its confidential, sensitive, and proprietary information, including personal information of its customers, employees, vendors, and others in Entergy&#8217;s care. 
If any such attacks, failures or breaches were to occur, Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The risk of such attacks, failures, or breaches may cause Entergy and the Utility operating companies to incur increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for its nuclear power plants and other facilities, such as additional physical facility security and additional security personnel, and for systems to protect its information technology and network infrastructure systems. Such events may also expose Entergy to an increased risk of judgments and fines. 
Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact Entergy&#8217;s, the Utility operating companies&#8217;, and System Energy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes. These judgments include provisions for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. Entergy and its subsidiaries also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. Changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by Entergy and its subsidiaries could negatively affect Entergy&#8217;s, the Utility operating companies&#8217;, and System Energy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
The Trump administration has included as part of its agenda a potential reform of U.S. tax laws, and House Republicans plan to advance their tax reform &#8220;blueprint.&#8221; Tax reform proposals call for, among other items, a reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from the current 35% to as low as 15%, the immediate deduction of capital investment expenditures, and full or partial elimination of debt interest expense deductions. Further, for the Utility operating companies, regulators may impose rate reductions to provide the benefit of any income tax expense reductions to customers and refund &#8220;excess&#8221; deferred income taxes. For these reasons, Entergy, the Utility operating companies, and System Energy cannot predict the effect any potential changes may have on their future results of operations, cash flows, or financial position, and such changes could be significant. 
For further information regarding Entergy&#8217;s income taxes, see Note 3 to the financial statements. 
(Entergy New Orleans) 
The effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers may adversely affect Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s results of operations and liquidity. 
Gas rates charged to retail gas customers are comprised primarily of purchased gas cost charges, which provide no return or profit to Entergy New Orleans, and distribution charges, which provide a return or profit to the utility. Distribution charges are affected by the amount of gas sold to customers. Purchased gas cost charges, which comprise most of a customer&#8217;s bill and may be adjusted monthly, represent gas commodity costs that Entergy New Orleans recovers from its customers. Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s cash flows can be affected by differences between the time period when gas is purchased and the time when ultimate recovery from customers occurs. When purchased gas cost charges increase substantially reflecting higher gas procurement costs incurred by Entergy New Orleans, customer usage may decrease, especially in weaker economic times, resulting in lower distribution charges for Entergy New Orleans, which could adversely affect results of operations. 
(System Energy) 
System Energy owns and operates a single nuclear generating facility, and it is dependent on affiliated companies for all of its revenues. 
System Energy&#8217;s operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% ownership/leasehold interest in Grand Gulf. Charges under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are paid by the Utility operating companies as consideration for their respective entitlements to receive capacity and energy. The useful economic life of Grand Gulf is finite and is limited by the terms of its operating license, which expires in November 2044. System Energy&#8217;s financial condition depends both on the receipt of payments from the Utility operating companies under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and on the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf. 
For information regarding the Unit Power Sales Agreement, the sale and leaseback transactions and certain other agreements relating to the Entergy System companies&#8217; support of System Energy (including the Capital Funds Agreement), see Notes 8 and 10 to the financial statements and the &#8220; Utility &#32;- System Energy and Related Agreements &#8221; section of Part I, Item 1. 
(Entergy Corporation) 
As a holding company, Entergy Corporation depends on cash distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock. 
Entergy Corporation is a holding company with no material revenue generating operations of its own or material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, all of its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. Entergy Corporation&#8217;s ability to satisfy its financial obligations, including the payment of interest and principal on its outstanding debt, and to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the payment to it of dividends 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
or distributions by its subsidiaries. The payments of dividends or distributions to Entergy Corporation by its subsidiaries in turn depend on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings, and on any applicable legal, regulatory, or contractual limitations on subsidiaries&#8217; ability to pay such dividends or distributions. Provisions in the articles of incorporation of certain of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s subsidiaries restrict the payment of cash dividends to Entergy Corporation. For further information regarding dividend or distribution restrictions to Entergy Corporation, see Note 7 to the financial statements.

RISK FACTORS 
Investors should review carefully the following risk factors and the other information in this Form 10-K. The risks that Entergy faces are not limited to those in this section. There may be additional risks and uncertainties (either currently unknown or not currently believed to be material) that could adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. See &#8220; FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION .&#8221; 
Utility Regulatory Risks 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) 
The terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the Utility operating companies and System Energy are determined through regulatory approval proceedings that are lengthy and subject to appeal that could result in delays in effecting rate changes and uncertainty as to ultimate results. 
The rates that the Utility operating companies and System Energy charge reflect their capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, allowed rates of return, financing costs, and related costs of service. These rates significantly influence the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and each of the Utility operating companies and System Energy. These rates are determined in regulatory proceedings and are subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. 
In addition, regulators can initiate proceedings to investigate the prudence of costs in the Utility operating companies&#8217; base rates and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of the companies&#8217; operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures (including storm costs and costs associated with capital projects), allowed rates of return and rate base, proposed resource acquisitions, and previously incurred capital expenditures that the operating companies seek to place in rates. The regulators can disallow costs subject to their jurisdiction found not to have been prudently incurred or found not to have been incurred in compliance with applicable tariffs, creating some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or reduce rates. Traditional base rate proceedings, as opposed to formula rate plans, generally have long timelines, are primarily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited in scope or duration by statute. The length of these base rate proceedings can cause the Utility operating companies and System Energy to experience regulatory lag in recovering costs through rates. Decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings. 
The base rates of Entergy Texas are established in traditional base rate case proceedings. Entergy Texas also has filed to use rate riders to recover the revenue requirements associated with distribution-related capital investments and transmission-related capital investments and certain MISO charges. 
Between base rate cases, Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi are able to adjust base rates annually through formula rate plans that utilize forward test years. In its pending application for a general change in rates, Entergy Arkansas notified the APSC that it is electing to have its rates regulated under a formula rate review mechanism pursuant to legislation enacted by the Arkansas General Assembly in early 2015. Entergy Arkansas submitted a formula rate plan tariff with a projected year test period and an initial five-year term for approval by the APSC. The initial five-year term expires in 2021 unless Entergy Arkansas requests, and the APSC approves, the extension of the formula rate plan tariff for an additional five years through 2026. In the event that Entergy Arkansas&#8217; formula rate plan is terminated or is not extended beyond the initial term, Entergy Arkansas could file an application for a general change in rates that may include a request for continued regulation under a formula rate review mechanism. If Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s formula rate plan is terminated, it would revert to the more traditional rate case environment or seek approval of a new formula rate plan. Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi recover fuel and purchased energy and certain non-fuel costs through other APSC-approved and MPSC-approved tariffs, respectively. 
Entergy Louisiana sets electric base rates annually through a formula rate plan using an historic test year. The form of the formula rate plan, on a combined basis, was approved in connection with the business combination of Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and largely followed the formula rate plans that were approved by the LPSC in connection with the full electric base rate cases filed by those companies in February 2013. The formula rate plan is approved for continued use through the test year 2016 filing. Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s electric formula rate plan increases are capped at a cumulative total of $30 million through the formula rate plan cycle. The LPSC also approved in the business combination Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s continuation of a mechanism to recover non-fuel MISO-related costs, which are calculated separately from the formula rate plan requirements, but embedded in the formula rate plan factor applied on customer bills. This recovery mechanism expires following the 2015 test year and is subject to review for renewal by the LPSC. MISO fuel and energy-related costs are recoverable in Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s fuel adjustment clause. The formula rate plan retains exceptions from the rate cap/restrictions and sharing requirements for certain large capital investment projects, including the Ninemile 6 generating facility. In the event that the electric formula rate plans were terminated, or expired without renewal or extension, Entergy Louisiana would at that time revert to the more traditional rate case environment. 
Entergy New Orleans previously operated under a formula rate plan that ended with the 2011 test year. Currently, based on a settlement agreement approved by the City Council, with limited exceptions, no action may be taken with respect to Entergy New Orleans&#8217; base rates until rates are implemented from a base rate case that must be filed for its electric and gas operations in 2018. The limited exceptions include continued implementation of the remaining two years of a four-year phased-in rate increase for its recently acquired Algiers operations in the Fifteenth Ward of the City of New Orleans and certain exceptional cost increases or decreases in its base revenue requirement. 
The Utility operating companies and System Energy, and the energy industry as a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments, and an upward trend in spending, especially with respect to infrastructure investments, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future and could result in more frequent rate cases and requests for, and the continuation of, cost recovery mechanisms. For information regarding rate case proceedings and formula rate plans applicable to the Utility operating companies, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 
The Utility operating companies recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or disallowance in regulatory proceedings. 
The Utility operating companies recover their fuel, purchased power, and associated costs from their customers through rate mechanisms subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. Because regulatory review can result in the disallowance of incurred costs found not to have been prudently incurred with the possibility of refunds to ratepayers, there exists some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulators can also initiate proceedings to investigate the continued usage or the adequacy and operation of the fuel and purchased power recovery clauses of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, there can be no assurance that existing recovery mechanisms will remain unchanged or in effect at all. 
The Utility operating companies&#8217; cash flows can be negatively affected by the time delays between when gas, power, or other commodities are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers of the costs in rates. On occasion, when the level of incurred costs for fuel and purchased power rises very dramatically, some of the Utility operating companies may agree to defer recovery of a portion of that period&#8217;s fuel and purchased power costs for recovery at a later date, which could increase the near-term working capital and borrowing requirements of those companies. For a description of fuel and purchased power recovery mechanisms and information regarding the regulatory proceedings for fuel and purchased power costs recovery, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 
There is uncertainty regarding the effect of the termination of the System Agreement on the Utility operating companies. 
The Utility operating companies historically have engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating resources and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which is a rate schedule that has been approved by the FERC. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s participation in the System Agreement terminated in December 2013, and Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s participation in the System Agreement terminated in November 2015. Pursuant to a settlement agreement approved by the FERC in December 2015, the System Agreement will terminate in its entirety with respect to the remaining Utility operating companies on August 31, 2016. 
There is uncertainty regarding the effect of the termination of the System Agreement on the Utility operating companies because of the significant effect of the agreement on the generation and transmission functions of the Utility operating companies and the significant period of time (over 30 years) that it has been in existence. In the absence of the System Agreement, there is uncertainty around governance processes and the potential absence of federal authority to resolve certain issues among the Utility operating companies and their retail regulators. 
In addition, although the System Agreement will terminate in its entirety in August 2016, there are a number of outstanding System Agreement proceedings at the FERC that may require future adjustments, including challenges to the level and timing of payments made by Entergy Arkansas under the System Agreement. The outcome and timing of these FERC proceedings and resulting recovery and impact on rates cannot be predicted at this time. 
For further information regarding the regulatory proceedings relating to the System Agreement, see the &#8220; Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation &#32;- Federal Regulation &#32;- System Agreement &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries and Note 2 to financial statements, System Agreement Cost Equalization Proceedings . 
The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the MISO markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs. The operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system pursuant to the MISO RTO tariff and their participation in the MISO RTO&#8217;s wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 
On December 19, 2013, the Utility operating companies integrated into the MISO RTO. For further information regarding the FERC and proceedings related to the MISO RTO, see the &#8220; Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation &#32;- Federal Regulation - Entergy&#8217;s Integration Into the MISO Regional Transmission Organization &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries. MISO maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and administers wholesale energy and ancillary services markets for market participants in the MISO region, including the Utility operating companies. The Utility operating companies sell capacity, energy, and ancillary services on a bilateral basis to certain wholesale customers and offer available electricity production of their generating facilities into the MISO day-ahead and real-time energy markets pursuant to the MISO tariff and market rules. The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the MISO markets. MISO tariff rules and system conditions, including transmission congestion, could affect the Utility operating companies&#8217; ability to sell power in certain regions and/or the economic value of such sales, and MISO market rules may change in ways, including the implementation of competition among transmission providers, that cause additional risk. 
The Utility operating companies participate in the MISO regional transmission planning process and are subject to risks associated with planning decisions that MISO makes in the exercise of control over the planning of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission assets that are under MISO&#8217;s functional control. The Utility operating companies pay transmission rates that reflect the cost of transmission projects that the Utility operating companies do not own, which could increase cash or financing needs. The terms and conditions of the MISO tariff, including provisions related to the design and implementation of wholesale markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs, are subject to regulation by FERC. The operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system pursuant to the MISO tariff and their participation in the MISO wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. In addition, orders from each of the Utility operating companies&#8217; respective retail regulators generally require that the Utility operating companies make filings, within a specified period of their integration into MISO, 
setting forth the results of analysis of the costs and benefits of continued membership in MISO and/or requesting approval of their continued membership in MISO, and the outcome of such proceedings may affect the Utility operating companies&#8217; continued membership in MISO. 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 
A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred as a result of severe weather could have material effects on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather. 
Entergy&#8217;s and its Utility operating companies&#8217; results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition can be materially affected by the destructive effects of severe weather. Severe weather can also result in significant outages for the customers of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, reduced revenues for the Utility operating companies during the period of the outages. A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred or revenues lost as a result of severe weather could have a material effect on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather. 
Nuclear Operating and Regulatory Risks 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy) 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities must consistently operate their nuclear power plants at high capacity factors in order to be successful, and lower capacity factors could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Nuclear capacity factors significantly affect the results of operations of certain Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. Nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs. Consequently, to be successful, a plant owner must consistently operate its nuclear power plants at high capacity factors. For the Utility operating companies that own nuclear plants, lower capacity factors can increase production costs by requiring the affected companies to generate additional energy, sometimes at higher costs, from their fossil facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy their supply needs. For the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants, lower capacity factors directly affect revenues and cash flow from operations. Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; forward sales are comprised of various hedge products, many of which have some degree of operational-contingent price risk. Certain unit-contingent contracts guarantee specified minimum capacity factors. In the event plants with these contracts were operating below the guaranteed capacity factors, Entergy would be subject to price risk for the undelivered power. Further, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear forward sales contracts can also be on a firm LD basis, which subjects Entergy to increasing price risk as capacity factors decrease. Many of these firm hedge products have damages risk, capped through the use of risk management products. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners periodically shut down their nuclear power plants to replenish fuel. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such refueling outages. If refueling outages last longer than anticipated or if unplanned outages arise, Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected. 
Outages at nuclear power plants to replenish fuel require the plant to be &#8220;turned off.&#8221; Refueling outages generally are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months and average approximately 30 days in duration. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such planned outages. When refueling outages last longer than anticipated or a plant experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease and maintenance costs may increase. Lower than forecasted capacity factors may cause Entergy Wholesale Commodities to experience reduced revenues and may also create damages risk with certain hedge products as previously discussed. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities face risks related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication), and the risk of being unable to effectively manage these risks by purchasing from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Based upon currently planned fuel cycles, Entergy&#8217;s nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what Entergy believes are reasonably predictable prices through most of 2016 &#32; and beyond. The nuclear fuel supply portfolio for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment is being adjusted to reflect reduced overall requirements related to the planned permanent shutdown of the FitzPatrick and Pilgrim plants and the recent shutdown of the Vermont Yankee plant . &#32;&#32;Entergy&#8217;s ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners and enrichers. While there are a number of possible alternate suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, the pricing of any such alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time. Entergy also may draw upon its own inventory intended for later generation periods, depending upon its risk management strategy at that time. Entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S. Market prices for nuclear fuel have been extremely volatile from time to time in the past. Although Entergy&#8217;s nuclear fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against market risks for several years, costs for nuclear fuel in the future cannot be predicted with certainty due to normal inherent market uncertainties, and price increases could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
Entergy&#8217;s ability to assure nuclear fuel supply also depends upon the performance and reliability of conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services providers. These service providers are fewer in number than uranium suppliers. For conversion and enrichment services, Entergy diversifies its supply by supplier and country and may take special measures to ensure a reliable supply of enriched uranium for fabrication into nuclear fuel. For fabrication services, each plant is dependent upon the performance of the fabricator of that plant&#8217;s nuclear fuel; therefore, Entergy relies upon additional monitoring, inspection, and oversight of the fabrication process to assure reliability and quality of its nuclear fuel. Certain of the suppliers and service providers are located in or dependent upon countries, such as Russia, in which deteriorating economic conditions or international sanctions could restrict the ability of such suppliers to continue to supply fuel or provide such services. The inability of such suppliers or service providers to perform such obligations could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business face the risk that the NRC will change or modify its regulations, suspend or revoke their licenses, or increase oversight of their nuclear plants, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Under the Atomic Energy Act and Energy Reorganization Act, the NRC regulates the operation of nuclear power plants. The NRC may modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, related regulations, or the terms of the licenses for nuclear facilities. A change in the Atomic Energy Act, other applicable statutes, or the applicable regulations or licenses, or the NRC&#8217;s interpretation thereof, may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and could materially affect the results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition of Entergy (through Entergy Wholesale Commodities), its Utility operating companies, or System Energy. A change in the classification of a plant owned by one of these companies under the NRC&#8217;s Reactor Oversight Process, which is the NRC&#8217;s program to collect information about plant performance, assess the information for its safety significance, and provide for appropriate licensee and NRC response, also could cause the owner of the plant to incur material additional costs as a result of the increased oversight activity and potential response costs associated with the change in classification. &#32;&#32; For additional information concerning the current classification of the plants owned by Entergy 
Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see ENTERGY&#8217;S BUSINESS - Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business &#32; - Regulation of the Nuclear Power Industry &#32;- NRC Reactor Oversight Process &#32;in Part I, Item 1 and Note 8 to the financial statements. 
Events at nuclear plants owned by one of these companies, as well as those owned by others, may lead to a change in laws or regulations or the terms of the applicable licenses, or the NRC&#8217;s interpretation thereof, or may cause the NRC to increase oversight activity or initiate actions to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility, or impose civil penalties. As a result, if an incident were to occur at any nuclear generating unit, whether an Entergy nuclear generating unit or not, it could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or Entergy Wholesale Commodities. For example, the earthquake of March 11, 2011 that affected the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plants in Japan resulted in the NRC issuing three orders effective on March 12, 2012 requiring U.S. nuclear operators, including Entergy, to undertake plant modifications or perform additional analyses that, among other things, have resulted in increased capital and operating costs associated with operating Entergy&#8217;s nuclear plants, some of which have been and will be material. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities are exposed to risks and costs related to operating and maintaining their nuclear power plants, and their failure to maintain operational efficiency at their nuclear power plants could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
The nuclear generating units owned by certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, &#160; and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business began commercial operations in the 1970s-1980s. Older equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating efficiently. This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages, or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in reduced profitability. Operations at any of the nuclear generating units owned and operated by Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries could degrade to the point where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. If this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. A decision may be made to close a unit rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the unit to full capacity. For Entergy Wholesale Commodities, this could result in lost revenue and increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments and penalties for failure to perform under their contracts with customers. The nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials within the reactor coolant system. The issue is applicable at all nuclear units to varying degrees and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines that include in-service examinations, replacements, and mitigation strategies. Developments in the industry or identification of issues at the nuclear units could require unanticipated remediation efforts that cannot be quantified in advance. 
Moreover, Entergy is becoming more dependent on fewer suppliers for key parts of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants that may need to be replaced or refurbished. In addition, certain major parts have long lead-times to manufacture if an unplanned replacement is needed. This dependence on a reduced number of suppliers and long lead-times on certain major parts for unplanned replacements could result in delays in obtaining qualified replacement parts and, therefore, greater expense for Entergy. 
The costs associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, as well as the costs of and their ability to fully decommission their nuclear power plants, could be significantly affected by the timing of the opening of a spent nuclear fuel disposal facility, as well as interim storage and transportation requirements. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants incur costs on a periodic basis for the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. The approval of a license for a national repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, such as the one proposed for Yucca Mountain, Nevada, or any interim storage facility, and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
associated with on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. For example, while the DOE is required by law to proceed with the licensing of Yucca Mountain and, after the license is granted by the NRC, to construct the repository and commence the receipt of spent fuel, the Obama administration has expressed its intention and taken specific steps to discontinue the Yucca Mountain project and study a new spent fuel strategy. The NRC licensing of the Yucca Mountain repository is effectively at a standstill. These actions may prolong the time before spent fuel is removed from Entergy&#8217;s plant sites. Because the DOE has not accomplished its objectives, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts, and Entergy has sued the DOE for such breach. Furthermore, Entergy is uncertain as to when the DOE plans to commence acceptance of spent fuel from its facilities for storage or disposal. As a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at the companies&#8217; nuclear sites. The costs of on-site storage are also affected by regulatory requirements for such storage. In addition, the availability of a repository or other off-site storage facility for spent nuclear fuel may affect the ability to fully decommission the nuclear units and the costs relating to decommissioning. For further information regarding spent fuel storage, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32;&#8211; Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#32;&#8211; Spent Fuel Disposal &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to pay substantial retrospective premiums imposed under the Price-Anderson Act in the event of a nuclear incident, and losses not covered by insurance could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. 
Accidents and other unforeseen problems at nuclear power plants have occurred both in the United States and elsewhere. The Price-Anderson Act limits each reactor owner&#8217;s public liability (off-site) for a single nuclear incident to the payment of retrospective premiums into a secondary insurance pool of up to approximately $127.318 million per reactor. With 103 reactors currently participating, this translates to a total public liability cap of approximately $13.114 billion per incident. The limit is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation, a change in the primary limit of insurance coverage, and changes in the number of licensed reactors. As required by the Price-Anderson Act, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities carry the maximum available amount of primary nuclear off-site liability insurance with American Nuclear Insurers (currently $375 million for each operating site). Claims for any nuclear incident exceeding that amount are covered under the retrospective premiums paid into the secondary insurance pool. As a result, in the event of a nuclear incident that causes damages (off-site) in excess of the $375 million in primary insurance coverage, each owner of a nuclear plant reactor, including Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident, will be required to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the $375 million primary level, up to a maximum of $127.318 million per reactor per incident (Entergy&#8217;s maximum total contingent obligation per incident is $1.4 billion). The retrospective premium payment is currently limited to $18.963 million per year per incident per reactor until the aggregate public liability for each licensee is paid up to the $127.318 million cap. 
NEIL is a utility industry mutual insurance company, owned by its members. All member plants could be subject to an annual assessment (retrospective premium of up to 10 times current annual premium for all policies) should the surplus (reserve) be significantly depleted due to &#160; insured losses. As of April 1, 2015, the maximum annual assessment amounts total $124 million for the Utility plants and $127.7 million for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants. Retrospective Premium Insurance available through NEIL&#8217;s reinsurance treaty can cover the potential assessments. The Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants currently maintain the Retrospective Premium Insurance to cover this potential assessment. 
As an owner of nuclear power plants, Entergy participates in industry self-insurance programs and could be liable to fund claims should a plant owned by a different company experience a major event. Any resulting liability from a nuclear accident may exceed the applicable primary insurance coverage and require contribution of additional funds through the industry-wide program that could significantly affect the results of operations, financial condition, 
or liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries. 
Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of assets in the decommissioning trusts, which then could require significant additional funding. 
Owners of nuclear generating plants have an obligation to decommission those plants. Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants maintain decommissioning trust funds for this purpose. Certain of the Utility operating companies collect funds from their customers, which are deposited into the trusts covering the units operated for or on behalf of those companies. Those rate collections are based upon operating license lives as well as estimated trust fund earnings and decommissioning costs. In connection with the acquisition of certain nuclear plants, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners also acquired decommissioning trust funds that are funded in accordance with NRC regulations. Assets in these trust funds are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns that may fall below projected return rates, and may result in losses resulting from the recognition of impairments of the value of certain securities held in these trust funds. As part of the Pilgrim, Indian Point 1 and 2, Vermont Yankee, and Palisades/Big Rock Point purchases, the former owners transferred decommissioning trust funds, along with the liability to decommission the plants, to the respective Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant owners. In addition, the former owner of Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick retained the decommissioning trusts and related liability to decommission these plants, but has the right to require the respective Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners to assume the decommissioning liability provided that it assigns the funds in the corresponding decommissioning trust, up to a specified level, to such owners. Alternatively, the former owner may contract with Entergy Nuclear, Inc. for the decommissioning work at a price equal to the funds in the corresponding decommissioning trust up to a specified amount. As part of the Indian Point 1 and 2 purchase, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant owner also funded an additional $25 million to a supplemental decommissioning trust fund. As part of the Palisades transaction, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business assumed responsibility for spent fuel at the decommissioned Big Rock Point nuclear plant, which is located near Charlevoix, Michigan. Once the spent fuel is removed from the site, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business will dismantle the spent fuel storage facility and complete site decommissioning. The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business expects to fund this activity from operating revenue, and Entergy is providing $5 million in credit support to provide financial assurance to the NRC for this obligation. 
In 2008, Entergy experienced declines in the market value of assets held in the trust funds for meeting its decommissioning funding assurance obligations for its plants. This decline adversely affected Entergy&#8217;s ability to demonstrate compliance with the NRC&#8217;s requirements for providing financial assurance for decommissioning funding for some of its plants, which deficiencies have now been corrected. An early plant shutdown, poor investment results or higher than anticipated decommissioning costs could cause trust fund assets to be insufficient to meet the decommissioning obligations, with the result that the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. For further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32; &#8211; Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 9 to the financial statements. 
Changes in NRC regulations or other binding regulatory requirements may cause increased funding requirements for nuclear plant decommissioning trusts. 
NRC regulations require certain minimum financial assurance requirements for meeting obligations to decommission nuclear power plants. Those financial assurance requirements may change from time to time, and certain changes may result in a material increase in the financial assurance required for decommissioning the Utility operating companies&#8217;, System Energy&#8217;s and owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants. Such changes could result in the need for additional contributions to decommissioning trusts, or the posting of parent guarantees, letters of credit, or other surety mechanisms. For further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32; &#8211; Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial

Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 9 to the financial statements. 
New or existing safety concerns regarding operating nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel could lead to restrictions upon the operation of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants. 
New and existing concerns are being expressed in public forums about the safety of nuclear generating units and nuclear fuel, in particular in the northeastern United States, which is where five of the six units in the current fleet of Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are located. These concerns have led to, and are expected to continue to lead to, various proposals to Federal regulators and governing bodies in some localities where Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries own nuclear generating units for legislative and regulatory changes that could lead to the shutdown of nuclear units, denial of license renewal applications, restrictions on nuclear units as a result of unavailability of sites for spent nuclear fuel storage and disposal, or other adverse effects on owning and operating nuclear generating units. Entergy vigorously responds to these concerns and proposals. If any of the existing proposals, or any proposals that may arise in the future with respect to legislative and regulatory changes, become effective, they could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
(Entergy Corporation) 
A failure to obtain renewed licenses or other approvals required for the continued operation of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and could lead to an increase in depreciation rates or an acceleration of the timing for the funding of decommissioning obligations. 
The license renewal and related processes for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants have been and may continue to be the subject of significant public debate and regulatory and legislative review and scrutiny at the federal and, in certain cases, state level. The original expiration date of the operating license for Indian Point 2 was September 2013 and the original expiration date of the operating license for Indian Point 3 was December 2015. Because these plants filed timely license renewal applications, the NRC&#8217;s rules provide that these plants may continue to operate under their existing operating licenses until their renewal applications have been finally determined. Various parties have expressed opposition to renewal of these licenses. Renewal of the Indian Point licenses is the subject of ongoing proceedings before the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) of the NRC and, with respect to issues resolved by the ASLB, before the NRC on appeal. 
In relation to Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has taken the position that these plant owners must obtain a new state-issued Clean Water Act Section 401 water quality certification as part of the license renewal process. In addition, before the NRC may issue renewed operating licenses it must resolve its obligation to address the requirements of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA). For further information regarding these environmental regulations see the &#8220; Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business &#32;- Environmental Regulation - Clean Water Act &#8221; section in Part I, Item 1. For additional discussion of the 401 and CZMA proceedings related to Indian Point license renewal, see the &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities Authorizations to Operate Its Nuclear Plants &#8221; in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis. 
If the NRC finally denies the applications for the renewal of operating licenses for one or more of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, or a state in which any such nuclear power plant is located is able to prevent the continued operation of such plant, Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected by loss of revenue and cash flow associated with the plant or plants, potential impairments of the carrying value of the plants, increased depreciation rates, and an accelerated need for decommissioning funds, which could require additional funding. In addition, Entergy may incur increased operating costs depending on any conditions that may be imposed in connection with license renewal. For further discussion regarding the license renewal processes for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, see the &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities 
Authorizations to Operate Its Nuclear Plants &#8221; in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis. 
The decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants owned by Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may not be adequate to meet decommissioning obligations if one or more of their nuclear power plants is retired earlier than the anticipated shutdown date, the plants cost more to decommission than estimated, or if current regulatory requirements change, which then could require additional funding. 
Under NRC regulations, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear subsidiaries are permitted to project the NRC-required decommissioning amount, based on an NRC formula or a site-specific estimate, and the amount in each of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant&#8217;s decommissioning trusts combined with other decommissioning financial assurances in place. The projections are made based on the operating license expiration date and the mid-point of the subsequent decommissioning process, or the anticipated actual completion of decommissioning if a site-specific estimate is used, for each of these nuclear power plants. As a result, if the projected amount of individual plants&#8217; decommissioning trusts exceeds the NRC-required decommissioning amount, then its decommissioning obligations are considered to be funded in accordance with NRC regulations. If the projected costs do not sufficiently reflect the actual costs the applicable Entergy subsidiaries would be required to incur to decommission these nuclear power plants, and funding is otherwise inadequate, or if the formula or site-specific estimate is changed to require increased funding, additional resources would be required. Furthermore, depending upon the level of funding available in the trust funds, the NRC may not permit the trust funds to be used to pay for related costs such as the management of spent nuclear fuel that are not included in the NRC&#8217;s formula. The NRC may also require a plan for the provision of separate funding for spent fuel management costs. In addition to NRC requirements, there are other decommissioning-related obligations for certain of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, which management believes it will be able to satisfy. 
If any Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiary decides to shut down one of its nuclear power plants earlier than the scheduled shutdown date and conduct decommissioning without the full benefit of a safe storage period, the applicable Entergy subsidiary may be unable to rely upon only the decommissioning trust to fund the entire decommissioning obligations, which would require it to obtain funding from other sources. 
Vermont Yankee submitted notification of permanent cessation of operations and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor in January 2015 after final shutdown in December 2014. The Post Shutdown Decommissioning Activities Report for Vermont Yankee, including a site specific cost estimate, was submitted to the NRC in December 2014. Vermont Yankee&#8217;s future certifications to satisfy the NRC&#8217;s financial assurance requirements will now be based on the site specific cost estimate, including the estimated cost of managing spent fuel, rather than the NRC minimum formula for estimating decommissioning costs. Entergy expects that amounts available in Vermont Yankee&#8217;s decommissioning trust fund, including expected earnings, together with the credit facilities entered into in January 2015 that are expected to be repaid with recoveries from DOE litigation related to spent fuel storage, will be sufficient to cover expected costs of decommissioning, spent fuel management costs, and site restoration. Future NRC filings will determine whether any other financial assurance may be required, including additional funding for spent fuel management, which will be required until the federal government takes possession of the fuel and removes it from the site, per its current obligation. In June 2015 the NRC granted an exemption allowing use of decommissioning trust funds for spent fuel management activities. In August 2015, Vermont and two Vermont utilities filed a petition in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging the NRC&#8217;s issuance of that exemption. If the appeal were to result in a final decision denying Vermont Yankee the exemption, Vermont Yankee would have to satisfy the NRC that it had a plan to obtain additional funds to enable it to pay for these costs until the federal government takes possession of the fuel and removes it from the site. 
Further, federal or state regulatory changes, including mandated increases in decommissioning funding or changes in the methods or standards for decommissioning operations, may also increase the funding requirements of, or accelerate the timing for funding of, the obligations related to the decommissioning of Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants or may restrict the decommissioning-related costs that can be paid from the 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
decommissioning trusts. As a result, under any of these circumstances, Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially affected. 
Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are exposed to price risk. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries do not have a regulator-authorized rate of return on their capital investments in non-utility businesses. In particular, the sale of capacity and energy from the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, unless otherwise contracted, is subject to the fluctuation of market power prices. In order to reduce future price risk to desired levels, Entergy Wholesale Commodities utilizes contracts that are unit-contingent and Firm LD and various products such as forward sales, options, and collars. As of December 31, 2015, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear power generation plants had sold forward 86%, 63%, 21%, 26%, and 27% of its generation portfolio&#8217;s planned energy output for 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. 
Market conditions such as product cost, market liquidity, and other portfolio considerations influence the product and contractual mix. The obligations under unit-contingent agreements depend on a generating asset that is operating; if the generation asset is not operating, the seller generally is not liable for damages. For some unit-contingent obligations, however, there is also a guarantee of availability that provides for the payment to the power purchaser of contract damages, if incurred, in the event the unit owner fails to deliver power as a result of the failure of the specified generation unit to generate power at or above a specified availability threshold. Firm LD sales transactions may be exposed to substantial operational price risk, a portion of which may be capped through the use of risk management products, to the extent that the plants do not run as expected and market prices exceed contract prices. 
Market prices may fluctuate substantially, sometimes over relatively short periods of time, and at other times experience sustained increases or decreases. Demand for electricity and its fuel stock can fluctuate dramatically, creating periods of substantial under- or over-supply. During periods of over-supply, prices might be depressed. Also, from time to time there may be political pressure, or pressure from regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over wholesale and retail energy commodity and transportation rates, to impose price limitations, credit requirements, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address volatility and other issues in these markets. 
The effects of sustained low natural gas prices and power market structure challenges have resulted in lower market prices for electricity in the power regions where the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are located. The market price trend presents a challenging economic situation for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants. The severity of the challenge varies for each of the plants based on a variety of factors such as their market for both energy and capacity, their size, their contracted positions, and the amount of investment required to continue to operate and maintain the safety and integrity of the plants, including the estimated asset retirement costs. In addition, currently the market design under which the plants operate does not adequately compensate merchant nuclear plants for their environmental and fuel diversity benefits in the region. 
The price that different counterparties offer for various products including forward sales is influenced both by market conditions as well as the contract terms such as damage provisions, credit support requirements, and the number of available counterparties interested in contracting for the desired forward period. Depending on differences between market factors at the time of contracting versus current conditions, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; contract portfolio may have average contract prices above or below current market prices, including at the expiration of the contracts, which may significantly affect Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. New hedges are generally layered into on a rolling forward basis, which tends to drive hedge over-performance to market in a falling price environment, and hedge underperformance to market in a rising price environment; however, hedge timing, product choice, and hedging costs will also affect these results. See the &#8220; Results of Operations &#32;- Realized Revenue per MWh for Entergy Wholesale Commodities Nuclear Plants &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries. Since the operating licenses for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 expired in 2013 and 2015, respectively (see discussion above regarding the continued operation of Indian Point 2 and 3 past the license expiration dates), and as a consequence of any delays in obtaining extension of the operating licenses and any other approvals required for continued operation of the plants, Entergy Wholesale Commodities may 
enter into fewer unit-contingent forward sales contracts for output from such plants for periods beyond the license expiration. 
Among the factors that could affect market prices for electricity and fuel, all of which are beyond Entergy&#8217;s control to a significant degree, are: 
prevailing market prices for natural gas, uranium (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication), coal, oil, and other fuels used in electric generation plants, including associated transportation costs, and supplies of such commodities; 
seasonality and realized weather deviations compared to normalized weather forecasts; 
availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources and the requirements of a renewable portfolio standard; 
changes in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal and crude oil, and refined products; 
liquidity in the general wholesale electricity market, including the number of creditworthy counterparties available and interested in entering into forward sales agreements for Entergy&#8217;s full hedging term; 
the actions of external parties, such as the FERC and local independent system operators and other state or Federal energy regulatory bodies, that may impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in the energy markets; 
electricity transmission, competing generation or fuel transportation constraints, inoperability, or inefficiencies; 
the general demand for electricity, which may be significantly affected by national and regional economic conditions; 
weather conditions affecting demand for electricity or availability of hydroelectric power or fuel supplies; 
the rate of growth in demand for electricity as a result of population changes, regional economic conditions, and the implementation of conservation programs or distributed generation; 
regulatory policies of state agencies that affect the willingness of Entergy Wholesale Commodities customers to enter into long-term contracts generally, and contracts for energy in particular; 
increases in supplies due to actions of current Entergy Wholesale Commodities competitors or new market entrants, including the development of new generation facilities, expansion of existing generation facilities, the disaggregation of vertically integrated utilities, and improvements in transmission that allow additional supply to reach Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear markets; 
union and labor relations; 
changes in Federal and state energy and environmental laws and regulations and other initiatives, including but not limited to, the price impacts of proposed emission controls such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI); 
changes in law resulting from federal or state energy legislation or legislation subjecting energy derivatives used in hedging and risk management transactions to governmental regulation; and 
natural disasters, terrorist actions, wars, embargoes, and other catastrophic events. 
The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative, regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 
The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulation. Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability. 
Public utilities under the Federal Power Act are required to obtain FERC acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity. Each of the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants that generates electricity, as well as Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing, LLC, is a &#8220;public utility&#8221; under the Federal Power Act by virtue of making wholesale sales of electric energy and/or owning wholesale electric transmission facilities. The FERC has granted these generating and power marketing companies the authority to sell electricity at 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
market-based rates. The FERC&#8217;s orders that grant the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; generating and power marketing companies market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if the FERC subsequently determines that the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if any of its generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority and potential penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation. If the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; generating or power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain the FERC&#8217;s acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have an adverse effect on the rates the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business charges for power from its facilities. 
The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules imposed by the existing Independent System Operators. The Independent System Operators that oversee most of the wholesale power markets impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps and other mechanisms, to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets. These types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on the profitability of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business&#8217; generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets. For further information regarding federal, state and local laws and regulation applicable to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see the &#8220; Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business &#8221; section in Part I, Item 1. 
The regulatory environment applicable to the electric power industry has undergone substantial changes over the past several years as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. These changes are ongoing and Entergy cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. In addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism and have raised claims that the competitive marketplace is not working because energy prices in wholesale markets exceed the marginal cost of operating nuclear power plants, as well as proposals to re-regulate the markets, impose a generation tax, or require divestitures by generating companies to reduce their market share. Other proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process, which could require material changes to business planning models. If competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, modified, discontinued, or delayed, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected. 
The power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to impairment charges in certain circumstances, which could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
Entergy reviews long-lived assets held in all of its business segments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of these assets is uncertain. Generally, the determination of recoverability is based on the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the operations of such assets. Projected net cash flows depend on the future operating costs associated with the assets, the efficiency and availability of the assets and generating units, and the future market and price for energy and capacity over the remaining life of the assets. In particular, the assets of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to impairment if adverse market conditions arise and continue (such as expected long-term declines in market prices for electricity), if adverse regulatory events occur (including with respect to environmental regulation), if there is a reduction in the expected remaining useful life of a unit, if a unit ceases operation or if a unit&#8217;s operating license is not renewed. Moreover, the failure of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows, an unfavorable change in forecasted operating results or cash flows, or a decline in observable industry market multiples could all result in potential impairment charges for the affected assets. 
As discussed in the &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities &#32;- Property &#8221; &#32; section in Part I, Item 1, the original expiration dates of the operating licenses for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 were 2013 and 2015, respectively (see discussion above regarding the continued operation of Indian Point 2 and 3 past the license expiration dates),and are currently the subject of license renewal processes at the NRC and the state in which the plants operate. On August 27, 2013, Entergy announced its plan to close and decommission Vermont Yankee. Vermont Yankee ceased power production in the fourth quarter 2014 at the end of a fuel cycle. This decision was approved by the Board in August 2013, and resulted in the recognition of impairment charges in 2013 and 2014. In October 2015, Entergy determined that it will close the Pilgrim and FitzPatrick plants. The Pilgrim plant will cease operations no later than June 1, 2019. FitzPatrick is expected to shut down at the end of its current fuel cycle, planned for January 27, 2017. During the third quarter 2015, Entergy recorded impairment and other related charges to write down the carrying values of the FitzPatrick and Pilgrim plants and related assets to their fair values. In addition, in the fourth quarter 2015, Entergy recorded impairment and other related charges to write down the carrying value of the Palisades plant and related assets to their fair value. In addition to the impairments and other related charges, Entergy has incurred severance and employee retention costs and expects to incur additional charges from 2016 into mid-2019 relating to the decisions to shut down Vermont Yankee, FitzPatrick, and Pilgrim. If Entergy concludes that any of its nuclear power plants is unlikely to operate through its current useful life, which conclusion would be based on a variety of factors, such a conclusion could result in an impairment of part or all of the carrying value of the plant. Any impairment charge taken by Entergy with respect to its long-lived assets, including the power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, would likely be material in the quarter that the charge is taken and could otherwise have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. For further information regarding evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32;- Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries. 
General Business 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 
Entergy and the Utility operating companies depend on access to the capital markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could make it more difficult to handle future contingencies such as natural disasters or substantial increases in gas and fuel prices. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and the cost of capital. 
Entergy&#8217;s business is capital intensive and dependent upon its ability to access capital at reasonable rates and other terms. At times there are also spikes in the price for natural gas and other commodities that increase the liquidity requirements of the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. In addition, Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather-related or unforeseen disaster similar to that experienced in Entergy&#8217;s service territory with Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in 2005, Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike in 2008, and Hurricane Isaac in 2012. The occurrence of one or more contingencies, including a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel or purchased power costs or storm restoration costs, higher than expected pension contributions, an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines, less cash flow from operations than expected, or other unknown events, such as future storms, could cause the financing needs of Entergy and its subsidiaries to increase. In addition, accessing the debt capital markets more frequently in these situations may result in an increase in leverage. Material leverage increases could negatively affect the credit ratings of Entergy and the Utility operating companies, which in turn could negatively affect access to the capital markets. 
The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively affect Entergy and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to maintain and to expand their businesses. Events beyond Entergy&#8217;s control, such as the volatility and disruption in global capital and credit markets in 2008 and 2009, may 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
create uncertainty that could increase its cost of capital or impair its ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on its bank credit facilities. Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their credit facilities as they come up for renewal. Moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. If Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could impact their ability to grow their businesses, decrease earnings, significantly reduce financial flexibility and/or limit Entergy Corporation&#8217;s ability to sustain its current common stock dividend level. 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) 
A downgrade in Entergy Corporation &#8217; s or its subsidiaries &#8217; credit ratings could negatively affect Entergy Corporation &#8217; s and its subsidiaries &#8217; ability to access capital and/or could require Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries to post collateral, accelerate certain payments, or repay certain indebtedness. 
There are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for each of Entergy Corporation and the Registrant Subsidiaries, including each Registrant&#8217;s regulatory framework, ability to recover costs and earn returns, diversification and financial strength and liquidity. If one or more rating agencies downgrade Entergy Corporation&#8217;s, any of the Utility operating companies&#8217;, or System Energy&#8217;s ratings, particularly below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and cash or letter of credit collateral demands may be triggered by the terms of a number of commodity contracts, leases, and other agreements. 
Most of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; large customers, suppliers, and counterparties require sufficient creditworthiness to enter into transactions. If Entergy Corporation&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; ratings decline, particularly below investment grade, or if certain counterparties believe Entergy Corporation or the Utility operating companies are losing creditworthiness and demand adequate assurance under fuel, gas, and purchased power contracts, the counterparties may require posting of collateral in cash or letters of credit, prepayment for fuel, gas or purchased power or accelerated payment, or counterparties may decline business with Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2015, based on power prices at that time, Entergy had liquidity exposure of $142 million under the guarantees in place supporting Entergy Wholesale Commodities transactions and $14 million of posted cash collateral. In the event of a decrease in Entergy Corporation&#8217;s credit rating to below investment grade, based on power prices as of December 31, 2015, Entergy would have been required to provide approximately $52 million of additional cash or letters of credit under some of the agreements. In the event of a decrease in the credit ratings of Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies to below investment grade, those companies collectively could be required to provide up to $50 million of additional cash or letters of credit to MISO. As of December 31, 2015, the liquidity exposure associated with Entergy Wholesale Commodities assurance requirements, including return of previously received collateral from counterparties, would increase by $98 million for a $1 per MMBtu increase in gas prices in both the short- and long-term markets. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to successfully complete strategic transactions, including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring or other strategic transactions, is subject to significant risks, including the risk that required regulatory or governmental approvals may not be obtained, risks relating to unknown or undisclosed problems or liabilities, and the risk that for these or other reasons, Entergy and its subsidiaries may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that they anticipate from such transactions. 
From time to time, Entergy and its subsidiaries have pursued and may continue to pursue strategic transactions including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring or other strategic transactions. In particular, as discussed in the &#8220;Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital - Union Power Station Purchase Agreement&#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries, certain of Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries have entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the Union Power Station, consisting 
of four natural gas-fired, combined-cycle gas turbine power blocks, each rated at 495 MW (summer rating), from Union Power Partners, L.P. This transaction is subject to regulatory approval and other material conditions or contingencies. The failure to complete this transaction or any future strategic transaction successfully or on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on Entergy&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations and the market&#8217;s perception of Entergy&#8217;s ability to execute its strategy. Further, this transaction, and any completed or future strategic transactions, involve substantial risks, including the following: 
acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels; 
acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate; 
Entergy and/or its subsidiaries may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to them, that exceed their estimates, or for which their rights to indemnification from the seller are limited; 
Entergy and/or its subsidiaries may be unable to obtain the necessary regulatory or governmental approvals to close a transaction, such approvals may be granted subject to terms that are unacceptable to them, or Entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve anticipated regulatory treatment of any such transaction or acquired business or assets; and 
Entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that they anticipate from the transaction, or such benefits may be delayed or may not occur at all. 
The construction of, and capital improvements to, power generation facilities involve substantial risks. Should construction or capital improvement efforts be unsuccessful, the financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies could be materially affected. 
Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; ability to complete construction of power generation facilities in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. These variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise and escalating costs for materials, labor, and environmental compliance. Delays in obtaining permits, shortages in materials and qualified labor, suppliers and contractors not performing as required under their contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, poor quality initial cost estimates from contractors, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel costs, or materials costs, downward changes in the economy, changes in law or regulation, including environmental compliance requirements, and other events beyond the control of the Utility operating companies or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost, and performance of these projects. If these projects are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, Entergy and the Utility operating companies could incur additional costs and termination payments, or face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project. In addition, the Utility operating companies could be exposed to higher costs and market volatility, which could affect cash flow and cost recovery, should their respective regulators decline to approve the construction of new generation needed to meet the reliability needs of customers at the lowest reasonable cost. For further information regarding capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital in connection with the potential construction of additional generation supply sources within the Utility operating companies&#8217; service territory, and as to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see the &#8220; Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of the Registrant Subsidiaries. 
The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters. 
The businesses in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation by local, state, and federal authorities. These laws and regulations affect the manner in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business conduct their operations and make capital expenditures. These laws and regulations also affect how the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business manage air emissions, discharges to water, wetlands impacts, solid and hazardous waste storage and disposal, cooling 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
and service water intake, the protection of threatened and endangered species, hazardous materials transportation, and similar matters. Federal, state, and local authorities continually revise these laws and regulations, and the laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and to the permitting and enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. Developing and implementing plans for facility compliance with these requirements can lead to capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures. Violations of these requirements can subject the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties&#8217; claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. In addition, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business potentially are subject to liability under these laws for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned or operated by the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. The Utility operating companies are currently involved in proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been released and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance. 
Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury, particulates, greenhouse gases, and other regulated air emissions from generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulation, controls and mitigation expenses. In addition, existing air regulations and programs promulgated by the EPA often are challenged legally, sometimes resulting in large-scale changes to anticipated regulatory regimes and the resulting need to shift course, both operationally and economically, depending on the nature of the changes. Risks relating to global climate change, initiatives to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions, and water availability issues are discussed below. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if Entergy and its subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, the operation of its facilities could be stopped or become subject to additional costs. For further information regarding environmental regulation and environmental matters, see the &#8220; Regulation of Entergy &#8217; s Business &#32; &#8211; Environmental Regulation &#8221; section of Part I, Item 1. 
The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs related to reliability standards. 
Entergy&#8217;s business is subject to extensive and mandatory reliability standards. Such standards, which are established by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), the SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC), and other regional enforcement entities, are approved by the FERC and frequently are reviewed, amended, and supplemented. Failure to comply with such standards could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of such standards. The standards, as well as the laws and regulations that govern them, are subject to judicial interpretation and to the enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. In addition to exposure to civil penalties and fines, the Utility operating companies have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to compliance with new and existing reliability standards, including costs associated with the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system and generation assets. The changes to the reliability standards applicable to the electric power industry are ongoing, and Entergy cannot predict the ultimate effect that the reliability standards will have on its Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 
The effects of weather and economic conditions, and the related impact on electricity and gas usage, may materially affect the Utility operating companies &#8217; results of operations. 
Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenues, and temperatures below moderate levels in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenues. As a corollary, moderate temperatures tend to decrease usage of energy and resulting revenues. Seasonal pricing differentials, coupled with higher consumption levels, typically cause the Utility operating companies to report higher revenues in the third quarter of the fiscal year than in the other quarters. Extreme weather conditions or storms, however, may stress the Utility operating companies&#8217; generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on their ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. These extreme conditions could have a material effect on the Utility operating companies&#8217; financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
Entergy&#8217;s electricity sales volumes are affected by a number of factors, including the state of the national and regional economies, weather, customer bill sizes (large bills tend to induce conservation), trends in energy efficiency, and the willingness and ability of large industrial customers to develop co-generation facilities that greatly reduce their demand from Entergy. Some of these factors are inherently cyclical or temporary in nature, such as the weather or economic conditions, and rarely have a long-lasting impact on Entergy&#8217;s operating results. Others, such as the increasing adoption of energy efficient appliances and building codes, are having a more permanent impact of reducing sales growth rates from historical norms. Newer technologies such as distributed generation have not yet had a substantive impact on Entergy&#8217;s electricity sales, but further advances have the potential to do so in the future. Entergy&#8217;s industrial sales, in particular, benefit from steady economic growth and favorable commodity prices and are also sensitive to changes in conditions in the markets in which its customers operate. Any negative change in any of these factors has the potential to result in slower sales growth or sales declines and increased bad debt expense, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
The effects of climate change and environmental and regulatory obligations intended to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions or to place a price on greenhouse gas emissions could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. 
In an effort to address climate change concerns, federal, state, and local authorities are calling for additional laws and regulations aimed at known or suspected causes of climate change. For example, in response to the United States Supreme Court&#8217;s 2007 decision holding that the EPA has authority to regulate emissions of CO2 and other &#8220;greenhouse gases&#8221; under the Clean Air Act, the EPA, various environmental interest groups, and other organizations are focusing considerable attention on CO2 emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. In 2010, EPA promulgated its first regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from certain vehicles and from new and significantly modified stationary sources of emissions, including electric generating units. During 2012 and 2014, EPA proposed CO2 emission standards for new and existing sources; EPA finalized these standards in 2015. As examples of state action, in the Northeast, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) establishes a cap on CO2 emissions from electric power plants and requires generators to purchase emission permits to cover their CO2 emissions, and a similar program has been developed in California. 
Developing and implementing plans for compliance with greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing facilities and proposed projects; moreover, long-term planning to meet environmental requirements can be negatively impacted and costs may increase to the extent laws and regulations change prior to full implementation. These requirements could, in turn, lead to changes in the planning or operations of balancing authorities or organized markets in areas where the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or Entergy Wholesale Commodities do business. Violations of such requirements may subject Entergy Wholesale Commodities and the Utility operating companies to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties&#8217; claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. To the extent Entergy believes any of these costs are recoverable in rates, however, additional material rate increases for customers could be 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
resisted by Entergy&#8217;s regulators and, in extreme cases, Entergy&#8217;s regulators might deny or defer timely recovery of these costs. Future changes in environmental regulation governing the emission of CO2 and other greenhouse gases could make some of Entergy&#8217;s electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the difficulty that Entergy and its subsidiaries have with obtaining or maintaining required environmental regulatory approvals, which could also materially affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of Entergy and its subsidiaries. In addition, lawsuits have occurred or are reasonably expected against emitters of greenhouse gases alleging that these companies are liable for personal injuries and property damage caused by climate change. These lawsuits may seek injunctive relief, monetary compensation, and punitive damages. 
In addition to the regulatory and financial risks associated with climate change discussed above, potential physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level, wind and storm surge damages, wetland and barrier island erosion, risks of flooding and changes in weather conditions, (such as increases in precipitation, drought, or changes in average temperatures), and potential increased impacts of extreme weather conditions or storms. Entergy subsidiaries own assets in, and serve, communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, storms, and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands. A significant portion of the nation&#8217;s oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by wetland and barrier island erosion, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes. Entergy and its subsidiaries also face the risk that climate change could impact the availability and quality of water supply necessary for operations. 
These and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on the Entergy System&#8217;s ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. Also, to the extent that climate change adversely impacts the economic health of a region or results in energy conservation or demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and revenues. Such physical or operational risks could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217;, System Energy&#8217;s, and the Utility operating companies&#8217; financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
Continued and future availability and quality of water for cooling, process, and sanitary uses could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. 
Water is a vital natural resource that is also critical to the Utility operating companies&#8217; , &#32;System Energy&#8217;s, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; business operations. Entergy&#8217;s facilities use water for cooling, boiler make-up, sanitary uses, potable supply, and many other uses. Two of Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies own and/or operate hydroelectric facilities. Accordingly, water availability and quality are critical to Entergy&#8217;s business operations. Impacts to water availability or quality could negatively impact both operations and revenues. 
Entergy secures water through various mechanisms (ground water wells, surface waters intakes, municipal supply, etc.) and operates under the provisions and conditions set forth by the provider and/or regulatory authorities. Entergy also obtains and operates in substantial compliance with water discharge permits issued under various provisions of the Clean Water Act and/or state water pollution control provisions. Regulations and authorizations for both water intake and use and for waste discharge can become more stringent in times of water shortages, low flows in rivers, low lake levels, low groundwater aquifer volumes, and similar conditions. The increased use of water by industry, agriculture, and the population at large, population growth, and the potential impacts of climate change on water resources may cause water use restrictions that affect Entergy and its subsidiaries. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity prices, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
To manage near-term financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, Entergy and its subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, may enter into contracts 
to hedge portions of their purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements, and inventories of natural gas, uranium and its conversion and enrichment, coal, refined products, and other commodities, within established risk management guidelines. As part of this strategy, Entergy and its subsidiaries may utilize fixed- and variable-price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. However, Entergy and its subsidiaries normally cover only a portion of the exposure of their assets and positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. In addition, Entergy also elects to leave certain volumes during certain years unhedged. To the extent Entergy and its subsidiaries have unhedged positions, fluctuating commodity prices can materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations and financial position. 
Although Entergy and its subsidiaries devote a considerable effort to these risk management strategies, they cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these activities. As a result of these and other factors, Entergy and its subsidiaries cannot predict with precision the impact that risk management decisions may have on their business, results of operations, or financial position. 
Entergy has guaranteed or indemnified the performance of a portion of the obligations relating to hedging and risk management activities. Reductions in Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; credit quality or changes in the market prices of energy commodities could increase the cash or letter of credit collateral required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management activities, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity and financial position. 
The Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations, which may materially affect the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
The hedging and risk management practices of the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe Entergy and its subsidiaries money, energy, or other commodities will not perform their obligations. Currently, some hedging agreements contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure all or part of their obligations to Entergy or its subsidiaries. If the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, Entergy or its subsidiaries may enforce and recover the proceeds from the credit support provided and acquire alternative hedging arrangements, which credit support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. In such event, Entergy and its subsidiaries might incur losses in addition to amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. In addition, the credit commitments of Entergy&#8217;s lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such lenders, which could materially affect the adequacy of its liquidity sources. 
The Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010 and rules and regulations promulgated under the act may adversely affect the ability of the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to utilize certain commodity derivatives for hedging and mitigating commercial risk. 
The Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, which was enacted on July 21, 2010 as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Act), and the rules and regulations promulgated under the act impose governmental regulation on the over-the-counter derivative market, including the commodity swaps used by the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to hedge and mitigate commercial risk. Under the Act, certain swaps are subject to mandatory clearing and exchange trading requirements. Swap dealers and major market participants in the swap market are subject to capital, margin, registration, reporting, recordkeeping, and business conduct requirements with respect to their swap activities. Entergy is not a swap dealer or a major swap participant, and does not expect to qualify as either in the future. Non-swap dealers and non-major swap participants, such as Entergy, are subject to reporting, recordkeeping, and business conduct requirements (i.e., anti-manipulation, anti-disruptive trading practices, and whistleblower provisions) with respect to their swap activities. Position limits may also apply to certain swaps activities. Position limit rules promulgated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission were vacated by the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission has subsequently proposed new position limit rules. If the Commodity Futures Trading Commission&#8217;s issues final position limit rules, those rules may apply to certain of Entergy&#8217;s swaps activities. 
The Act required the applicable regulators, which in the case of commodity swaps will be the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to engage in substantial rulemaking in order to implement the provisions of the Act and such rulemaking has been largely completed. Both the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business currently utilize commodity swaps to hedge and mitigate commodity price risk. It is not known whether the Act and regulations promulgated under the Act will have an adverse effect upon the market for the commodity swaps used by the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. However, to the extent that the Act and regulations promulgated under the Act have the effect of increasing the price of such commodity swaps or limiting or reducing the availability of such commodity swaps, whether through the imposition of additional capital, margin, or compliance costs upon market participants, the imposition of position limits, or otherwise, the financial performance of the Utility operating companies and/or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may be adversely affected. To the extent that the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may be required to post margin in connection with existing or future commodity swaps in addition to any margin currently posted by such entities, such entities may need to secure additional sources of capital to meet such liquidity needs or cease utilizing such commodity swaps. 
Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require additional funding and result in increased benefit plan costs. 
The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under Entergy&#8217;s pension and postretirement benefit plans. A decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements relating to Entergy&#8217;s benefit plan liabilities and also result in higher benefit costs. As the value of the assets decreases, the &#8220;expected return on assets&#8221; component of benefit costs decreases, resulting in higher benefits costs. Additionally, asset losses are incorporated into benefit costs over time, thus increasing benefits costs. Volatility in the capital markets has affected the market value of these assets, which may affect Entergy&#8217;s planned levels of contributions in the future. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Entergy&#8217;s pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding and recognition of higher liability carrying costs. The funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans can also increase as a result of changes in, among other factors, retirement rates, life expectancy assumptions, or Federal regulations. For further information regarding Entergy&#8217;s pension and other postretirement benefit plans, refer to the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32; &#8211; Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of its Registrant Subsidiaries and Note 11 to the financial statements. 
The litigation environment in the states in which certain Entergy subsidiaries operate poses a significant risk to those businesses. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, asbestos, hazardous material and ratepayer matters, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters. The states in which the Utility operating companies operate, in particular Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, have proven to be unusually litigious environments. Judges and juries in these states have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort cases. Entergy and its subsidiaries use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against them, but the litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk. 
Domestic or international terrorist attacks, including cyber attacks, and failures or breaches of Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; technology systems may adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s results of operations. 
As power generators and distributors, Entergy and its subsidiaries face heightened risk of an act or threat of terrorism, including physical and cyber attacks, either as a direct act against one of Entergy&#8217;s generation facilities, transmission operations centers, or distribution infrastructure used to manage and transport power to customers. An actual act could affect Entergy&#8217;s ability to operate, including its ability to operate the information technology systems and network infrastructure on which it relies to conduct its business. The Utility operating companies also face heightened risk of an act or threat by cyber criminals, intent on accessing personal information for the purpose of committing identity theft. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure in accordance with prescriptive standards. Despite the implementation of multiple layers of security by Entergy and its subsidiaries, technology systems remain vulnerable to potential threats that could lead to unauthorized access or loss of availability to critical systems essential to the reliable operation of Entergy&#8217;s electric system. If Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; technology systems were compromised and unable to recover timely to a normal state of operations, Entergy or its subsidiaries may be unable to perform critical business functions that are essential to the company&#8217;s well-being and the health, safety, and security needs of its customers. In addition, an attack on its information technology infrastructure may result in a loss of its confidential, sensitive, and proprietary information, including personal information of its customers, employees, vendors, and others in Entergy&#8217;s care. 
If any such attacks, failures or breaches were to occur, Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The risk of such attacks, failures, or breaches may cause Entergy and the Utility operating companies to incur increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for its nuclear power plants and other facilities, such as additional physical facility security and additional security personnel, and for systems to protect its information technology and network infrastructure systems. Such events may also expose Entergy to an increased risk of judgments and fines. 
Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact Entergy&#8217;s, the Utility operating companies&#8217;, and System Energy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes. These judgments include provisions for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. Entergy and its subsidiaries also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. Changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by Entergy and its subsidiaries could negatively affect Entergy&#8217;s, the Utility operating companies&#8217;, and System Energy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. For further information regarding Entergy&#8217;s income taxes, refer to Note 3 to the financial statements. 
(Entergy New Orleans) 
The effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers may adversely affect Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s results of operations and liquidity. 
Gas rates charged to retail gas customers are comprised primarily of purchased gas cost charges, which provide no return or profit to Entergy New Orleans, and distribution charges, which provide a return or profit to the utility. Distribution charges are affected by the amount of gas sold to customers. Purchased gas cost charges, which comprise most of a customer&#8217;s bill and may be adjusted monthly, represent gas commodity costs that Entergy New Orleans recovers from its customers. Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s cash flows can be affected by differences between the time period when gas is purchased and the time when ultimate recovery from customers occurs. When purchased gas cost charges increase substantially reflecting higher gas procurement costs incurred by Entergy New Orleans, customer 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
usage may decrease, especially in weaker economic times, resulting in lower distribution charges for Entergy New Orleans, which could adversely affect results of operations. 
(System Energy) 
System Energy owns and operates a single nuclear generating facility, and it is dependent on affiliated companies for all of its revenues. 
System Energy&#8217;s operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% ownership/leasehold interest in Grand Gulf. Charges under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are paid by the Utility operating companies as consideration for their respective entitlements to receive capacity and energy. The useful economic life of Grand Gulf is finite and is limited by the terms of its operating license, which is currently due to expire on November 1, 2024. System Energy filed in October 2011 an application with the NRC for an extension of Grand Gulf&#8217;s operating license to 2044. System Energy&#8217;s financial condition depends both on the receipt of payments from the Utility operating companies under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and on the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf. 
For information regarding the Unit Power Sales Agreement, the sale and leaseback transactions and certain other agreements relating to the Entergy System companies&#8217; support of System Energy (including the Capital Funds Agreement), see the &#8220; Grand Gulf-Related Agreements &#8221; section of Note 8 to the financial statements and the &#8220; Sale and Leaseback Transactions &#8221; section of Note 10 to the financial statements, and the &#8220; Utility &#32;- System Energy and Related Agreements &#8221; section of Part I, Item 1. 
(Entergy Corporation) 
As a holding company, Entergy Corporation depends on cash distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock. 
Entergy Corporation is a holding company with no material revenue generating operations of its own or material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, all of its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. Entergy Corporation&#8217;s ability to satisfy its financial obligations, including the payment of interest and principal on its outstanding debt, and to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the payment to it of dividends or distributions by its subsidiaries. The payments of dividends or distributions to Entergy Corporation by its subsidiaries in turn depend on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings, and on any applicable legal, regulatory, or contractual limitations on subsidiaries&#8217; ability to pay such dividends or distributions. Provisions in the organizational documents, indentures for debt issuances, and other agreements of certain of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s subsidiaries restrict the payment of cash dividends to Entergy Corporation. For further information regarding dividend or distribution restrictions to Entergy Corporation, see the &#8220; Retained Earnings and Dividend Restrictions &#8221; section of Note 7 to the financial statements.

RISK FACTORS 
Investors should review carefully the following risk factors and the other information in this Form 10-K. The risks that Entergy faces are not limited to those in this section. There may be additional risks and uncertainties (either currently unknown or not currently believed to be material) that could adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. See &#8220; FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION .&#8221; 
Utility Regulatory Risks 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) 
The terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the Utility operating companies and System Energy are determined through regulatory approval proceedings that are lengthy and subject to appeal that could result in delays in effecting rate changes and uncertainty as to ultimate results. 
The rates that the Utility operating companies and System Energy charge reflect their capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, allowed rates of return, financing costs, and related costs of service. These rates significantly influence the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and each of the Utility operating companies and System Energy. These rates are determined in regulatory proceedings and are subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. 
In addition, regulators can initiate proceedings to investigate the prudence of costs in the Utility operating companies&#8217; base rates and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of the companies&#8217; operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures (including storm costs and costs associated with capital projects), allowed rates of return and rate base, proposed resource acquisitions, and previously incurred capital expenditures that the operating companies seek to place in rates. The regulators can disallow costs subject to their jurisdiction found not to have been prudently incurred or found not to have been incurred in compliance with applicable tariffs, creating some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or reduce rates. The proceedings generally have long timelines, are primarily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited in scope or duration by statute. The length of the proceedings can cause the Utility operating companies and System Energy to experience regulatory lag in recovering costs through rates. Decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings. 
The base rates of Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Texas are established in traditional base rate case proceedings. Entergy Arkansas recovers fuel and purchased energy and certain non-fuel costs through other APSC-approved tariffs. Entergy Mississippi infrequently has traditional base rate cases, although one was filed and settled in 2014. More commonly, it obtains base rate adjustments through its formula rate plan, which operates annually. In the event that this formula rate plan were terminated, Entergy Mississippi would at that time revert to the more traditional rate case environment. 
In January 2013, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana&#8217;s and Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s then-existing formula rate plans expired, and each company filed full rate cases in February 2013. As part of the rate cases that Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed, each company requested that the LPSC approve new formula rate plans. In December 2013 the LPSC voted to approve a settlement that provides for the continued use, through the test year 2016 filing, of formula rate plans by Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s formula rate plan changes are capped at a cumulative total of $30 million through the formula rate plan cycle. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has no cap but is not permitted to increase rates prior to the test year 2015 filing. As part of the settlement, both companies established mechanisms to recover non-fuel MISO-related costs calculated separately from the formula rate plan requirements, but embedded in the formula rate plan factor applied on customer bills. MISO fuel and energy-related costs are recoverable in Entergy Gulf States Louisiana&#8217;s and Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s fuel adjustment 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
clauses. The formula rate plans continue to retain exceptions from the rate cap/restrictions and sharing requirements for certain large capital investment projects, including the Ninemile 6 generating facility. In the event that these formula rate plans were terminated, or expire without renewal or extension, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana would at that time revert to the more traditional rate case environment. Additionally, in September 2014, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC a joint application seeking to combine the two companies. In connection with this request, the companies are also seeking to combine the formula rate plans approved for each company into a single formula rate plan with a single combined-company filing for 2014. Most of the provisions under the existing separate formula rate plans would be retained under the combined formula rate plan. Further, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans have filed with the Council of the City of New Orleans a joint application seeking authorization to transfer certain assets of Entergy Louisiana used to serve the Fifteenth Ward of New Orleans (commonly referred to as Algiers) to Entergy New Orleans. Entergy New Orleans has operated under a formula rate plan that ended with the 2011 test year and has not yet been extended. If no formula rate plan is approved going forward, Entergy New Orleans will continue operating in the more traditional rate case environment. 
The Utility operating companies and System Energy, and the energy industry as a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments, and an upward trend in spending, especially with respect to infrastructure investments, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future and could result in more frequent rate cases and requests for, and the continuation of, cost recovery mechanisms. For information regarding rate case proceedings and formula rate plans applicable to certain of the Utility operating companies, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 
The Utility operating companies recover fuel, purchased power, and associated costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or disallowance in regulatory proceedings. 
The Utility operating companies recover their fuel, purchased power, and associated costs from their customers through rate mechanisms subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. Because regulatory review can result in the disallowance of incurred costs found not to have been prudently incurred with the possibility of refunds to ratepayers, there exists some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulators can initiate proceedings to investigate the continued usage or the adequacy and operation of the fuel and purchased power recovery clauses of the Utility operating companies. 
The Utility operating companies&#8217; cash flows can be negatively affected by the time delays between when gas, power, or other commodities are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers of the costs in rates. On occasion, when the level of incurred costs for fuel and purchased power rises very dramatically, some of the Utility operating companies may agree to defer recovery of a portion of that period&#8217;s fuel and purchased power costs for recovery at a later date, which could increase the near-term working capital and borrowing requirements of those companies. For a description of fuel and purchased power recovery mechanisms and information regarding the regulatory proceedings for fuel and purchased power costs recovery, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 
As a result of a challenge by the LPSC, the manner in which the Utility operating companies have traditionally shared the costs associated with coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating resources has been changed by the FERC, a development which has had and could continue to require adjustment of retail and wholesale rates in the jurisdictions where the Utility operating companies provide service and has introduced additional uncertainty in the ratemaking process. 
The Utility operating companies historically have engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating resources and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which is a rate schedule that has been approved by the FERC. In 2005 the FERC issued a decision requiring changes to the cost allocation methodology used in that rate schedule. 
In 2007 through 2012, payments were made by Entergy Arkansas to certain of the Utility operating companies in compliance with the 2005 FERC decision on the cost allocation methodology, and in 2013 and 2014, payments were made by Entergy Texas to Entergy New Orleans. There have been challenges to the level and timing of payments 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
made by Entergy Arkansas under the FERC&#8217;s decision and the prudence of the Utility operating companies&#8217; production costs. The ability to recover in rates any changes to the cost allocation resulting from the challenges, and timing of such recovery, could be uncertain and could be the subject of additional regulatory and other proceedings. For information regarding these and other proceedings associated with the System Agreement, as well as additional information regarding the System Agreement itself, see Note 2 to financial statements, System Agreement Cost Equalization Proceedings . &#160; The outcome and timing of these FERC proceedings and resulting recovery and impact on rates cannot be predicted at this time. 
The withdrawal and notices of withdrawal of certain Utility operating companies from the System Agreement create uncertainty regarding the System Agreement and the effect of the absence of such an arrangement on the Utility operating companies. 
Entergy Arkansas&#8217;s participation in the System Agreement terminated in December 2013, and Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s participation in the System Agreement is scheduled to terminate in November 2015. 
In October 2013, the Utility operating companies filed at the FERC seeking to shorten to 60 months the provision in the System Agreement that requires a Utility operating company seeking to withdraw from the System Agreement to provide 96 months advance notice of termination of participation. In October 2013, Entergy Texas provided its notice to the other Utility operating companies to terminate its participation in the System Agreement after expiration of the proposed 60-month notice period or such other period as approved by the FERC. Subsequently, Entergy Texas filed its notice to terminate its participation in the System Agreement at FERC in October 2013. In January 2014, the LPSC directed Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to provide no later than February 15, 2014 notice of their intention to terminate their participation in the System Agreement, and to use their reasonable best efforts to achieve a consensual resolution permitting early termination of the System Agreement. Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana provided notice of their termination on February 14, 2014. Accordingly, there is uncertainty regarding the continuation of the System Agreement and the effect of the absence of such an arrangement on the Utility operating companies. 
For further information regarding the regulatory proceedings relating to the System Agreement, see the &#8220; Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation &#32;- Federal Regulation &#32;- System Agreement &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries. 
The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the MISO markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs. The operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system pursuant to the MISO RTO tariff and their participation in the MISO RTO&#8217;s wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 
On December 19, 2013, the Utility operating companies integrated into the MISO RTO. For further information regarding the FERC and proceedings related to the MISO RTO, see the &#8220; Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation &#32;- Federal Regulation - Entergy&#8217;s Integration Into the MISO Regional Transmission Organization &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries. MISO maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and administers wholesale energy and ancillary services markets for market participants in the MISO region, including the Utility operating companies. The Utility operating companies sell capacity, energy, and ancillary services on a bilateral basis to certain wholesale customers and offer available electricity production of their generating facilities into the MISO day-ahead and real-time energy markets pursuant to the MISO tariff and market rules. The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the MISO markets. MISO tariff rules and system conditions, including transmission congestion, could affect the Utility operating companies&#8217; ability to sell power in certain regions and/or the economic value of such sales, and MISO market rules may change in ways, including the implementation of competition among transmission providers, that cause additional risk. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
The Utility operating companies participate in the MISO regional transmission planning process and are subject to risks associated with planning decisions that MISO makes in the exercise of control over the planning of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission assets that are under MISO&#8217;s functional control. The Utility operating companies pay transmission rates that reflect the cost of transmission projects that the Utility operating companies do not own, which could increase cash or financing needs. The terms and conditions of the MISO tariff, including provisions related to the design and implementation of wholesale markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs, are subject to regulation by FERC. The operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system pursuant to the MISO tariff and their participation in the MISO wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 
A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred as a result of severe weather could have material effects on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather. 
Entergy&#8217;s and its Utility operating companies&#8217; results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition can be materially affected by the destructive effects of severe weather. Severe weather can also result in significant outages for the customers of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, reduced revenues for the Utility operating companies during the period of the outages. A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred or revenues lost as a result of severe weather could have a material effect on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather. 
Nuclear Operating and Regulatory Risks 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States &#160; Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy) 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities must consistently operate their nuclear power plants at high capacity factors in order to be successful, and lower capacity factors could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Nuclear capacity factors significantly affect the results of operations of certain Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. Nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs. Consequently, to be successful, a plant owner must consistently operate its nuclear power plants at high capacity factors. For the Utility operating companies that own nuclear plants, lower capacity factors can increase production costs by requiring the affected companies to generate additional energy, sometimes at higher costs, from their fossil facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy their supply needs. For the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants, lower capacity factors directly affect revenues and cash flow from operations. Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; forward sales are comprised of various hedge products, many of which have some degree of operational-contingent price risk. Certain unit-contingent contracts guarantee specified minimum capacity factors. In the event plants with these contracts were operating below the guaranteed capacity factors, Entergy would be subject to price risk for the undelivered power. Further, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear forward sales contracts can also be on a firm LD basis, which subjects Entergy to increasing price risk as capacity factors decrease. Many of these firm hedge products have damages risk, capped through the use of risk management products. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners periodically shut down their nuclear power plants to replenish fuel. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such refueling outages. If refueling outages last longer than anticipated or if unplanned outages arise, Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Outages at nuclear power plants to replenish fuel require the plant to be &#8220;turned off.&#8221; Refueling outages generally are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months and average approximately 30 days in duration. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such planned outages. When refueling outages last longer than anticipated or a plant experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease and maintenance costs may increase. Lower than forecasted capacity factors may cause Entergy Wholesale Commodities to experience reduced revenues and may also create damages risk with certain hedge products as previously discussed. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities face risks related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication), and the risk of being unable to effectively manage these risks by purchasing from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Based upon currently planned fuel cycles, Entergy&#8217;s nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what Entergy believes are reasonably predictable prices through most of 2015. Entergy&#8217;s ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners and enrichers. While there are a number of possible alternate suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, the pricing of any such alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time. Entergy also may draw upon its own inventory intended for later generation periods, depending upon its risk management strategy at that time. Entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S. Market prices for nuclear fuel have been extremely volatile from time to time in the past. Although Entergy&#8217;s nuclear fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against market risks for several years, costs for nuclear fuel in the future cannot be predicted with certainty due to normal inherent market uncertainties, and price increases could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
Entergy&#8217;s ability to assure nuclear fuel supply also depends upon the performance and reliability of conversion, enrichment, and fabrication services providers. These service providers are fewer in number than uranium suppliers. For conversion and enrichment services, Entergy diversifies its supply by supplier and country and may take special measures to ensure a reliable supply of enriched uranium for fabrication into nuclear fuel. For fabrication services, each plant is dependent upon the performance of the fabricator of that plant&#8217;s nuclear fuel; therefore, Entergy relies upon additional monitoring, inspection, and oversight of the fabrication process to assure reliability and quality of its nuclear fuel. Certain of the suppliers and service providers are located in or dependent upon countries, such as Russia, in which deteriorating economic conditions or international sanctions could restrict the ability of such suppliers to continue to supply fuel or provide such services. The inability of such suppliers or service providers to perform such obligations could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business face the risk that the NRC will change or modify its regulations or suspend or revoke their licenses, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Under the Atomic Energy Act and Energy Reorganization Act, the NRC regulates the operation of nuclear power plants. The NRC may modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, related regulations, or the terms of the licenses for nuclear facilities. A change in the Atomic Energy Act, other applicable statutes, or the applicable regulations or licenses may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and could materially affect the results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition of Entergy (through Entergy Wholesale Commodities), its Utility operating companies, or System Energy. Events at nuclear plants owned by others, as well as those owned by one of these companies, may cause the NRC to initiate such actions. As a result, if an incident were to occur at any nuclear generating unit, whether an Entergy nuclear generating unit or not, it could materially affect 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or Entergy Wholesale Commodities. For example, the earthquake of March 11, 2011 that affected the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plants in Japan resulted in the NRC issuing three orders effective on March 12, 2012 requiring U.S. nuclear operators, including Entergy, to undertake plant modifications or perform additional analyses that will, among other things, result in increased capital and operating costs associated with operating Entergy&#8217;s nuclear plants, some of which could be material. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities are exposed to risks and costs related to operating and maintaining their nuclear power plants, and their failure to maintain operational efficiency at their nuclear power plants could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
The nuclear generating units owned by certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, &#160; and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business began commercial operations in the 1970s-1980s. Older equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating efficiently. This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages, or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in reduced profitability. Operations at any of the nuclear generating units owned and operated by Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries could degrade to the point where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. If this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. A decision may be made to close a unit rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the unit to full capacity. For Entergy Wholesale Commodities, this could result in lost revenue and increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments and penalties for failure to perform under their contracts with customers. Moreover, Entergy is becoming more dependent on fewer suppliers for key parts of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants that may need to be replaced or refurbished. In addition, certain major parts have long lead-times to manufacture if an unplanned replacement is needed. This dependence on a reduced number of suppliers and long lead-times on certain major parts for unplanned replacements could result in delays in obtaining qualified replacement parts and, therefore, greater expense for Entergy. 
The costs associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, as well as the costs of and their ability to fully decommission their nuclear power plants, could be significantly affected by the timing of the opening of a spent nuclear fuel disposal facility, as well as interim storage and transportation requirements. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants incur costs on a periodic basis for the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. The approval of a license for a national repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, such as the one proposed for Yucca Mountain, Nevada, or any interim storage facility, and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. For example, while the DOE is required by law to proceed with the licensing of Yucca Mountain and, after the license is granted by the NRC, to construct the repository and commence the receipt of spent fuel, the Obama administration has expressed its intention and taken specific steps to discontinue the Yucca Mountain project and study a new spent fuel strategy. These actions may prolong the time before spent fuel is removed from Entergy&#8217;s plant sites. Because the DOE has not accomplished its objectives, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts, and Entergy has sued the DOE for such breach. Furthermore, Entergy is uncertain as to when the DOE plans to commence acceptance of spent fuel from its facilities for storage or disposal. As a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at the companies&#8217; nuclear sites. The costs of on-site storage are also affected by regulatory requirements for such storage. In addition, the availability of a repository or other off-site storage facility for spent nuclear fuel may affect the ability to fully decommission the nuclear units and the costs relating to decommissioning. For further information regarding spent fuel storage, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32;&#8211; Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#32;&#8211; Spent Fuel Disposal &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to pay substantial retrospective premiums imposed under the Price-Anderson Act in the event of a nuclear incident, and losses not covered by insurance could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. 
Accidents and other unforeseen problems at nuclear power plants have occurred both in the United States and elsewhere. The Price-Anderson Act limits each reactor owner&#8217;s public liability (off-site) for a single nuclear incident to the payment of retrospective premiums into a secondary insurance pool of up to approximately $127.318 million per reactor. With 104 reactors currently participating, this translates to a total public liability cap of approximately $13.241 billion per incident. The limit is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation, a change in the primary limit of insurance coverage, and changes in the number of licensed reactors. As required by the Price-Anderson Act, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities carry the maximum available amount of primary nuclear off-site liability insurance with American Nuclear Insurers (currently $375 million for each operating site). Claims for any nuclear incident exceeding that amount are covered under the retrospective premiums paid into the secondary insurance pool. As a result, in the event of a nuclear incident that causes damages (off-site) in excess of the $375 million in primary insurance coverage, each owner of a nuclear plant reactor, including Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident, will be required to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the $375 million primary level, up to a maximum of $127.318 million per reactor per incident (Entergy&#8217;s maximum total contingent obligation per incident is $1.4 billion). The retrospective premium payment is currently limited to $18.963 million per year per incident per reactor until the aggregate public liability for each licensee is paid up to the $127.318 million cap. 
NEIL is a utility industry mutual insurance company, owned by its members. All member plants could be subject to an annual assessment (retrospective premium of up to 10 times current annual premium for all policies) should the surplus (reserve) be significantly depleted due to &#160; insured losses. As of April 1, 2014, the maximum annual assessment amounts total $105.7 million for the Utility plants and $126.4 million for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants. Retrospective Premium Insurance available through NEIL&#8217;s reinsurance treaty can cover the potential assessments. The Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants currently maintain the Retrospective Premium Insurance to cover this potential assessment. 
As an owner of nuclear power plants, Entergy participates in industry self-insurance programs and could be liable to fund claims should a plant owned by a different company experience a major event. Any resulting liability from a nuclear accident may exceed the applicable primary insurance coverage and require contribution of additional funds through the industry-wide program that could significantly affect the results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries. 
Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of assets in the decommissioning trusts, which then could require significant additional funding. 
Owners of nuclear generating plants have an obligation to decommission those plants. Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants maintain decommissioning trust funds for this purpose. Certain of the Utility operating companies collect funds from their customers, which are deposited into the trusts covering the units operated for or on behalf of those companies. Those rate collections are based upon operating license lives as well as estimated trust fund earnings and decommissioning costs. In connection with the acquisition of certain nuclear plants, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners also acquired decommissioning trust funds that are funded in accordance with NRC regulations. Assets in these trust funds are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns that may fall below projected return rates, and may result in losses resulting from the recognition of impairments of the value of certain securities held in these trust funds. As part of the Pilgrim, Indian Point 1 and 2, Vermont Yankee, and Palisades/Big Rock Point purchases, the former owners transferred decommissioning trust funds, along with the liability to decommission the plants, to the 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
respective Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant owners. In addition, the former owner of Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick retained the decommissioning trusts and related liability to decommission these plants, but has the right to require the respective Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners to assume the decommissioning liability provided that it assigns the funds in the corresponding decommissioning trust, up to a specified level, to such owners. Alternatively, the former owner may contract with Entergy Nuclear, Inc. for the decommissioning work at a price equal to the funds in the corresponding decommissioning trust up to a specified amount. As part of the Indian Point 1 and 2 purchase, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant owner also funded an additional $25 million to a supplemental decommissioning trust fund. As part of the Palisades transaction, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business assumed responsibility for spent fuel at the decommissioned Big Rock Point nuclear plant, which is located near Charlevoix, Michigan. Once the spent fuel is removed from the site, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business will dismantle the spent fuel storage facility and complete site decommissioning. The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business expects to fund this activity from operating revenue, and Entergy is providing $5 million in credit support to provide financial assurance to the NRC for this obligation. 
In 2008, Entergy experienced declines in the market value of assets held in the trust funds for meeting its decommissioning funding assurance obligations for its plants. This decline adversely affected Entergy&#8217;s ability to demonstrate compliance with the NRC&#8217;s requirements for providing financial assurance for decommissioning funding for some of its plants, which deficiencies have now been corrected. An early plant shutdown, poor investment results or higher than anticipated decommissioning costs could cause trust fund assets to be insufficient to meet the decommissioning obligations, with the result that the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. For further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32; &#8211; Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 9 to the financial statements. 
Changes in NRC regulations or other binding regulatory requirements may cause increased funding requirements for nuclear plant decommissioning trusts. 
NRC regulations require certain minimum financial assurance requirements for meeting obligations to decommission nuclear power plants. Those financial assurance requirements may change from time to time, and certain changes may result in a material increase in the financial assurance required for decommissioning the Utility operating companies&#8217;, System Energy&#8217;s and owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants. Such changes could result in the need for additional contributions to decommissioning trusts, or the posting of parent guarantees, letters of credit, or other surety mechanisms. For further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32; &#8211; Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 9 to the financial statements. 
New or existing safety concerns regarding operating nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel could lead to restrictions upon the operation of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants. 
New and existing concerns are being expressed in public forums about the safety of nuclear generating units and nuclear fuel, in particular in the northeastern United States, which is where five of the six units in the current fleet of Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are located. These concerns have led to, and are expected to continue to lead to, various proposals to Federal regulators and governing bodies in some localities where Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries own nuclear generating units for legislative and regulatory changes that could lead to the shutdown of nuclear units, denial of license renewal applications, restrictions on nuclear units as a result of unavailability of sites for spent nuclear fuel storage and disposal, or other adverse effects on owning and operating nuclear generating units. Entergy vigorously responds to these concerns and proposals. If any of the existing proposals, or any proposals that may arise in the future with respect to legislative and regulatory changes, become effective, they could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B

(Entergy Corporation) 
A failure to obtain renewed licenses or other approvals required for the continued operation of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and could lead to an increase in depreciation rates or an acceleration of the timing for the funding of decommissioning obligations. 
The license renewal and related processes for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants have been and may continue to be the subject of significant public debate and regulatory and legislative review and scrutiny at the federal and, in certain cases, state level. The original expiration date of the operating license for Indian Point 2 was September 2013 and the original expiration date of the operating license for Indian Point 3 is December 2015. Because these plants filed timely license renewal applications, the NRC&#8217;s rules provide that these plants may continue to operate under their existing operating licenses until their renewal applications have been finally determined. Various parties have expressed opposition to renewal of these licenses. Renewal of the Indian Point licenses is the subject of ongoing proceedings before the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) of the NRC and, with respect to issues resolved by the ASLB, before the NRC on appeal. 
In relation to Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has taken the position that these plant owners must obtain a new state-issued Clean Water Act Section 401 water quality certification as part of the license renewal process. In addition, before the NRC may issue renewed operating licenses it must resolve its obligation to address the requirements of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA). Most commonly, those requirements are met by the applicant's demonstration that the activity authorized by the federal permit being sought is consistent with the host state's federally-approved coastal management policies. Entergy has undertaken three independent initiatives to resolve CZMA issues: ""grandfathering,"" ""previous review,"" and a ""consistency certification."" In December 2014 the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, issued a unanimous ruling stating that Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 &#8220;are exempt from New York&#8217;s Coastal Management Program.&#8221; That decision could be appealed. For further information regarding these environmental regulations see the &#8220; Regulation of Entergy's Business &#32;- Environmental Regulation - Clean Water Act &#8221; section in Part I, Item 1. 
If the NRC finally denies the applications for the renewal of operating licenses for one or more of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, or a state in which any such nuclear power plant is located is able to prevent the continued operation of such plant, Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected by loss of revenue and cash flow associated with the plant or plants, potential impairments of the carrying value of the plants, increased depreciation rates, and an accelerated need for decommissioning funds, which could require additional funding. In addition, Entergy may incur increased operating costs depending on any conditions that may be imposed in connection with license renewal. For further discussion regarding the license renewal processes for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, see the &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities Authorizations to Operate Its Nuclear Plants &#8221; in Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis. 
The decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants owned by Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may not be adequate to meet decommissioning obligations if one or more of their nuclear power plants is retired earlier than the anticipated shutdown date, the plants cost more to decommission than estimated, or if current regulatory requirements change, which then could require additional funding. 
Under NRC regulations, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear subsidiaries are permitted to project the NRC-required decommissioning amount, based on an NRC formula or a site-specific estimate, and the amount in each of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant&#8217;s decommissioning trusts combined with other decommissioning financial assurances in place. The projections are made based on the operating license expiration date and the mid-point of the subsequent decommissioning process, or the anticipated actual completion of decommissioning if a site-specific estimate is used, for each of these nuclear power plants. As a result, if the projected amount of individual plants&#8217; decommissioning trusts exceeds the NRC-required decommissioning amount, then its 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
decommissioning obligations are considered to be funded in accordance with NRC regulations. If the projected costs do not sufficiently reflect the actual costs the applicable Entergy subsidiaries would be required to incur to decommission these nuclear power plants, and funding is otherwise inadequate, or if the formula or site-specific estimate is changed to require increased funding, additional resources would be required. Furthermore, depending upon the level of funding available in the trust funds, the NRC may not permit the trust funds to be used to pay for related costs such as the management of spent nuclear fuel that are not included in the NRC&#8217;s formula. The NRC may also require a plan for the provision of separate funding for spent fuel management costs. In addition to NRC requirements, there are other decommissioning-related obligations for certain of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, which management believes it will be able to satisfy. 
If any Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiary decides to shut down one of its nuclear power plants earlier than the scheduled shutdown date and conduct decommissioning without the benefit of a safe storage period, the applicable Entergy subsidiary may be unable to rely upon only the decommissioning trust to fund the entire decommissioning obligations, which would require it to obtain funding from other sources. 
Vermont Yankee submitted notification of permanent cessation of operations and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor in January 2015 after final shutdown in December 2014. The Post Shutdown Decommissioning Activities Report for Vermont Yankee, including a site specific cost estimate, was submitted to the NRC in December 2014. Vermont Yankee&#8217;s future certifications to satisfy the NRC&#8217;s financial assurance requirements will now be based on the site specific cost estimate, including the estimated cost of managing spent fuel, rather than the NRC minimum formula for estimating decommissioning costs. Entergy expects that amounts available in Vermont Yankee&#8217;s decommissioning trust fund, including expected earnings, together with the credit facilities entered into in January 2015 that are expected to be repaid with recoveries from DOE litigation related to spent fuel storage, will be sufficient to cover expected costs of decommissioning, spent fuel management costs, and site restoration. Filings with the NRC for planned shutdown activities will determine whether any other financial assurance may be required and will specifically address funding for spent fuel management, which will be required until the federal government takes possession of the fuel and removes it from the site, per its current obligation. 
Further, federal or state regulatory changes, including mandated increases in decommissioning funding or changes in the methods or standards for decommissioning operations, may also increase the funding requirements of, or accelerate the timing for funding of, the obligations related to the decommissioning of Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants. As a result, under any of these circumstances, Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially affected. 
Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are exposed to price risk. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries do not have a regulator-authorized rate of return on their capital investments in non-utility businesses. In particular, the sale of capacity and energy from the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, unless otherwise contracted, is subject to the fluctuation of market power prices. In order to reduce future price risk to desired levels, Entergy Wholesale Commodities utilizes contracts that are unit-contingent and Firm LD and various products such as forward sales, options, and collars. As of December 31, 2014, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear power generation plants had sold forward 86%, 74%, 39%, 17%, and 19% of its generation portfolio&#8217;s planned energy output for 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. 
Market conditions such as product cost, market liquidity, and other portfolio considerations influence the product and contractual mix. The obligations under unit-contingent agreements depend on a generating asset that is operating; if the generation asset is not operating, the seller generally is not liable for damages. For some unit-contingent obligations, however, there is also a guarantee of availability that provides for the payment to the power purchaser of contract damages, if incurred, in the event the unit owner fails to deliver power as a result of the failure of the specified generation unit to generate power at or above a specified availability threshold. Firm LD sales transactions may be exposed to substantial operational price risk, a portion of which may be capped through the use of risk management products, to the extent that the plants do not run as expected and market prices exceed contract prices. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Market prices may fluctuate substantially, sometimes over relatively short periods of time, and at other times experience sustained increases or decreases. Demand for electricity and its fuel stock can fluctuate dramatically, creating periods of substantial under- or over-supply. During periods of over-supply, prices might be depressed. Also, from time to time there may be political pressure, or pressure from regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over wholesale and retail energy commodity and transportation rates, to impose price limitations, credit requirements, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address volatility and other issues in these markets. 
The price that different counterparties offer for various products including forward sales is influenced both by market conditions as well as the contract terms such as damage provisions, credit support requirements, and the number of available counterparties interested in contracting for the desired forward period. Depending on differences between market factors at the time of contracting versus current conditions, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; contract portfolio may have average contract prices above or below current market prices, including at the expiration of the contracts, which may significantly affect Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. New hedges are generally layered into on a rolling forward basis, which tends to drive hedge over-performance to market in a falling price environment, and hedge underperformance to market in a rising price environment; however, hedge timing, product choice, and hedging costs will also affect these results. See the &#8220; Results of Operations &#32;- &#32; Realized Revenue per MWh for Entergy Wholesale Commodities Nuclear Plants &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries. With operating licenses for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 expiring in 2013 and 2015, respectively (see discussion above regarding the continued operation of Indian Point 2 and 3 past the license expiration dates), and as a consequence of any delays in obtaining extension of the operating licenses and any other approvals required for continued operation of the plants, Entergy Wholesale Commodities may enter into fewer unit-contingent forward sales contracts for output from such plants for periods beyond the license expiration. 
Among the factors that could affect market prices for electricity and fuel, all of which are beyond Entergy&#8217;s control to a significant degree, are: 
prevailing market prices for natural gas, uranium (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication), coal, oil, and other fuels used in electric generation plants, including associated transportation costs, and supplies of such commodities; 
seasonality and realized weather deviations compared to normalized weather forecasts; 
availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources and the requirements of a renewable portfolio standard; 
changes in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal and crude oil, and refined products; 
liquidity in the general wholesale electricity market, including the number of creditworthy counterparties available and interested in entering into forward sales agreements for Entergy&#8217;s full hedging term; 
the actions of external parties, such as the FERC and local independent system operators and other state or Federal energy regulatory bodies, that may impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in the energy markets; 
electricity transmission, competing generation or fuel transportation constraints, inoperability, or inefficiencies; 
the general demand for electricity, which may be significantly affected by national and regional economic conditions; 
weather conditions affecting demand for electricity or availability of hydroelectric power or fuel supplies; 
the rate of growth in demand for electricity as a result of population changes, regional economic conditions, and the implementation of conservation programs or distributed generation; 
regulatory policies of state agencies that affect the willingness of Entergy Wholesale Commodities customers to enter into long-term contracts generally, and contracts for energy in particular; 
increases in supplies due to actions of current Entergy Wholesale Commodities competitors or new market entrants, including the development of new generation facilities, expansion of existing generation facilities, the disaggregation of vertically integrated utilities, and improvements in transmission that allow additional supply to reach Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; nuclear markets; 
union and labor relations; 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
changes in Federal and state energy and environmental laws and regulations and other initiatives, including but not limited to, the price impacts of proposed emission controls such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI); 
changes in law resulting from federal or state energy legislation or legislation subjecting energy derivatives used in hedging and risk management transactions to governmental regulation; and 
natural disasters, terrorist actions, wars, embargoes, and other catastrophic events. 
The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative, regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 
The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulation. Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability. 
Public utilities under the Federal Power Act are required to obtain FERC acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity. Each of the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants that generates electricity, as well as Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing, LLC, is a &#8220;public utility&#8221; under the Federal Power Act by virtue of making wholesale sales of electric energy and/or owning wholesale electric transmission facilities. The FERC has granted these generating and power marketing companies the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. The FERC&#8217;s orders that grant the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; generating and power marketing companies market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if the FERC subsequently determines that the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if any of its generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority and potential penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation. If the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; generating or power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain the FERC&#8217;s acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have an adverse effect on the rates the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business charges for power from its facilities. 
The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules imposed by the existing Independent System Operators. The Independent System Operators that oversee most of the wholesale power markets impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps and other mechanisms, to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets. These types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on the profitability of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business&#8217; generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets. For further information regarding federal, state and local laws and regulation applicable to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see the &#8220; Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business &#8221; &#32;section in Part I, Item 1. 
The regulatory environment applicable to the electric power industry has undergone substantial changes over the past several years as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. These changes are ongoing and Entergy cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. In addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism and have raised claims that the competitive marketplace is not working because energy prices in wholesale markets exceed the marginal cost of operating nuclear power plants, as well as proposals to re-regulate the markets, impose a generation tax, or require divestitures by generating companies to reduce their market share. Other 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process, which could require material changes to business planning models. If competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, modified, discontinued, or delayed, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected. 
The power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to impairment charges in certain circumstances, which could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
Entergy reviews long-lived assets held in all of its business segments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of these assets is uncertain. Generally, the determination of recoverability is based on the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the operations of such assets. Projected net cash flows depend on the future operating costs associated with the assets, the efficiency and availability of the assets and generating units, and the future market and price for energy and capacity over the remaining life of the assets. In particular, the assets of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to impairment if adverse market conditions arise and continue (such as expected long-term declines in market prices for electricity), if adverse regulatory events occur (including with respect to environmental regulation), if a unit ceases operation or if a unit&#8217;s operating license is not renewed. Moreover, the failure of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows, an unfavorable change in forecasted operating results or cash flows, or a decline in observable industry market multiples could all result in potential impairment charges for the affected assets. 
As discussed in the &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities &#32;- Property&#8221; section in Part I, Item 1, the original expiration dates of the operating licenses for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 are 2013 and 2015, respectively (see discussion above regarding the continued operation of Indian Point 2 and 3 past the license expiration dates),and are currently the subject of license renewal processes at the NRC and the state in which the plants operate. On August 27, 2013, Entergy announced its plan to close and decommission Vermont Yankee. Vermont Yankee ceased power production in the fourth quarter 2014 at the end of a fuel cycle. This decision was approved by the Board in August 2013, and resulted in the recognition of impairment charges in 2013 and 2014. If Entergy concludes that any of its nuclear power plants is unlikely to operate through its current useful life, which conclusion would be based on a variety of factors, such a conclusion could result in an impairment of part or all of the carrying value of the plant. Any impairment charge taken by Entergy with respect to its long-lived assets, including the power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, would likely be material in the quarter that the charge is taken and could otherwise have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. For further information regarding evaluating long-lived assets for impairment, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32;- Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries. 
General Business 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 
Entergy and the Utility operating companies depend on access to the capital markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could make it more difficult to handle future contingencies such as natural disasters or substantial increases in gas and fuel prices. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and the cost of capital. 
Entergy&#8217;s business is capital intensive and dependent upon its ability to access capital at reasonable rates and other terms. At times there are also spikes in the price for natural gas and other commodities that increase the liquidity requirements of the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. In addition, Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather- 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
related or unforeseen disaster similar to that experienced in Entergy&#8217;s service territory with Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in 2005, Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike in 2008, and Hurricane Isaac in 2012. The occurrence of one or more contingencies, including a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel or purchased power costs or storm restoration costs, higher than expected pension contributions, an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines, less cash flow from operations than expected, or other unknown events, such as future storms, could cause the financing needs of Entergy and its subsidiaries to increase. In addition, accessing the debt capital markets more frequently in these situations may result in an increase in leverage. Material leverage increases could negatively affect the credit ratings of Entergy and the Utility operating companies, which in turn could negatively affect access to the capital markets. 
The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively affect Entergy and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to maintain and to expand their businesses. Events beyond Entergy&#8217;s control, such as the volatility and disruption in global capital and credit markets in 2008 and 2009, may create uncertainty that could increase its cost of capital or impair its ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on its bank credit facilities. Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their credit facilities as they come up for renewal. Moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. If Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could impact their ability to grow their businesses, decrease earnings, significantly reduce financial flexibility and/or limit Entergy Corporation&#8217;s ability to sustain its current common stock dividend level. 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) 
A downgrade in Entergy Corporation &#8217; s or its subsidiaries &#8217; credit ratings could negatively affect Entergy Corporation &#8217; s and its subsidiaries &#8217; ability to access capital and/or could require Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries to post collateral, accelerate certain payments, or repay certain indebtedness. 
There are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for each of Entergy Corporation and the Registrant Subsidiaries, including each Registrant&#8217;s regulatory framework, ability to recover costs and earn returns, diversification and financial strength and liquidity. If one or more rating agencies downgrade Entergy Corporation&#8217;s, any of the Utility operating companies&#8217;, or System Energy&#8217;s ratings, particularly below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and cash or letter of credit collateral demands may be triggered by the terms of a number of commodity contracts, leases, and other agreements. 
Most of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; large customers, suppliers, and counterparties require sufficient creditworthiness to enter into transactions. If Entergy Corporation&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; ratings decline, particularly below investment grade, or if certain counterparties believe Entergy Corporation or the Utility operating companies are losing creditworthiness and demand adequate assurance under fuel, gas, and purchased power contracts, the counterparties may require posting of collateral in cash or letters of credit, prepayment for fuel, gas or purchased power or accelerated payment, or counterparties may decline business with Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2014, based on power prices at that time, Entergy had liquidity exposure of $159 million under the guarantees in place supporting Entergy Wholesale Commodities transactions and $5 million of posted cash collateral. In the event of a decrease in Entergy Corporation&#8217;s credit rating to below investment grade, based on power prices as of December 31, 2014, Entergy would have been required to provide approximately $51 million of additional cash or letters of credit under some of the agreements. As of December 31, 2014, the liquidity exposure associated with Entergy Wholesale Commodities assurance requirements, including return of previously posted collateral from counterparties, would increase by $52 million for a $1 per MMBtu increase in gas prices in both the short- and long-term markets. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Entergy and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to successfully complete strategic transactions, including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring or other strategic transactions, is subject to significant risks, including the risk that required regulatory or governmental approvals may not be obtained, risks relating to unknown or undisclosed problems or liabilities, and the risk that for these or other reasons, Entergy and its subsidiaries may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that they anticipate from such transactions. 
From time to time, Entergy and its subsidiaries have pursued and may continue to pursue strategic transactions including merger, acquisition, divestiture, joint venture, restructuring or other strategic transactions. In particular, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, two of Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, are undertaking a transaction that would result in the combination of those entities into a single public utility. In addition, as discussed in the &#8220;Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital - Union Power Station Purchase Agreement&#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries, certain of Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries have entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the Union Power Station, consisting of four natural gas-fired, combined-cycle gas turbine power blocks, each rated at 495 MW (summer rating), from Union Power Partners, L.P. Each of these transactions is subject to regulatory approval and other material conditions or contingencies. The failure to complete these transactions or any future strategic transaction successfully or on a timely basis could have an adverse effect on Entergy&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations and the market&#8217;s perception of Entergy&#8217;s ability to execute its strategy. Further, these transactions, and any completed or future strategic transactions, involve substantial risks, including the following: 
acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels; 
acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate; 
Entergy and/or its subsidiaries may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to them, that exceed their estimates, or for which their rights to indemnification from the seller are limited; 
Entergy and/or its subsidiaries may be unable to obtain the necessary regulatory or governmental approvals to close a transaction, such approvals may be granted subject to terms that are unacceptable to them, or Entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve anticipated regulatory treatment of any such transaction or acquired business or assets; and 
Entergy or its subsidiaries otherwise may be unable to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that they anticipate from the transaction, or such benefits may be delayed or may not occur at all. 
The construction of, and capital improvements to, power generation facilities involve substantial risks. Should construction or capital improvement efforts be unsuccessful, the financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies could be materially affected. 
Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; ability to complete construction of power generation facilities in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. These variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise and escalating costs for materials, labor, and environmental compliance. Delays in obtaining permits, shortages in materials and qualified labor, suppliers and contractors not performing as required under their contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, poor quality initial cost estimates from contractors, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel costs, or materials costs, downward changes in the economy, changes in law or regulation, including environmental compliance requirements, and other events beyond the control of the Utility operating companies or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost, and performance of these projects. If these projects are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, Entergy and the Utility operating companies could incur additional costs and termination payments, or face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project. For further information regarding capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital in connection with the potential construction of additional generation supply sources within the Utility operating companies&#8217; service territory, and as to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see the &#8220; Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of the Registrant Subsidiaries. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters. 
The businesses in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation by local, state, and federal authorities. These laws and regulations affect the manner in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business conduct their operations and make capital expenditures. These laws and regulations also affect how the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business manage air emissions, discharges to water, wetlands impacts, solid and hazardous waste storage and disposal, cooling and service water intake, the protection of threatened and endangered species, hazardous materials transportation, and similar matters. Federal, state, and local authorities continually revise these laws and regulations, and the laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and to the permitting and enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. Developing and implementing plans for facility compliance with these requirements can lead to capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures. Violations of these requirements can subject the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties&#8217; claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. In addition, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business potentially are subject to liability under these laws for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned or operated by the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. The Utility operating companies are currently involved in proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been released and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance. 
Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury, particulates, greenhouse gases, and other regulated air emissions from generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulation, controls and mitigation expenses. In addition, existing air regulations and programs promulgated by the EPA often are challenged legally, sometimes resulting in large-scale changes to anticipated regulatory regimes and the resulting need to shift course, both operationally and economically, depending on the nature of the changes. Risks relating to global climate change, initiatives to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions, and water availability issues are discussed below. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if Entergy and its subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, the operation of its facilities could be stopped or become subject to additional costs. For further information regarding environmental regulation and environmental matters, see the &#8220; Regulation of Entergy &#8217; s Business &#32; &#8211; Environmental Regulation &#8221; section of Part I, Item 1. 
The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs related to reliability standards. 
Entergy&#8217;s business is subject to extensive and mandatory reliability standards. Such standards, which are established by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), the SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC), and other regional enforcement entities, are approved by the FERC and frequently are reviewed, amended, and supplemented. Failure to comply with such standards could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of such standards. The standards, as well as the laws and regulations that govern them, are subject to judicial interpretation and to the enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. In addition to exposure to civil penalties and fines, the Utility operating companies have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to compliance with new and existing reliability standards, including costs associated with the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system and generation assets. The changes to the 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
reliability standards applicable to the electric power industry are ongoing, and Entergy cannot predict the ultimate effect that the reliability standards will have on its Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 
The effects of weather and economic conditions, and the related impact on electricity and gas usage, may materially affect the Utility operating companies &#8217; results of operations. 
Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenues, and temperatures below moderate levels in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenues. As a corollary, moderate temperatures tend to decrease usage of energy and resulting revenues. Seasonal pricing differentials, coupled with higher consumption levels, typically cause the Utility operating companies to report higher revenues in the third quarter of the fiscal year than in the other quarters. Extreme weather conditions or storms, however, may stress the Utility operating companies&#8217; generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on their ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. These extreme conditions could have a material effect on the Utility operating companies&#8217; financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
Entergy&#8217;s electricity sales volumes are affected by a number of factors, including the state of the national and regional economies, weather, customer bill sizes (large bills tend to induce conservation), trends in energy efficiency, and the willingness and ability of large industrial customers to develop co-generation facilities that greatly reduce their demand from Entergy. Some of these factors are inherently cyclical or temporary in nature, such as the weather or economic conditions, and rarely have a long-lasting impact on Entergy&#8217;s operating results. Others, such as the increasing adoption of energy efficient appliances and building codes, are having a more permanent impact of reducing sales growth rates from historical norms. Newer technologies such as distributed generation have not yet had a substantive impact on Entergy&#8217;s electricity sales, but further advances have the potential to do so in the future. Since the national economy emerged from the last recession in 2009, Entergy&#8217;s industrial sales in particular have benefited from steady economic growth and relatively low natural gas prices from an historical perspective. Any substantial negative change in any of these factors has the potential to result in slower or declining sales growth and increased bad debt expense, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
The effects of climate change and environmental and regulatory obligations intended to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions or to place a price on greenhouse gas emissions could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. 
In an effort to address climate change concerns, federal, state, and local authorities are calling for additional laws and regulations aimed at known or suspected causes of climate change. For example, in response to the United States Supreme Court&#8217;s 2007 decision holding that the EPA has authority to regulate emissions of CO2 and other &#8220;greenhouse gases&#8221; under the Clean Air Act, the EPA, various environmental interest groups, and other organizations are focusing considerable attention on CO2 emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. In 2010, EPA promulgated its first regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from certain vehicles and from new and significantly modified stationary sources of emissions, including electric generating units. In 2012 and 2013, EPA proposed a CO2 emission standard for new sources; this standard is expected to be finalized in 2015. Additionally, EPA proposed a CO2 existing source performance standard regulation in 2014 for finalization in 2015. As examples of state action, in the Northeast, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) establishes a cap on CO2 emissions from electric power plants and requires generators to purchase emission permits to cover their CO2 emissions, and a similar program has been developed in California. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Developing and implementing plans for compliance with greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing facilities and proposed projects; moreover, long-term planning to meet environmental requirements can be negatively impacted and costs may increase to the extent laws and regulations change prior to full implementation. Violations of such requirements may subject Entergy Wholesale Commodities and the Utility operating companies to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties&#8217; claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. To the extent Entergy believes any of these costs are recoverable in rates, however, additional material rate increases for customers could be resisted by Entergy&#8217;s regulators and, in extreme cases, Entergy&#8217;s regulators might deny or defer timely recovery of these costs. Future changes in environmental regulation governing the emission of CO2 and other greenhouse gases could make some of Entergy&#8217;s electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the difficulty that Entergy and its subsidiaries have with obtaining or maintaining required environmental regulatory approvals, which could also materially affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of Entergy and its subsidiaries. In addition, lawsuits currently are pending or are reasonably expected against emitters of greenhouse gases alleging that these companies are liable for personal injuries and property damage caused by climate change. These lawsuits may seek injunctive relief, monetary compensation, and punitive damages. 
In addition to the regulatory and financial risks associated with climate change discussed above, physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level, wind and storm surge damages, wetland and barrier island erosion, risks of flooding and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation, drought, average temperatures, and potential increased impacts of extreme weather conditions or storms. Entergy subsidiaries own assets in, and serve, communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, storms, and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands. A significant portion of the nation&#8217;s oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by wetland and barrier island erosion, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes. Entergy and its subsidiaries also face the risk that climate change could impact the availability and quality of water supply necessary for operations. 
These and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on the Entergy System&#8217;s ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. Also, to the extent that climate change adversely impacts the economic health of a region or results in energy conservation or demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and revenues. Such physical or operational risks could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217;, System Energy&#8217;s, and the Utility operating companies&#8217; financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
Continued and future availability and quality of water for cooling, process, and sanitary uses could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. 
Water is a vital natural resource that is also critical to the Utility operating companies&#8217; , &#32;System Energy's, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217; business operations. Entergy&#8217;s facilities use water for cooling, boiler make-up, sanitary uses, potable supply, and many other uses. Two of Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies own and/or operate hydroelectric facilities. Accordingly, water availability and quality are critical to Entergy&#8217;s business operations. Impacts to water availability or quality could negatively impact both operations and revenues. 
Entergy secures water through various mechanisms (ground water wells, surface waters intakes, municipal supply, etc.) and operates under the provisions and conditions set forth by the provider and/or regulatory authorities. Entergy also obtains and operates in substantial compliance with water discharge permits issued under various provisions of the Clean Water Act. Regulations and authorizations for both water intake and use and for waste discharge can become more stringent in times of water shortages, low flows in rivers, low lake levels, low groundwater 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
aquifer volumes, and similar conditions. The increased use of water by industry, agriculture, and the population at large, population growth, and the potential impacts of climate change on water resources may cause water use restrictions that affect Entergy and its subsidiaries. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity prices, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
To manage near-term financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, Entergy and its subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, may enter into contracts to hedge portions of their purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements, and inventories of natural gas, uranium and its conversion and enrichment, coal, refined products, and other commodities, within established risk management guidelines. As part of this strategy, Entergy and its subsidiaries may utilize fixed- and variable-price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. However, Entergy and its subsidiaries normally cover only a portion of the exposure of their assets and positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. In addition, Entergy also elects to leave certain volumes during certain years unhedged. To the extent Entergy and its subsidiaries have unhedged positions, fluctuating commodity prices can materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations and financial position. 
Although Entergy and its subsidiaries devote a considerable effort to these risk management strategies, they cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these activities. As a result of these and other factors, Entergy and its subsidiaries cannot predict with precision the impact that risk management decisions may have on their business, results of operations, or financial position. 
Entergy has guaranteed or indemnified the performance of a portion of the obligations relating to hedging and risk management activities. Reductions in Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; credit quality or changes in the market prices of energy commodities could increase the cash or letter of credit collateral required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management activities, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity and financial position. 
The Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations, which may materially affect the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
The hedging and risk management practices of the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe Entergy and its subsidiaries money, energy, or other commodities will not perform their obligations. Currently, some hedging agreements contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure all or part of their obligations to Entergy or its subsidiaries. If the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, Entergy or its subsidiaries may enforce and recover the proceeds from the credit support provided and acquire alternative hedging arrangements, which credit support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. In such event, Entergy and its subsidiaries might incur losses in addition to amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. In addition, the credit commitments of Entergy&#8217;s lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such lenders, which could materially affect the adequacy of its liquidity sources. 
The Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010 and rules and regulations promulgated under the act may adversely affect the ability of the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to utilize certain commodity derivatives for hedging and mitigating commercial risk. 
The Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, which was enacted on July 21, 2010 as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Act), and the rules and regulations promulgated under the act impose governmental regulation on the over-the-counter derivative market, including the commodity 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
swaps used by the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to hedge and mitigate commercial risk. Under the Act, certain swaps are subject to mandatory clearing and exchange trading requirements. Swap dealers and major market participants in the swap market are subject to capital, margin, registration, reporting, recordkeeping, and business conduct requirements with respect to their swap activities. Entergy is not a swap dealer or a major swap participant, and does not expect to qualify as either in the future. Non-swap dealers and non-major swap participants, such as Entergy, are subject to reporting, recordkeeping, and business conduct requirements (i.e., anti-manipulation, anti-disruptive trading practices, and whistleblower provisions) with respect to their swap activities. Position limits may also apply to certain swaps activities. Position limit rules promulgated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission were vacated by the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has subsequently proposed new position limit rules. If the Commodity Futures Trading Commission&#8217;s issues final position limit rules, those rules may apply to certain of Entergy&#8217;s swaps activities. 
The Act required the applicable regulators, which in the case of commodity swaps will be the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to engage in substantial rulemaking in order to implement the provisions of the Act and such rulemaking has been largely completed. Both the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business currently utilize commodity swaps to hedge and mitigate commodity price risk. It is not known whether the Act and regulations promulgated under the Act will have an adverse effect upon the market for the commodity swaps used by the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. However, to the extent that the Act and regulations promulgated under the Act have the effect of increasing the price of such commodity swaps or limiting or reducing the availability of such commodity swaps, whether through the imposition of additional capital, margin, or compliance costs upon market participants, the imposition of position limits, or otherwise, the financial performance of the Utility operating companies and/or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may be adversely affected. To the extent that the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may be required to post margin in connection with existing or future commodity swaps in addition to any margin currently posted by such entities, such entities may need to secure additional sources of capital to meet such liquidity needs or cease utilizing such commodity swaps. 
Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require additional funding. 
The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under Entergy&#8217;s pension and postretirement benefit plans. A decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements relating to Entergy&#8217;s benefit plan liabilities. Volatility in the capital markets has affected the market value of these assets, which may affect Entergy&#8217;s planned levels of contributions in the future. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Entergy&#8217;s pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. The funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans can also increase as a result of changes in, among other factors, retirement rates, life expectancy assumptions, or Federal regulations. For further information regarding Entergy&#8217;s pension and other postretirement benefit plans, refer to the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32; &#8211; Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of its Registrant Subsidiaries and Note 11 to the financial statements. 
The litigation environment in the states in which certain Entergy subsidiaries operate poses a significant risk to those businesses. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, asbestos, hazardous material and ratepayer matters, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters. The states in which the Utility operating companies operate, in particular Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, have proven to be unusually litigious environments. Judges and juries in these states have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
business tort cases. Entergy and its subsidiaries use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against them, but the litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk. 
Domestic or international terrorist attacks, including cyber attacks, and failures or breaches of Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; technology systems may adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s results of operations. 
As power generators and distributors, Entergy and its subsidiaries face heightened risk of an act or threat of terrorism, including physical and cyber attacks, either as a direct act against one of Entergy&#8217;s generation facilities, transmission operations centers, or distribution infrastructure used to manage and transport power to customers. An actual act could affect Entergy&#8217;s ability to operate the necessary information technology systems and network infrastructure. The Utility operating companies also face heightened risk of an act or threat by cyber criminals, intent on accessing personal information for the purpose of committing identity theft. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure in accordance with prescriptive standards. Despite the implementation of multiple layers of security by Entergy and its subsidiaries, technology systems remain vulnerable to potential threats that could lead to unauthorized access or loss of availability to critical systems essential to the reliable operation of Entergy&#8217;s electric system. If Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; technology systems were compromised and unable to recover timely to a normal state of operations, Entergy or its subsidiaries may be unable to perform critical business functions that are essential to the company&#8217;s well-being and the health, safety, and security needs of its customers. In addition, an attack on its information technology infrastructure may result in a loss of its confidential, sensitive, and proprietary information, including personal information of its customers, employees, vendors, and others in Entergy&#8217;s care. 
If any such attacks, failures or breaches were to occur, Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The risk of such attacks, failures, or breaches may cause Entergy and the Utility operating companies to incur increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for its nuclear power plants and other facilities, such as additional physical facility security and additional security personnel, and for systems to protect its information technology and network infrastructure systems. Such events may also expose Entergy to an increased risk of judgments and fines. 
Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact Entergy&#8217;s, the Utility operating companies&#8217;, and System Energy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes. These judgments include provisions for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. Entergy and its subsidiaries also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. Changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by Entergy and its subsidiaries could negatively affect Entergy&#8217;s, the Utility operating companies&#8217;, and System Energy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. For further information regarding Entergy&#8217;s income taxes, refer to Note 3 to the financial statements. 
(Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans) 
The effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers may adversely affect Entergy Gulf States Louisiana&#8217;s and Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s results of operations and liquidity. 
Gas rates charged to retail gas customers are comprised primarily of purchased gas cost charges, which provide no return or profit to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans, and distribution charges, which provide 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
a return or profit to the utility. Distribution charges are affected by the amount of gas sold to customers. Purchased gas cost charges, which comprise most of a customer&#8217;s bill and may be adjusted monthly, represent gas commodity costs that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans recovers from its customers. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana&#8217;s or Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s cash flows can be affected by differences between the time period when gas is purchased and the time when ultimate recovery from customers occurs. When purchased gas cost charges increase substantially reflecting higher gas procurement costs incurred by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans, customer usage may decrease, especially in weaker economic times, resulting in lower distribution charges for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans, which could adversely affect results of operations. 
(System Energy) 
System Energy owns and operates a single nuclear generating facility, and it is dependent on affiliated companies for all of its revenues. 
System Energy&#8217;s operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% ownership/leasehold interest in Grand Gulf. Charges under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are paid by the Utility operating companies as consideration for their respective entitlements to receive capacity and energy. The useful economic life of Grand Gulf is finite and is limited by the terms of its operating license, which is currently due to expire on November 1, 2024. System Energy filed in October 2011 an application with the NRC for an extension of Grand Gulf&#8217;s operating license to 2044. System Energy&#8217;s financial condition depends both on the receipt of payments from the Utility operating companies under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and on the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf. 
For information regarding the Unit Power Sales Agreement, the sale and leaseback transactions and certain other agreements relating to the Entergy System companies&#8217; support of System Energy (including the Capital Funds Agreement), see the &#8220; Grand Gulf-Related Agreements &#8221; section of Note 8 to the financial statements and the &#8220; Sale and Leaseback Transactions &#8221; section of Note 10 to the financial statements, and the &#8220; Utility &#32;- System Energy and Related Agreements &#8221; section of Part I, Item 1. 
(Entergy Corporation) 
As a holding company, Entergy Corporation depends on cash distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock. 
Entergy Corporation is a holding company with no material revenue generating operations of its own or material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, all of its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. Entergy Corporation&#8217;s ability to satisfy its financial obligations, including the payment of interest and principal on its outstanding debt, and to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the payment to it of dividends or distributions by its subsidiaries. The payments of dividends or distributions to Entergy Corporation by its subsidiaries in turn depend on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings, and on any applicable legal, regulatory, or contractual limitations on subsidiaries&#8217; ability to pay such dividends or distributions. Provisions in the organizational documents, indentures for debt issuances, and other agreements of certain of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s subsidiaries restrict the payment of cash dividends to Entergy Corporation. For further information regarding dividend or distribution restrictions to Entergy Corporation, see the &#8220; Retained Earnings and Dividend Restrictions &#8221; section of Note 7 to the financial statements.

RISK FACTORS 
Investors should review carefully the following risk factors and the other information in this Form 10-K. The risks that Entergy faces are not limited to those in this section. There may be additional risks and uncertainties (either currently unknown or not currently believed to be material) that could adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. See &#8220; FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION .&#8221; 
Utility Regulatory Risks 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) 
The terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the Utility operating companies and System Energy are determined through regulatory approval proceedings that are lengthy and subject to appeal that could result in delays in effecting rate changes and uncertainty as to ultimate results. 
The rates that the Utility operating companies and System Energy charge reflect their capital expenditures, operations and maintenance costs, allowed rates of return, financing costs, and related costs of service. These rates significantly influence the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and each of the Utility operating companies and System Energy. These rates are determined in regulatory proceedings and are subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. 
In addition, regulators can initiate proceedings to investigate the prudence of costs in the Utility operating companies&#8217; base rates and examine, among other things, the reasonableness or prudence of the companies&#8217; operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures (including storm costs and costs associated with capital projects), allowed rates of return and rate base, proposed resource acquisitions, and previously incurred capital expenditures that the operating companies seek to place in rates. The regulators can disallow costs subject to their jurisdiction found not to have been prudently incurred or found not to have been incurred in compliance with applicable tariffs, creating some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or reduce rates. The proceedings generally have long timelines, are primarily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited in scope or duration by statute. The length of the proceedings can cause the Utility operating companies and System Energy to experience regulatory lag in recovering costs through rates. Decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings. 
The base rates of Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Texas are established in traditional base rate case proceedings. Entergy Arkansas recovers fuel and purchased energy and certain non-fuel costs through other APSC-approved tariffs. Entergy Mississippi infrequently has traditional base rate cases. More commonly, it obtains base rate adjustments through its formula rate plan which operates annually. In the event that this formula rate plan were terminated, Entergy Mississippi would at that time revert to the more traditional rate case environment. 
In January 2013, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana&#8217;s and Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s current formula rate plans expired, and each company filed full rate cases in February 2013. As part of the rate cases that Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed, each company requested that the LPSC approve new formula rate plans. In December 2013 the LPSC voted to approve a settlement that provides for the continued use, through the test year 2016 filing, of formula rate plans by Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. Entergy Louisiana&#8217;s formula rate plan changes are capped at a cumulative total of $30 million through the formula rate plan cycle. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has no cap but is not permitted to increase rates prior to the test year 2015 filing. As part of the settlement, both companies established riders to recover non-fuel MISO-related costs separately from the formula rate plan requirements and may recover MISO fuel and energy-related costs in their fuel adjustment clauses. The formula rate plans continue to retain exceptions for certain large capital investment projects, including the Ninemile 6 generating facility. In the event that these formula rate plans were terminated, or expire without renewal or extension, Entergy 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana would at that time revert to the more traditional rate case environment. Entergy New Orleans has operated under a formula rate plan that ended with the 2011 test year and has not yet been extended. If no formula rate plan is approved going forward, Entergy New Orleans will be operating in the more traditional rate case environment. 
The Utility operating companies and System Energy, and the energy industry as a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments, and an upward trend, especially with respect to infrastructure investments, which is likely to continue in the foreseeable future and could result in more frequent rate cases and requests for, and the continuation of, cost recovery mechanisms. For information regarding rate case proceedings and formula rate plans applicable to certain of the Utility operating companies, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 
The Utility operating companies recover fuel and purchased power costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or disallowance in regulatory proceedings. 
The Utility operating companies recover their fuel and purchased power costs from their customers through rate mechanisms subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. Because regulatory review can result in the disallowance of incurred costs found not to have been prudently incurred with the possibility of refunds to ratepayers, there exists some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulators can initiate proceedings to investigate the continued usage or the adequacy and operation of the fuel and purchased power recovery clauses of the Utility operating companies. 
The Utility operating companies&#8217; cash flows can be negatively affected by the time delays between when gas, power, or other commodities are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers of the costs in rates. On occasion, when the level of incurred costs for fuel and purchased power rises very dramatically, some of the Utility operating companies may agree to defer recovery of a portion of that period&#8217;s fuel and purchased power costs for recovery at a later date, which could increase the near-term working capital and borrowing requirements of those companies. For a description of fuel and purchased power recovery mechanisms and information regarding the regulatory proceedings for fuel and purchased power costs recovery, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 
As a result of a challenge by the LPSC, the manner in which the Utility operating companies have traditionally shared the costs associated with coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating resources has been changed by the FERC, which could require adjustment of retail and wholesale rates in the jurisdictions where the Utility operating companies provide service and has introduced additional uncertainty in the ratemaking process. 
The Utility operating companies historically have engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating resources and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which is a rate schedule that has been approved by the FERC. In 2005 the FERC issued a decision requiring changes to the cost allocation methodology used in that rate schedule. 
In 2007 through 2012, payments were made by Entergy Arkansas to certain of the Utility operating companies in compliance with the 2005 FERC decision on the cost allocation methodology, and in 2013 a payment was made by Entergy Texas to Entergy New Orleans. There have been challenges to the level and timing of payments made by Entergy Arkansas under the FERC&#8217;s decision and the prudence of the Utility operating companies&#8217; production costs. The ability to recover in rates any changes to the cost allocation resulting from the challenges, and timing of such recovery, could be uncertain and could be the subject of additional regulatory and other proceedings. For information regarding these and other proceedings associated with the System Agreement, as well as additional information regarding the System Agreement itself, see Note 2 to financial statements, System Agreement Cost Equalization Proceedings . &#160; The outcome and timing of this FERC proceeding and resulting recovery and impact on rates cannot be predicted at this time. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
The withdrawal and notices of withdrawal of certain Utility operating companies from the System Agreement creates uncertainty as to the long-term viability of the System Agreement. 
Entergy Arkansas&#8217; participation in the System Agreement terminated in December 2013, and Entergy Mississippi&#8217;s participation in the System Agreement is scheduled to terminate in November 2015. 
In October 2013, the Utility operating companies filed at the FERC seeking to shorten to 60 months the provision in the System Agreement that requires a Utility operating company seeking to withdraw from the System Agreement to provide 96 months advance notice of termination of participation. In October 2013, Entergy Texas provided its notice to the other Utility operating companies to terminate its participation in the System Agreement after expiration of the proposed 60-month notice period or such other period as approved by the FERC. Subsequently, Entergy Texas filed its notice to terminate its participation in the System Agreement at FERC in October 2013. In January 2014, the LPSC directed Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to provide no later than February 15, 2014 notice of their intention to terminate their participation in the System Agreement, and to use their reasonable best efforts to achieve a consensual resolution permitting early termination of the System Agreement. Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana provided such notice on February 14, 2014. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to the long-term continued viability of the System Agreement and the effect of the absence of such an arrangement on the Utility operating companies. 
For further information regarding the regulatory proceedings relating to the System Agreement, see the &#8220; Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation &#32;- Federal Regulation &#32;- System Agreement &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries. 
The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the MISO markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs. The operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system pursuant to the MISO RTO tariff and their participation in the MISO RTO&#8217;s wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 
On December 19, 2013, the Utility operating companies integrated into the MISO RTO. For further information regarding the FERC and proceedings related to the ICT and MISO, see the &#8220; Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation &#32;- Federal Regulation - Entergy&#8217;s Integration Into the MISO Regional Transmission Organization &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries. MISO maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and administers wholesale energy and ancillary services markets for market participants in the MISO region, including the Utility operating companies. The Utility operating companies sell capacity, energy, and ancillary services on a bilateral basis to certain wholesale customers and offer available electricity production of their generating facilities into the MISO day-ahead and real-time energy markets. The Utility operating companies are subject to economic risks associated with participation in the MISO markets. RTO rules and system conditions, including transmission congestion, could affect the Utility operating companies&#8217; ability to sell power in certain markets, and RTO market rules may change in a way, including the introduction of competition among transmission providers, that causes additional risk. 
The Utility operating companies participate in the MISO regional transmission planning process and are subject to risks associated with planning decisions that MISO makes in the exercise of control over the planning of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission assets that are under MISO&#8217;s functional control. The Utility operating companies may be required to contribute to the cost of transmission projects that the Utility operating companies will not own, which could increase cash or financing needs. The terms and conditions of the MISO RTO tariff, including provisions related to the design and implementation of wholesale markets and the allocation of transmission upgrade costs, are subject to regulation by FERC. The operation of the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system pursuant to the MISO RTO tariff and their participation in the MISO RTO&#8217;s wholesale markets may be adversely affected by regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements.

A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred as a result of severe weather could have material effects on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather. 
Entergy&#8217;s and its Utility operating companies&#8217; results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition can be materially affected by the destructive effects of severe weather. Severe weather can also result in significant outages for the customers of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, reduced revenues for the Utility operating companies during the period of the outages. A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred or revenues lost as a result of severe weather could have a material effect on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather. 
Nuclear Operating and Regulatory Risks 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States &#160; Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy) 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities must consistently operate their nuclear power plants at high capacity factors in order to be successful, and lower capacity factors could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Nuclear capacity factors significantly affect the results of operations of certain Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. Nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs. Consequently, to be successful, a plant owner must consistently operate its nuclear power plants at high capacity factors. For the Utility operating companies that own nuclear plants, lower capacity factors can increase production costs by requiring the affected companies to generate additional energy, sometimes at higher costs, from their fossil facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy their supply needs. For the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants, lower capacity factors directly affect revenues and cash flow from operations. Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217;s forward sales are comprised of various hedge products, many of which have some degree of operational-contingent price risk. Certain unit-contingent contracts guarantee specified minimum capacity factors. In the event plants with these contracts were operating below the guaranteed capacity factors, Entergy would be subject to price risk for the undelivered power. Further, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217;s nuclear forward sales contracts can also be on a firm LD basis, which subjects Entergy to increasing price risk as capacity factors decrease. Many of these firm hedge products have damages risk, capped through the use of risk management products. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners periodically shut down their nuclear power plants to replenish fuel. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such refueling outages. If refueling outages last longer than anticipated or if unplanned outages arise, Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected. 
Outages at nuclear power plants to replenish fuel require the plant to be &#8220;turned off.&#8221; Refueling outages generally are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months and average approximately 30 days in duration. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such planned outages. When refueling outages last longer than anticipated or a plant experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease and maintenance costs may increase. Lower than forecasted capacity factors may cause Entergy Wholesale Commodities to experience reduced revenues and may also create damages risk with certain hedge products as previously discussed. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities face risks related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its conversion and enrichment), and the risk of being unable to effectively manage these risks by purchasing from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
Based upon currently planned fuel cycles, Entergy&#8217;s nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what Entergy believes are reasonably predictable prices through most of 2014. Entergy&#8217;s ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the performance reliability of uranium miners and enrichers. While there are a number of possible alternate suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate any supplier performance failure, the pricing of any such alternate uranium supply from the market will be dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time. Entergy also may draw upon its own inventory intended for later generation periods, depending upon its risk management strategy at that time. Entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S. Market prices for nuclear fuel have been extremely volatile from time to time in the past. Although Entergy&#8217;s nuclear fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against market risks for several years, costs for nuclear fuel in the future cannot be predicted with certainty due to normal inherent market uncertainties, and price increases could materially affect the liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business face the risk that the NRC will change or modify its regulations or suspend or revoke their licenses, which could materially affect Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
Under the Atomic Energy Act and Energy Reorganization Act, the NRC regulates the operation of nuclear power plants. The NRC may modify, suspend, or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, related regulations, or the terms of the licenses for nuclear facilities. A change in the Atomic Energy Act, other applicable statutes, or the applicable regulations or licenses may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and could materially affect the results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition of Entergy (through Entergy Wholesale Commodities), its Utility operating companies, or System Energy. Events at nuclear plants owned by others, as well as those owned by one of these companies, may cause the NRC to initiate such actions. As a result, if an incident were to occur at any nuclear generating unit, whether an Entergy nuclear generating unit or not, it could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or Entergy Wholesale Commodities. For example, the earthquake of March 11, 2011 that affected the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plants in Japan resulted in the NRC issuing three orders effective on March 12, 2012 requiring U.S. nuclear operators, including Entergy, to undertake plant modifications or perform additional analyses that will, among other things, result in increased capital and operating costs associated with operating Entergy&#8217;s nuclear plants, some of which could be material. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities are exposed to risks and costs related to operating and maintaining their nuclear power plants, and their failure to maintain operational efficiency at their nuclear power plants could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
The nuclear generating units owned by certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, &#160; and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business began commercial operations in the 1970s-1980s. Older equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating efficiently. This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages, or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in reduced profitability. Operations at any of the nuclear generating units owned and operated by Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries could degrade to the point where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. If this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. A decision may be made to close a unit rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the unit to full capacity. For Entergy Wholesale Commodities, this could result in lost revenue and increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments and penalties for failure to perform under their contracts with customers. Moreover, Entergy is becoming more dependent on fewer suppliers for key parts of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants that may need to be replaced or refurbished. In addition, 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
certain major parts have long lead-times to manufacture if an unplanned replacement is needed. This dependence on a reduced number of suppliers and long lead-times on certain major parts for unplanned replacements could result in delays in obtaining qualified replacement parts and, therefore, greater expense for Entergy. 
The costs associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, as well as the costs of and their ability to fully decommission their nuclear power plants, could be significantly affected by the timing of the opening of a spent nuclear fuel disposal facility, as well as interim storage and transportation requirements. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants incur costs on a periodic basis for the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. The approval of a license for a national repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, such as the one proposed for Yucca Mountain, Nevada, or any interim storage facility, and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. For example, while the DOE is required by law to proceed with the licensing of Yucca Mountain and, after the license is granted by the NRC, to construct the repository and commence the receipt of spent fuel, the Obama administration has expressed its intention and taken specific steps to discontinue the Yucca Mountain project and study a new spent fuel strategy. These actions may prolong the time before spent fuel is removed from Entergy&#8217;s plant sites. Because the DOE has not accomplished its objectives, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts, and Entergy has sued the DOE for such breach. Furthermore, Entergy is uncertain as to when the DOE plans to commence acceptance of spent fuel from its facilities for storage or disposal. As a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at the companies&#8217; nuclear sites. The costs of on-site storage are also affected by regulatory requirements for such storage. In addition, the availability of a repository or other off-site storage facility for spent nuclear fuel may affect the ability to fully decommission the nuclear units and the costs relating to decommissioning. For further information regarding spent fuel storage, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32;&#8211; Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#32;&#8211; Spent Fuel Disposal &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy. 
Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to pay substantial retrospective premiums imposed under the Price-Anderson Act in the event of a nuclear incident, and losses not covered by insurance could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s and their results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. 
Accidents and other unforeseen problems at nuclear power plants have occurred both in the United States and elsewhere. The Price-Anderson Act limits each reactor owner&#8217;s public liability (off-site) for a single nuclear incident to the payment of retrospective premiums into a secondary insurance pool of up to approximately $127.318 million per reactor. With 104 reactors currently participating, this translates to a total public liability cap of approximately $13.241 billion per incident . The limit is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation, a change in the primary limit of insurance coverage, and changes in the number of licensed reactors. As required by the Price-Anderson Act, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities carry the maximum available amount of primary nuclear off-site liability insurance with American Nuclear Insurers (currently $375 million for each operating site). Claims for any nuclear incident exceeding that amount are covered under the retrospective premiums paid into the secondary insurance pool. As a result, in the event of a nuclear incident that causes damages (off-site) in excess of the $375 million in primary insurance coverage, each owner of a nuclear plant reactor, including Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident, will be required to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the $375 million primary level, up to a maximum of $127.318 million per reactor per incident (Entergy&#8217;s maximum total contingent obligation per incident is $1.4 billion). The retrospective premium payment is currently limited to $18.963 million per year per incident per reactor until the aggregate public liability for each licensee is paid up to the $127.318 million cap. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
NEIL is a utility industry mutual insurance company, owned by its members. All member plants could be subject to assessments (retrospective premium of up to 10 times current annual premium for all policies) should the surplus (reserve) be significantly depleted due to &#160; insured losses. As of April 1, 2013, the maximum assessment amounts total $91.4 million for the Utility plants and $111.1 million for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants. Retrospective Premium Insurance available through NEIL&#8217;s reinsurance treaty can cover the potential assessments. The Entergy Wholesale Commodities plants currently maintain the Retrospective Premium Insurance to cover this potential assessment. 
As an owner of nuclear power plants, Entergy participates in industry self-insurance programs and could be liable to fund claims should a plant owned by a different company experience a major event. Any resulting liability from a nuclear accident may exceed the applicable primary insurance coverage and require contribution of additional funds through the industry-wide program that could significantly affect the results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries. 
Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of assets in the decommissioning trusts, which then could require significant additional funding. 
Owners of nuclear generating plants have an obligation to decommission those plants. Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants maintain decommissioning trust funds for this purpose. Certain of the Utility operating companies collect funds from their customers, which are deposited into the trusts covering the units operated for or on behalf of those companies. Those rate collections are based upon operating license lives as well as estimated trust fund earnings and decommissioning costs. In connection with the acquisition of certain nuclear plants, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners also acquired decommissioning trust funds that are funded in accordance with NRC regulations. Assets in these trust funds are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns that may fall below projected return rates, and may result in losses resulting from the recognition of impairments of the value of certain securities held in these trust funds. As part of the Pilgrim, Indian Point 1 and 2, Vermont Yankee, and Palisades/Big Rock Point purchases, the former owners transferred decommissioning trust funds, along with the liability to decommission the plants, to the respective Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant owners. In addition, the former owner of Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick retained the decommissioning trusts and related liability to decommission these plants, but has the right to require the respective Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners to assume the decommissioning liability provided that it assigns the funds in the corresponding decommissioning trust, up to a specified level, to such owners. Alternatively, the former owner may contract with Entergy Nuclear, Inc. for the decommissioning work at a price equal to the funds in the corresponding decommissioning trust up to a specified amount. As part of the Indian Point 1 and 2 purchase, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant owner also funded an additional $25 million to a supplemental decommissioning trust fund. As part of the Palisades transaction, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business assumed responsibility for spent fuel at the decommissioned Big Rock Point nuclear plant, which is located near Charlevoix, Michigan. Once the spent fuel is removed from the site, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business will dismantle the spent fuel storage facility and complete site decommissioning. The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business expects to fund this activity from operating revenue, and Entergy is providing $5 million in credit support to provide financial assurance to the NRC for this obligation. 
In 2008, Entergy experienced declines in the market value of assets held in the trust funds for meeting its decommissioning funding assurance obligations for its plants. This decline adversely affected Entergy&#8217;s ability to demonstrate compliance with the NRC&#8217;s requirements for providing financial assurance for decommissioning funding for some of its plants, which deficiencies have now been corrected. An early plant shutdown, poor investment results or higher than anticipated decommissioning costs could cause trust fund assets to be insufficient to meet the decommissioning obligations, with the result that the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. For further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32; &#8211; Nuclear

Decommissioning Costs &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 9 to the financial statements. 
Changes in NRC regulations or other binding regulatory requirements may cause increased funding requirements for nuclear plant decommissioning trusts. 
NRC regulations require certain minimum financial assurance requirements for meeting obligations to decommission nuclear power plants. Those financial assurance requirements may change from time to time, and certain changes may result in a material increase in the financial assurance required for decommissioning the Utility operating companies&#8217;, System Energy&#8217;s and owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants. Such changes could result in the need for additional contributions to decommissioning trusts, or the posting of parent guarantees, letters of credit, or other surety mechanisms. For further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, see the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32; &#8211; Nuclear Decommissioning Costs &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 9 to the financial statements. 
New or existing safety concerns regarding operating nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel could lead to restrictions upon the operation of Entergy&#8217;s nuclear power plants. 
New and existing concerns are being expressed in public forums about the safety of nuclear generating units and nuclear fuel, in particular in the northeastern United States, which is where five of the six units in the current fleet of Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are located. These concerns have led to, and are expected to continue to lead to, various proposals to Federal regulators and governing bodies in some localities where Entergy&#8217;s subsidiaries own nuclear generating units for legislative and regulatory changes that could lead to the shutdown of nuclear units, denial of license renewal applications, restrictions on nuclear units as a result of unavailability of sites for spent nuclear fuel storage and disposal, or other adverse effects on owning and operating nuclear generating units. Entergy vigorously responds to these concerns and proposals. If any of the existing proposals, or any proposals that may arise in the future with respect to legislative and regulatory changes, become effective, they could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
(Entergy Corporation) 
A failure to obtain renewed licenses or other approvals required for the continued operation of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and could lead to an increase in depreciation rates or an acceleration of the timing for the funding of decommissioning obligations. 
The license renewal and related processes for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants have been and may continue to be the subject of significant public debate and regulatory and legislative review and scrutiny at the federal and, in certain cases, state level. The original expiration dates of the operating licenses for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 are in September 2013 and December 2015, respectively. Because these plants filed timely license renewal applications, the NRC&#8217;s rules provide that these plants may continue to operate under their existing operating licenses until their renewal applications have been finally determined. Various parties have expressed opposition to renewal of these licenses. Renewal of the Indian Point licenses is the subject of ongoing proceedings before the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) of the NRC and, with respect to issues resolved by the ASLB, before the NRC on appeal. 
In relation to Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has taken the position that these plant owners must obtain a new state-issued Clean Water Act Section 401 water quality certification as part of the license renewal process. For the Indian Point plants, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners also must ensure that requirements of the Coastal Zone Management Act, which is administered in New York State primarily by the New York Department of State, are satisfied (to the extent required) prior to getting the 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
renewed licenses. For further information regarding these environmental regulations see &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities &#32; &#8211; Property &#32; &#8211; &#32; Nuclear Generating Stations &#8221; in Part I, Item 1. 
If the NRC finally denies the applications for the renewal of operating licenses for one or more of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, or a state in which any such nuclear power plant is located is able to prevent the continued operation of such plant, Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected by loss of revenue and cash flow associated with the plant or plants, potential impairments of the carrying value of the plants, increased depreciation rates, and an accelerated need for decommissioning funds, which could require additional funding. In addition, Entergy may incur increased operating costs depending on any conditions that may be imposed in connection with license renewal. For further discussion regarding the license renewal processes for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, see the &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities &#32;&#8211; Property &#32;&#8211; Nuclear Generating Stations &#8221; &#32;section &#160; in Part I, Item 1. 
The decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants owned by Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may not be adequate to meet decommissioning obligations if one or more of their nuclear power plants is retired earlier than the anticipated shutdown date, the plants cost more to decommission than estimated, or if current regulatory requirements change, which then could require additional funding. 
Under NRC regulations, Entergy&#8217;s nuclear subsidiaries are permitted to project the NRC-required decommissioning amount, based on an NRC formula or a site-specific estimate, and the amount in each of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant&#8217;s decommissioning trusts combined with other decommissioning financial assurances in place. The projections are made based on the operating license expiration date and the mid-point of the subsequent decommissioning process, or the anticipated actual completion of decommissioning if a site-specific estimate is used, for each of these nuclear power plants. As a result, if the projected amount of our decommissioning trusts exceeds the NRC-required decommissioning amount, then its decommissioning obligations are considered to be funded in accordance with NRC regulations. In the event the projected costs do not sufficiently reflect the actual costs the applicable Entergy subsidiaries would be required to incur to decommission these nuclear power plants, and funding is otherwise inadequate, or if the formula or site-specific estimate is changed to require increased funding, additional resources would be required. Furthermore, depending upon the level of funding available in the trust funds, the NRC may not permit the trust funds to be used to pay for related costs such as the management of spent nuclear fuel that are not included in the NRC's formula. The NRC may also require a plan for the provision of separate funding for spent fuel management costs. In addition to NRC requirements, there are other decommissioning-related obligations for certain of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, which management believes it will be able to satisfy. 
With respect to the decommissioning trusts for Indian Point 1 and Indian Point 2 and Palisades, the total amount in each of those trusts as of December 31, 2012 would not have been sufficient to initiate and complete the immediate near-term radiological decommissioning of the respective unit as of the license termination date of each respective plant as measured by NRC formula amounts, but rather the funds would have been sufficient to place the unit in a condition of safe storage status pending future completion of decommissioning. (By February 28, 2013, however, increases in the market value of the Palisades trusts made that fund sufficient to complete the immediate near-term radiological decommissioning of the unit as of the license termination date as measured by the NRC formula amount). For example, if an Entergy subsidiary decides to shut down and begin decommissioning one of those nuclear power plants on its license expiration date with the benefit of a safe storage period, its trust funds for the plant as of December 31, 2012 would have been insufficient and the applicable Entergy subsidiary would have been required to rely on other capital resources to fund the remainder of the radiological decommissioning obligations unless the completion of decommissioning could be deferred during some number of years of safe storage status (as is permitted by NRC regulations). As of December 31, 2013, the total amount in the decommissioning trust for Indian Point 1 would not have been sufficient to initiate and complete the immediate near-term radiological decommissioning of that unit as measured by the NRC formula amount, but rather the funds would have been sufficient to continue holding the unit in a condition of safe storage status pending future completion of decommissioning; however, growth in the trust funds for Indian Point 2 and Palisades by December 31, 2013 had made them sufficient for initiation and completion of 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
immediate near-term radiological decommissioning as measured by the NRC formula amount. If any Entergy subsidiary decides to shut down one of its nuclear power plants earlier than the scheduled shutdown date and conduct decommissioning without the benefit of a safe storage period, the applicable Entergy subsidiary may be unable to rely upon only the decommissioning trust to fund the entire decommissioning obligations, which would require it to obtain funding from other sources. 
On August 27, 2013, Entergy announced its plan to close and decommission Vermont Yankee. Vermont Yankee is expected to cease power production in the fourth quarter 2014 at the end of its current fuel cycle. Assuming the end of Vermont Yankee operations in the fourth quarter 2014, the amount required to meet the NRC minimum for decommissioning financial assurance for license termination is $569.1 million . The Vermont Yankee decommissioning trust had a balance of approximately $612.1 million &#32;as of December 31, 2013, excluding the $40 million &#32;guarantee by Entergy Corporation to satisfy NRC requirements following the 2009 review of financial assurance levels. Filings with the NRC for planned shutdown activities will determine whether any other financial assurance may be required and will specifically address funding for spent fuel management, which will be required until the federal government takes possession of the fuel and removes it from the site, per its current obligation. 
Further, federal or state regulatory changes, including mandated increases in decommissioning funding or changes in the methods or standards for decommissioning operations, may also increase the funding requirements of, or accelerate the timing for funding of, the obligations related to the decommissioning of Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants. As a result, under any of these circumstances, Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially affected. 
Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are exposed to price risk. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries do not have a regulator-authorized rate of return on their capital investments in non-utility businesses. In particular, the sale of capacity and energy from the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, unless otherwise contracted, is subject to the fluctuation of market power prices. In order to reduce future price risk to desired levels, Entergy Wholesale Commodities utilizes contracts that are unit-contingent and Firm LD and various products such as forward sales, options, and collars. As of December 31, 2013, Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power generation plants had sold forward 74%, 74%, 40%, 29% and 17% of its generation portfolio&#8217;s planned energy output for 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. 
Market conditions such as product cost, market liquidity, and other portfolio considerations influence the product and contractual mix. The obligations under unit-contingent agreements depend on a generating asset that is operating; if the generation asset is not operating, the seller generally is not liable for damages. For some unit-contingent obligations, however, there is also a guarantee of availability that provides for the payment to the power purchaser of contract damages, if incurred, in the event the unit owner fails to deliver power as a result of the failure of the specified generation unit to generate power at or above a specified availability threshold. Firm LD sales transactions may be exposed to substantial operational price risk, a portion of which may be capped through the use of risk management products, to the extent that the plants do not run as expected and market prices exceed contract prices. 
Market prices may fluctuate substantially, sometimes over relatively short periods of time, and at other times experience sustained increases or decreases. Demand for electricity and its fuel stock can fluctuate dramatically, creating periods of substantial under- or over-supply. During periods of over-supply, prices might be depressed. Also, from time to time there may be political pressure, or pressure from regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over wholesale and retail energy commodity and transportation rates, to impose price limitations, credit requirements, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address volatility and other issues in these markets. 
The price that different counterparties offer for various products including forward sales is influenced both by market conditions as well as the contract terms such as damage provisions, credit support requirements, and the number of available counterparties interested in contracting for the desired forward period. Depending on differences between market factors at the time of contracting versus current conditions, Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217;s contract portfolio 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
may have average contract prices above or below current market prices, including at the expiration of the contracts, which may significantly affect Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. New hedges are generally layered into on a rolling forward basis, which tends to drive hedge over-performance to market in a falling price environment, and hedge underperformance to market in a rising price environment; however, hedge timing, product choice, and hedging costs will also affect these results. See the &#8220; Results of Operations &#32;- &#32; Realized Revenue per MWh for Entergy Wholesale Commodities Nuclear Plants &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries. With operating licenses for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 expiring in 2013 and 2015, respectively (see discussion above regarding the continued operation of Indian Point 2 and 3 past the license expiration dates), and as a consequence of any delays in obtaining extension of the operating licenses and any other approvals required for continued operation of the plants, Entergy Wholesale Commodities may enter into fewer unit-contingent forward sales contracts for output from such plants for periods beyond the license expiration. 
Among the factors that could affect market prices for electricity and fuel, all of which are beyond Entergy&#8217;s control to a significant degree, are: 
prevailing market prices for natural gas, uranium (and its conversion, enrichment, and fabrication), coal, oil, and other fuels used in electric generation plants, including associated transportation costs, and supplies of such commodities; 
seasonality and realized weather deviations compared to normalized weather forecasts; 
availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources and the requirements of a renewable portfolio standard; 
changes in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal and crude oil, and refined products; 
liquidity in the general wholesale electricity market, including the number of creditworthy counterparties available and interested in entering into forward sales agreements for Entergy&#8217;s full hedging term; 
the actions of external parties, such as the FERC and local independent system operators and other state or Federal energy regulatory bodies, that may impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in the energy markets; 
electricity transmission, competing generation or fuel transportation constraints, inoperability, or inefficiencies; 
the general demand for electricity, which may be significantly affected by national and regional economic conditions; 
weather conditions affecting demand for electricity or availability of hydroelectric power or fuel supplies; 
the rate of growth in demand for electricity as a result of population changes, regional economic conditions, and the implementation of conservation programs or distributed generation; 
regulatory policies of state agencies that affect the willingness of Entergy Wholesale Commodities customers to enter into long-term contracts generally, and contracts for energy in particular; 
increases in supplies due to actions of current Entergy Wholesale Commodities competitors or new market entrants, including the development of new generation facilities, expansion of existing generation facilities, the disaggregation of vertically integrated utilities, and improvements in transmission that allow additional supply to reach Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217;s nuclear markets; 
union and labor relations; 
changes in Federal and state energy and environmental laws and regulations and other initiatives, including but not limited to, the price impacts of proposed emission controls such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI); 
changes in law resulting from federal or state energy legislation or legislation subjecting energy derivatives used in hedging and risk management transactions to governmental regulation; and 
natural disasters, terrorist actions, wars, embargoes, and other catastrophic events. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative, regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 
The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulation. Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability. 
Public utilities under the Federal Power Act are required to obtain FERC acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity. Each of the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, as well as Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing, LLC, is a &#8220;public utility&#8221; under the Federal Power Act by virtue of making wholesale sales of electric energy. The FERC has granted these generating and power marketing companies the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. The FERC&#8217;s orders that grant the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217;s generating and power marketing companies market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if the FERC subsequently determines that the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217;s market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if any of its generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority and potential penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation. If the Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217;s generating or power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain the FERC&#8217;s acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have an adverse effect on the rates the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business charges for power from its facilities. 
The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules imposed by the existing Independent System Operators. The Independent System Operators that oversee most of the wholesale power markets impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps and other mechanisms, to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets. These types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on the profitability of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business&#8217; generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets. For further information regarding federal, state and local laws and regulation applicable to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see the &#8220; Regulation of Entergy&#8217;s Business &#8221; &#32;section in Part I, Item 1. 
The regulatory environment applicable to the electric power industry has undergone substantial changes over the past several years as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. These changes are ongoing and Entergy cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. In addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism and have raised claims that the competitive marketplace is not working because energy prices in wholesale markets exceed the marginal cost of operating nuclear power plants, as well as proposals to re-regulate the markets, impose a generation tax, or require divestitures by generating companies to reduce their market share. Other proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process, which could require material changes to business planning models. If competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, modified, discontinued, or delayed, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially affected. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
The power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to impairment charges in certain circumstances, which could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
Entergy reviews long-lived assets held in all of its business segments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of these assets is uncertain. Generally, the determination of recoverability is based on the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from the operations of such assets. Projected net cash flows depend on the future operating costs associated with the assets, the efficiency and availability of the assets and generating units, and the future market and price for energy and capacity over the remaining life of the assets. In particular, the assets of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to impairment if adverse market conditions arise and continue (such as expected long-term declines in market prices for electricity), if adverse regulatory events occur (including with respect to environmental regulation), if a unit ceases operation or if a unit&#8217;s operating license is not renewed. Moreover, the failure of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows, an unfavorable change in forecasted operating results or cash flows, or a decline in observable industry market multiples could all result in potential impairment charges for the affected assets. 
As discussed in the &#8220; Entergy Wholesale Commodities &#32;- Property&#8221; section in Part I, Item 1, the original expiration dates of the operating licenses for Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 are 2013 and 2015, respectively (see discussion above regarding the continued operation of Indian Point 2 and 3 past the license expiration dates),and are currently the subject of license renewal processes at the NRC and the state in which the plants operate. On August 27, 2013, Entergy announced its plan to close and decommission Vermont Yankee. Vermont Yankee is expected to cease power production in the fourth quarter 2014 at the end of its current fuel cycle. This decision was approved by the Board in August 2013, and resulted in the recognition of impairment charges in 2013. If Entergy concludes that any of its nuclear power plants is unlikely to operate through its current useful life, which conclusion would be based on a variety of factors, such a conclusion could result in an impairment of part or all of the carrying value of the plant. Any impairment charge taken by Entergy with respect to its long-lived assets, including the power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, would likely be material in the quarter that the charge is taken and could otherwise have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. 
General Business 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 
Entergy and the Utility operating companies depend on access to the capital markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could make it more difficult to handle future contingencies such as natural disasters or substantial increases in gas and fuel prices. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and the cost of capital. 
Entergy&#8217;s business is capital intensive and dependent upon its ability to access capital at reasonable rates and other terms. At times there are also spikes in the price for natural gas and other commodities that increase the liquidity requirements of the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. In addition, Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather-related or unforeseen disaster similar to that experienced in Entergy&#8217;s service territory with Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in 2005, Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike in 2008, and Hurricane Isaac in 2012. The occurrence of one or more contingencies, including a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel or purchased power costs or storm restoration costs, higher than expected pension contributions, an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines, less cash flow from operations than expected, or other unknown events, such as future storms, could cause the financing needs of Entergy and its subsidiaries to increase. In addition, accessing the debt capital markets more frequently in these situations may result in an increase in leverage. Material leverage increases could negatively affect the credit 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
ratings of Entergy and the Utility operating companies, which in turn could negatively affect access to the capital markets. 
The global capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in the fourth quarter of 2008 and much of 2009. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively affect Entergy and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to maintain and to expand their businesses. Events beyond Entergy&#8217;s control, such as the volatility and disruption in global capital and credit markets in 2008 and 2009, may create uncertainty that could increase its cost of capital or impair its ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on its bank credit facilities. Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their credit facilities as they come up for renewal. Moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. If Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could impact their ability to grow their businesses, decrease earnings, significantly reduce financial flexibility and/or limit Entergy Corporation&#8217;s ability to sustain its current common stock dividend level. 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) 
A downgrade in Entergy Corporation &#8217; s or its subsidiaries &#8217; credit ratings could negatively affect Entergy Corporation &#8217; s and its subsidiaries &#8217; ability to access capital and/or could require Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries to post collateral, accelerate certain payments, or repay certain indebtedness. 
There are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for each of Entergy Corporation and the Registrant Subsidiaries, including each Registrant&#8217;s regulatory framework, ability to recover costs and earn returns, diversification and financial strength and liquidity. If one or more rating agencies downgrade Entergy Corporation&#8217;s, any of the Utility operating companies&#8217;, or System Energy&#8217;s ratings, particularly below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and cash or letter of credit collateral demands may be triggered by the terms of a number of commodity contracts, leases, and other agreements. 
Most of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; large customers, suppliers, and counterparties require sufficient creditworthiness to enter into transactions. If Entergy Corporation&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; ratings decline, particularly below investment grade, or if certain counterparties believe Entergy Corporation or the Utility operating companies are losing creditworthiness and demand adequate assurance under fuel, gas, and purchased power contracts, the counterparties may require posting of collateral in cash or letters of credit, prepayment for fuel, gas or purchased power or accelerated payment, or counterparties may decline business with Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2013, based on power prices at that time, Entergy had liquidity exposure of $274 million under the guarantees in place supporting Entergy Wholesale Commodities transactions and $104 million of posted cash collateral. As of December 31, 2013, the liquidity exposure associated with Entergy Wholesale Commodities assurance requirements, including return of previously posted collateral from counterparties, would increase by $123 million for a $1 per MMBtu increase in gas prices in both the short- and long-term markets. In the event of a decrease in Entergy Corporation&#8217;s credit rating to below investment grade, based on power prices as of December 31, 2013, Entergy would have been required to provide approximately $113 million of additional cash or letters of credit under some of the agreements.

The construction of, and capital improvements to, power generation facilities involve substantial risks. Should construction or capital improvement efforts be unsuccessful, the financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies could be materially affected. 
Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; ability to complete construction of power generation facilities in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. These variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise and escalating costs for materials, labor, and environmental compliance. Delays in obtaining permits, shortages in materials and qualified labor, suppliers and contractors not performing as required under their contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, poor quality initial cost estimates from contractors, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, changes in commodity prices affecting revenue, fuel costs, or materials costs, downward changes in the economy, changes in law or regulation, including environmental compliance requirements, and other events beyond the control of the Utility operating companies or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost, and performance of these projects. If these projects are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, Entergy and the Utility operating companies could incur additional costs and termination payments, or face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project. For further information regarding capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital in connection with the potential construction of additional generation supply sources within the Utility operating companies&#8217; service territory, and as to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see the &#8220; Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of the Registrant Subsidiaries. 
The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to environmental and other matters. 
The businesses in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation by local, state, and Federal authorities. These laws and regulations affect the manner in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business conduct their operations and make capital expenditures. These laws and regulations also affect how the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business manage air emissions, discharges to water, wetlands impacts, solid and hazardous waste storage and disposal, cooling and service water intake, the protection of threatened and endangered species, hazardous materials transportation, and similar matters. Federal, state, and local authorities continually revise these laws and regulations, and the laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and to the permitting and enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. Developing and implementing plans for facility compliance with these requirements can lead to capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures. Violations of these requirements can subject the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties&#8217; claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. In addition, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to liability under these laws for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned or operated by the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. The Utility operating companies are currently involved in proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been released and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance. 
Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury, particulates, greenhouse gases, and other regulated air emissions from generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulation, controls and mitigation expenses. In addition, existing air regulations and programs promulgated by the EPA often are challenged legally, sometimes resulting in large-scale changes to anticipated regulatory regimes and the resulting need to shift course, both operationally and 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
economically, depending on the nature of the changes. Risks relating to global climate change, initiatives to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions, and water availability issues are discussed below. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if Entergy and its subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain, or comply with any such approval, the operation of its facilities could be stopped or become subject to additional costs. For further information regarding environmental regulation and environmental matters, see the &#8220; Regulation of Entergy &#8217; s Business &#32; &#8211; Environmental Regulation &#8221; section of Part I, Item 1. 
The Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs related to reliability standards. 
Entergy&#8217;s business is subject to extensive and mandatory reliability standards. Such standards, which are established by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), the SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC), and other regional enforcement entities, are approved by the FERC and frequently are reviewed, amended, and supplemented. Failure to comply with such standards could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of such standards. The standards, as well as the laws and regulations that govern them, are subject to judicial interpretation and to the enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. In addition to exposure to civil penalties and fines, the Utility operating companies have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to compliance with new and existing reliability standards, including costs associated with the Utility operating companies&#8217; transmission system and generation assets. The changes to the reliability standards applicable to the electric power industry are ongoing, and Entergy cannot predict the ultimate effect that the reliability standards will have on its Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. 
(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 
The effects of weather and economic conditions, and the related impact on electricity and gas usage, may materially affect the Utility operating companies &#8217; results of operations. 
Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenues, and temperatures below moderate levels in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenues. As a corollary, moderate temperatures tend to decrease usage of energy and resulting revenues. Seasonal pricing differentials, coupled with higher consumption levels, typically cause the Utility operating companies to report higher revenues in the third quarter of the fiscal year than in the other quarters. Extreme weather conditions or storms, however, may stress the Utility operating companies&#8217; generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on their ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. These extreme conditions could have a material effect on the Utility operating companies&#8217; financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
Entergy&#8217;s electricity sales volumes are affected by a number of factors, including the state of the national and regional economies, weather, customer bill sizes (large bills tend to induce conservation), trends in energy efficiency, and the willingness and ability of large industrial customers to develop co-generation facilities that greatly reduce their demand from Entergy. Some of these factors are inherently cyclical or temporary in nature, such as the weather or economic conditions, and rarely have a long-lasting impact on Entergy's operating results. Others, such as the increasing adoption of energy efficient appliances and building codes, are having a more permanent impact of reducing sales growth rates from historical norms. Newer technologies such as distributed generation have not yet had a substantive impact on Entergy&#8217;s electricity sales, but further advances have the potential to do so in the future. Since the national economy emerged from the last recession in 2009, Entergy&#8217;s industrial sales in particular have benefited from steady economic growth and relatively low natural gas prices from an historical perspective. Any substantial negative change in any of these factors has the potential to result in slower or declining sales growth and increased bad debt expense, 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
The effects of climate change and environmental and regulatory obligations intended to compel greenhouse gas emission reductions or to place a price on greenhouse gas emissions could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy, the Utility operating companies, and System Energy. 
In an effort to address climate change concerns, Federal, state, and local authorities are calling for additional laws and regulations aimed at known or suspected causes of climate change. For example, in response to the United States Supreme Court&#8217;s 2007 decision holding that the EPA has authority to regulate emissions of CO2 and other &#8220;greenhouse gases&#8221; under the Clean Air Act, the EPA, various environmental interest groups, and other organizations are focusing considerable attention on CO2 emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. In 2010, EPA promulgated its first regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from certain vehicles and from new and significantly modified stationary sources of emissions, including electric generating units. In 2012 and 2013, EPA proposed a CO2 emission standard for new sources; this standard is expected to be finalized in 2014. Additionally, EPA is expected to propose a CO2 emission standard for existing power generation facilities in 2014 for finalization in 2015. As examples of state action, in the Northeast, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) establishes a cap on CO2 emissions from electric power plants and requires generators to purchase emission permits to cover their CO2 emissions, and a similar program has been developed in California. 
Developing and implementing plans for compliance with greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing facilities and proposed projects; moreover, long-term planning to meet environmental requirements can be negatively impacted and costs may increase to the extent laws and regulations change prior to full implementation. Violations of such requirements may subject Entergy Wholesale Commodities and the Utility operating companies to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties&#8217; claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. To the extent Entergy believes any of these costs are recoverable in rates, however, additional material rate increases for customers could be resisted by Entergy&#8217;s regulators and, in extreme cases, Entergy&#8217;s regulators might deny or defer timely recovery of these costs. Future changes in environmental regulation governing the emission of CO2 and other greenhouse gases could make some of Entergy&#8217;s electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the difficulty that Entergy and its subsidiaries have with obtaining or maintaining required environmental regulatory approvals, which could also materially affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of Entergy and its subsidiaries. In addition, lawsuits currently are pending or are reasonably expected against emitters of greenhouse gases alleging that these companies are liable for personal injuries and property damage caused by climate change. These lawsuits may seek injunctive relief, monetary compensation, and punitive damages. 
In addition to the regulatory and financial risks associated with climate change discussed above, physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level, wind and storm surge damages, wetland and barrier island erosion, risks of flooding and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation, average temperatures, and potential increased impacts of extreme weather conditions or storms. Entergy subsidiaries own assets in, and serve, communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, storms, and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands. A significant portion of the nation&#8217;s oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by wetland and barrier island erosion, which could give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes. Entergy and its subsidiaries also face the risk that climate change could impact the availability and quality of water supply necessary for operations. 
These and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on the Entergy System&#8217;s ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. Also, to the extent that climate 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
change adversely impacts the economic health of a region or results in energy conservation or demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and revenues. Such physical or operational risks could have a material effect on Entergy&#8217;s, Entergy Wholesale Commodities, System Energy, and the Utility operating companies&#8217; financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. 
Continued and future availability and quality of water for cooling, process, and sanitary uses could materially affect the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. 
Water is a vital natural resource that also is critical to the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities&#8217;s business operations. Entergy&#8217;s facilities use water for cooling, boiler make-up, sanitary uses, potable supply, and many other uses. Two of Entergy&#8217;s Utility operating companies own and/or operate hydroelectric facilities. Accordingly, water availability and quality are critical to Entergy&#8217;s business operations. Impacts to water availability or quality could negatively impact both operations and revenues. 
Entergy secures water through various mechanisms (ground water wells, surface waters intakes, municipal supply, etc.) and operates under the provisions and conditions set forth by the provider and/or regulatory authorities. Entergy also obtains and operates in substantial compliance with water discharge permits issued under various provisions of the Clean Water Act. Regulations and authorizations for both water intake and use and for waste discharge can become more stringent in times of water shortages, low flows in rivers, low lake levels, low groundwater aquifer volumes, and similar conditions. The increased use of water by industry, agriculture, and the population at large, population growth, and the potential impacts of climate change on water resources may cause water use restrictions that affect Entergy and its subsidiaries. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity prices, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. 
To manage near-term financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, Entergy and its subsidiaries, including the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, may enter into contracts to hedge portions of their purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements, and inventories of natural gas, uranium (and its conversion), coal, refined products, and other commodities, within established risk management guidelines. As part of this strategy, Entergy and its subsidiaries may utilize fixed- and variable-price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. However, Entergy and its subsidiaries normally cover only a portion of the exposure of their assets and positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. In addition, Entergy also elects to leave certain volumes during certain years unhedged. To the extent Entergy and its subsidiaries have unhedged positions, fluctuating commodity prices can materially affect Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; results of operations and financial position. 
Although Entergy and its subsidiaries devote a considerable effort to these risk management strategies, they cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these activities. As a result of these and other factors, Entergy and its subsidiaries cannot predict with precision the impact that risk management decisions may have on their business, results of operations, or financial position. 
Entergy has guaranteed or indemnified the performance of a portion of the obligations relating to hedging and risk management activities. Reductions in Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; credit quality or changes in the market prices of energy commodities could increase the cash or letter of credit collateral required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management activities, which could materially affect Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; liquidity and financial position. 
Part I Item 1A &#38; 1B 
Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 
The Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations, which may materially affect the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 
The hedging and risk management practices of the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe Entergy and its subsidiaries money, energy, or other commodities will not perform their obligations. Currently, some hedging agreements contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure all or part of their obligations to Entergy or its subsidiaries. If the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, Entergy or its subsidiaries may enforce and recover the proceeds from the credit support provided and acquire alternative hedging arrangements or draw on the credit support provided by the counterparties, which credit support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. In such event, Entergy and its subsidiaries might incur losses in addition to amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. In addition, the credit commitments of Entergy&#8217;s lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such lenders, which could materially affect the adequacy of its liquidity sources. 
The Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010 and rules and regulations promulgated under the act may adversely affect the ability of the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to utilize certain commodity derivatives for hedging and mitigating commercial risk. 
The Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, which was enacted on July 21, 2010 as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated under the act impose governmental regulation on the over-the-counter derivative market, including the commodity swaps used by the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to hedge and mitigate commercial risk. Under the act, certain swaps are subject to mandatory clearing and exchange trading requirements. Swap dealers and major market participants in the swap market are subject to capital, margin, registration, reporting, recordkeeping, and business conduct requirements with respect to their swap activities. Entergy is not a swap dealer or a major swap participant, and does not expect to qualify as either in the future. Non-swap dealers and non-major swap participants, such as Entergy, are subject to reporting, recordkeeping, and business conduct requirements (i.e., anti-manipulation, anti-disruptive trading practices, and whistleblower provisions) with respect to their swap activities. Position limits may also apply to certain swaps activities. Position limit rules promulgated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission were vacated by the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has subsequently proposed new position limit rules. If the Commodity Futures Trading Commission&#8217;s issues final position limit rules, those rules may apply to certain of Entergy&#8217;s swaps activities. 
The act required the applicable regulators, which in the case of commodity swaps will be the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to engage in substantial rulemaking in order to implement the provisions of the act and such rulemaking has been largely completed. Both the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business currently utilize commodity swaps to hedge and mitigate commodity price risk. It is not known whether the act and regulations promulgated under the act will have an adverse effect upon the market for the commodity swaps used by the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. However, to the extent that the act and regulations promulgated under the act have the effect of increasing the price of such commodity swaps or limiting or reducing the availability of such commodity swaps, whether through the imposition of additional capital, margin, or compliance costs upon market participants, the imposition of position limits, or otherwise, the financial performance of the Utility operating companies and/or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may be adversely affected. To the extent that the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may be required to post margin in connection with existing or future commodity swaps in addition to any margin currently posted by such entities, such entities may need to secure additional sources of capital to meet such liquidity needs or cease utilizing such commodity swaps.

Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require additional funding. 
The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under Entergy&#8217;s pension and postretirement benefit plans. A decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements relating to Entergy&#8217;s benefit plan liabilities. Volatility in the capital markets has affected the market value of these assets, which may affect Entergy&#8217;s planned levels of contributions in the future. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Entergy&#8217;s pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. The funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans can also increase as a result of changes in, among other factors, retirement rates, life expectancy assumptions, or Federal regulations. For further information regarding Entergy&#8217;s pension and other postretirement benefit plans, refer to the &#8220; Critical Accounting Estimates &#32; &#8211; Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits &#8221; section of Management&#8217;s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of its Registrant Subsidiaries and Note 11 to the financial statements. 
The litigation environment in the states in which certain Entergy subsidiaries operate poses a significant risk to those businesses. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, asbestos, hazardous material and ratepayer matters, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters. The states in which the Utility operating companies operate, in particular Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, have proven to be unusually litigious environments. Judges and juries in these states have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort cases. Entergy and its subsidiaries use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against them, but the litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk. 
Terrorist attacks, including cyber attacks, and failures or breaches of Entergy&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; technology systems may adversely affect Entergy&#8217;s results of operations. 
As power generators and distributors, Entergy and its subsidiaries face heightened risk of an act or threat of terrorism, including physical and cyber attacks, either as a direct act against one of Entergy&#8217;s generation facilities, an act against the transmission and distribution infrastructure used to transport power that affects its ability to operate, or an act against the information technology systems and network infrastructure of Entergy and its subsidiaries. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite the implementation of security measures by Entergy and its subsidiaries, all technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures, or unauthorized access due to such activities. If Entergy&#8217;s or its subsidiaries&#8217; technology systems were to fail or be breached and be unable to recover in a timely way, Entergy or its subsidiaries may be unable to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and other data could be compromised. 
If any such attacks, failures or breaches were to occur, Entergy&#8217;s and the Utility operating companies&#8217; business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially affected. The risk of such attacks, failures, or breaches also may cause Entergy and the Utility operating companies to incur increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for its nuclear power plants and other facilities, such as additional physical facility security and additional security personnel, and for systems to protect its information technology and network infrastructure systems.

Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact Entergy&#8217;s, the Utility operating companies&#8217;, and System Energy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 
Entergy and its subsidiaries make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use, and employment-related taxes. These judgments include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. Entergy and its subsidiaries also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. Changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by Entergy and its subsidiaries could negatively affect Entergy&#8217;s, the Utility operating companies&#8217;, and System Energy&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. For further information regarding Entergy&#8217;s accounting for tax obligations, refer to Note 3 to the financial statements. 
(Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans) 
The effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers may adversely affect Entergy Gulf States Louisiana&#8217;s and Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s results of operations and liquidity. 
Gas rates charged to retail gas customers are comprised primarily of purchased gas cost charges, which provide no return or profit to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans, and distribution charges, which provide a return or profit to the utility. Distribution charges are affected by the amount of gas sold to customers. Purchased gas cost charges, which comprise most of a customer&#8217;s bill and may be adjusted monthly, represent gas commodity costs that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans recovers from its customers. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana&#8217;s or Entergy New Orleans&#8217;s cash flows can be affected by differences between the time period when gas is purchased and the time when ultimate recovery from customers occurs. When purchased gas cost charges increase substantially reflecting higher gas procurement costs incurred by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans, customer usage may decrease, especially in weaker economic times, resulting in lower distribution charges for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans which could adversely affect results of operations. 
(System Energy) 
System Energy owns and operates a single nuclear generating facility, and it is dependent on affiliated companies for all of its revenues. 
System Energy&#8217;s operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% ownership/leasehold interest in Grand Gulf. Charges under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are paid by the Utility operating companies as consideration for their respective entitlements to receive capacity and energy. The useful economic life of Grand Gulf is finite and is limited by the terms of its operating license, which is currently due to expire on November 1, 2024. System Energy filed in October 2011 an application with the NRC for an extension of Grand Gulf&#8217;s operating license to 2044. System Energy&#8217;s financial condition depends both on the receipt of payments from the Utility operating companies under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and on the continued commercial operation of Grand Gulf. 
For information regarding the Unit Power Sales Agreement, the sale and leaseback transactions and certain other agreements relating to the Entergy System companies&#8217; support of System Energy (including the Capital Funds Agreement), see the &#8220; Grand Gulf-Related Agreements &#8221; section of Note 8 to the financial statements and the &#8220; Sale and Leaseback Transactions &#8221; section of Note 10 to the financial statements, and the &#8220; Utility &#32;- System Energy and Related Agreements &#8221; section of Part I, Item 1.

(Entergy Corporation) 
As a holding company, Entergy Corporation depends on cash distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service and other financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock. 
Entergy Corporation is a holding company with no material revenue generating operations of its own or material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, all of its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. Entergy Corporation&#8217;s ability to satisfy its financial obligations, including the payment of interest and principal on its outstanding debt, and to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the payment to it of dividends or distributions by its subsidiaries. The payments of dividends or distributions to Entergy Corporation by its subsidiaries in turn depend on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings, and on any applicable legal, regulatory, or contractual limitations on subsidiaries&#8217; ability to pay such dividends or distributions. Provisions in the organizational documents, indentures for debt issuances, and other agreements of certain of Entergy Corporation&#8217;s subsidiaries restrict the payment of cash dividends to Entergy Corporation. For further information regarding dividend or distribution restrictions to Entergy Corporation, see the &#8220; Retained Earnings and Dividend Restrictions &#8221; section of Note 7 to the financial statements.
