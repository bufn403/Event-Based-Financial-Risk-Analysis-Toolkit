Many titles are also published in Spanish.  We also own the line of books originallypublished by Kane/Miller Book Publishers, having purchased them in December 2008.  The majority of the titles in this lineoriginally were published in other countries in their native languages. We have a broad line of internet-linkedbooks which allow readers to expand their educational experience by referringthem to relevant non-Usborne websites. Our books include science and math titles, as well as chapter books andnovels. We also produce anddistribute Usborne Kid Kits, which combine an Usborne book with specialtyitems/toys that complement the information contained in the book. We continually introduce newtitles across all lines of our products. UBAM markets the books through commissionedconsultants using a combination of direct sales, home parties, book fairs andthe Internet.  The division hadapproximately 8,400 consultants in 50 states at February 28, 2009. Publishing markets through commissioned traderepresentatives who call on book, toy, specialty stores and other retailoutlets, as well as through in-house marketing by telephone to the trade.  This division markets to approximately 5,000book, toy and specialty stores. Significant orders totaling 34% of the Publishing Divisions sales havebeen received from major book chains. During fiscal year 2009, the division continued to expand into massmerchandising outlets such as drug, department and discount stores. SeasonalitySales for both divisions are greatest duringthe Fall due to the holiday season. CompetitionWe face competition on twofronts for our UBAM Division from several other larger direct selling companies- - for sales and consultants.  However, noother direct selling company exclusively sells childrens books.  Our school and library market faces strongcompetition from Scholastic Books for the book fair market. Publishing faces strong competition fromlarge U.S. and international companies. Historically, this divisions sales are approximately 1.0% of industrysales of juvenile paperbacks. EmployeesAs of April 1, 2009, 76 full-time and 2part-time employees worked at our Tulsa and LaJolla facilities; about half ofthose are in the assembly/distribution warehouse.  We believe our relations with our employees aregood. Company ReportsOur annual and quarterly reports (Forms 10-K and 10-Q), current Form 8-K reports and amendments to those reports filed with the SEC are available for download from the Investor Relations portion of our Internet website at www.edcpub.com. 4Table of Contents Item1A.  RISK FACTORS Notrequired by smaller reporting company. "
