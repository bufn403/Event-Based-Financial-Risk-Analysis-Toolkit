.Described below and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” are certain risks that the company’s management believes are applicable to the company’s business and the industries in which it operates. If any one or more of the described events occur, the company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, stock price, liquidity, or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected. When stated below that a risk may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business, it means that such risk may have one or more of these effects. There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known.Business RisksIf the company is unable to maintain its relationships with its suppliers, if the suppliers materially change the terms of their existing agreements with the company or the company fails to abide by the terms of such agreements, if suppliers cease selling their products through distribution generally, or if supply chain shortages and other disruptions occur, the company’s business could be materially adversely affected.A substantial portion of the company’s inventory is purchased from suppliers with which the company has entered into non-exclusive distribution agreements. These agreements are typically cancellable at any time or on short notice (generally 30 to 90 days). Some of the company’s businesses rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide a high percentage of their revenues. For example, sales of products from one of the company’s suppliers accounted for approximately 10% of the company’s consolidated sales in 2023. To the extent that the company’s significant suppliers reduce the number of products they sell through distribution or cease selling their products through distribution entirely, experience disruptions in their supply chains, cease to continue doing business with the company, or are unable to continue to meet or significantly alter their obligations, the company’s business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, to the extent the company’s suppliers modify the terms of their contracts to the detriment of the company, limit supplies due to capacity constraints or other factors, or cancel such contracts or exercise remedies thereunder due to the company’s breach of contract terms, there could be a material adverse effect on the company’s business. Further, the supplier landscape has continued to experience a consolidation, which could negatively impact the company if the surviving, consolidated suppliers decide to exclude the company from their supply chains, and which could expose the company to increased pricing and dependence on a smaller number of suppliers, among other risks. Increasing consolidation in the industries where the company’s suppliers operate may occur as companies combine to achieve further economies of scale and other synergies, which could result in reduced supplies, as companies seek to eliminate duplicative product lines, and increased prices, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business.The company’s revenues originate primarily from the sales of semiconductor, IP&E (Interconnect, Passive & Electromechanical), and IT hardware and software products, the sales of which are traditionally cyclical and may be impacted by shortages and other disruptions in the global supply chain.  ​The semiconductor industry historically has experienced fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity and significant economic market upturns and downturns. Sales of semiconductor products and related services represented approximately 60%, 60%, and 57%, of the company’s consolidated sales in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The sale of the company’s IP&E products closely tracks the semiconductor market. Accordingly, the company’s revenues and profitability, particularly in its global components reportable segment, may be adversely affected by weakness in the semiconductor market, which the company has experienced during 2023. Further, economic weakness could cause a decline in spending in information technology, which could reduce demand for semiconductors and other products and related services and thereby have a negative impact on the company’s ECS business. A prolongation or worsening of the current weakness in semiconductor markets, or a future cyclical downturn in the technology industry, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and negatively impact its ability to maintain historical profitability levels.9Table of ContentsThe competitive pressures the company faces, such as pricing and margin reductions, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business.The company operates in a highly competitive international environment. The company competes with other large multinational and national electronic components and enterprise computing solutions distributors, as well as numerous other smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on narrower market sectors, products, or industries. The company also competes for customers with its suppliers. The size of the company’s competitors varies across market sectors, as do the resources the company has allocated to the sectors in which it does business. Therefore, some of the company’s competitors may have a more extensive customer and/or supplier base than the company in one or more of its market sectors. There is also significant competition within each market sector and geography that creates pricing and margin pressure and continuous demand for the company to improve service and product offerings. Other competitive factors include rapid technological changes, product availability, credit availability, speed of delivery, ability to tailor solutions to changing customer needs, quality and depth of product lines and training, and increasing demand for customer service and support. The company also faces competition from companies in the logistics and product fulfillment, catalog distribution, e-commerce, and supply chain services markets. As the company continues to expand its business into new areas in order to stay competitive in the market, the company may encounter increased competition from its current and/or new competitors, making it difficult to retain or increase its market share. Further, the enterprise computing solutions industry has recently experienced, and continues to experience increased consolidation, resulting in companies with greater scale, market presence, and purchasing power. As a result, competition among enterprise computing distributors has increased. Declines in value of the company’s inventory could materially adversely affect its business.The market for the company’s products and services is subject to rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, changes in end-market demand, evolving customer expectations and demands, oversupply of product, and regulatory requirements, which can contribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of inventory. Although many of the company’s suppliers provide the company with certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and certain rights of return), the company cannot be sure that such protections will fully compensate it for the loss in value, that the suppliers will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements, or that the company will be able to continue to secure such protections in the future. For example, many of the company’s suppliers will not allow products to be returned after they have been held in inventory beyond a certain amount of time, and, in most instances, the return rights are limited to a certain percentage of the amount of products the company purchased in a particular time frame. Therefore, the company is not fully protected from a decline in the value of the company’s inventory, and such decline could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business.​The company’s lack of long-term sales contracts may have a material adverse effect on its business.Most of the company’s sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts. The company generally works with its customers to develop non-binding forecasts for future orders. Based on such non-binding forecasts, the company makes commitments regarding the level of business that it will seek and accept, the inventory that it purchases, and the levels of utilization of personnel and other resources. A variety of conditions over which the company has little or no control, both specific to each customer or generally affecting each customer’s industry or the broader market may cause customers to cancel, reduce, or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated, file for bankruptcy protection, or default on their payments owed to the company. Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays in orders by customers, loss of customers, changes in pricing and sourcing, and/or customer defaults on payments could materially adversely affect the company’s business.​The company’s non-U.S. sales represent a significant portion of its revenues, and consequently, the company is exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.In 2023, 2022, and 2021, approximately 66%, 65%, and 66%, respectively, of the company’s sales came from its operations outside the United States. As a result of the significant extent of the company’s international sales and number of foreign locations, its operations are subject to a variety of risks inherent in international operations, including the following: ​10Table of Contents•import and export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;•the burden and cost of compliance with international laws, regulations, treaties, and technical standards, including, without limitation, with respect to tax; •potential restrictions on transfers of funds;•trade protection measures, import and export tariffs and other restrictions, duties, and value-added taxes;•transportation delays and interruptions;•uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations; •foreign laws that potentially discriminate against or disfavor companies headquartered outside the relevant jurisdiction;•stringent antitrust regulations in local jurisdictions;•volatility associated with sovereign debt of certain international economies; •various jurisdictions’ environmental protection laws and regulations, including those related to climate change; •potential social unrest, military conflicts, government shutdowns and disruptions, and other geopolitical risks and uncertainties; and•currency fluctuations.​Refer to “Foreign Currency Exchange Risk” in Item 7.A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for a further discussion of the company’s description of the impacts of foreign currency exchange rates on the company’s results and projections.​Further, the impact of lower gross margins in certain regions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business. For example, the company’s gross margins in the components business in the Asia/Pacific region tend to be lower than those in other markets in which the company sells products and services. If sales in this market increase as a percentage of overall sales, consolidated gross margins will be lower.​Changes in the company’s global mix of earnings, and changes in tax law and policy, could cause fluctuations in the company’s effective tax rate, and could materially adversely impact results.The company’s effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by, among other things, changes in the geographic mix of earnings that are subject to income taxes both in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Tax regulations governing each jurisdiction impact statutory tax rates, deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, and ultimately income taxes payable. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the company’s determination of the value of its deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions.​The estimated effects of applicable tax laws, including current interpretation of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, have been incorporated into the company’s financial results. However, the U.S. Department of Treasury, Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), and other standard-setting bodies could issue future legislation or guidance that might negatively impact the company’s tax planning or differ from the company’s interpretations. ​In 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) announced the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, which provides for a two-pillar solution to address tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy.  Pillar one expands a country’s authority to tax profits from companies that make sales into their country but do not have a physical location in the country.  Pillar two includes an agreement on international tax reform, including rules to ensure that large corporations pay a minimum rate of corporate income tax. In December of 2021, the OECD released pillar two model rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large corporations at a minimum rate of 15%. The OECD continues to release additional guidance on the two-pillar framework, with widespread implementation, in many countries in which the company operates, beginning in 2024. The company is continuing to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of the two-pillar framework, pending legislative adoption by individual countries. Any new legislation could impact the company’s tax obligations in countries where it does business and result in increased taxation of our international earnings, but should not have an adverse impact on its business.​Changes to U.S. or foreign tax laws could have broader implications, including impacts to the economy, currency markets, inflation, or competitive dynamics, which are difficult to predict, and may negatively impact the company. Such tax 11Table of Contentsdevelopments could further increase uncertainty and have a material adverse impact on the company’s cash flows, effective tax rate and financial results.​Additionally, the company’s tax returns are subject to periodic audits by U.S. and foreign tax authorities. These audits may result in global reallocation of income and expense that is different from what has been estimated in the company's financial results. Such tax audits could result in an adverse effect on the company’s tax liability, increase effective tax rates, and increase the complexity and cost of tax compliance, all of which could adversely impact the company’s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.​When the company makes acquisitions, it may take on additional liabilities or may not be able to successfully integrate such acquisitions.As part of the company’s history and growth strategy, it has acquired other businesses, and continues to evaluate strategic opportunities to acquire additional businesses from time to time. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:​•effectively combining the acquired operations, technologies, or products;•unanticipated costs or assumed liabilities, including, but not limited to, those associated with combining and integrating operations, technologies, and facilities;•costs associated with regulatory actions or investigations;•the inability to retain and obtain required regulatory approvals, licenses, and permits:•not realizing the anticipated financial benefit from the acquired companies;•in the event the acquisition is funded with proceeds of indebtedness, increased interest costs;•diversion of management’s attention;•negative effects on existing customer and supplier relationships; •disruption due to the integration and rationalization of operations, products, technologies, and personnel; and•potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies.​The company has in the past, and may in the future, divest or reduce its investment in certain businesses or product lines from time to time. Such divestitures involve risks, such as difficulty separating portions from the company’s other businesses, distracting employees, incurring potential loss of revenue, negatively impacting margins, and potentially disrupting customer relationships. The company may also incur significant costs associated with exit or disposal activities, related impairment charges, or both.​Further, the company has made, and may continue to make acquisitions of, or investments in new services or technologies to expand its current service offerings and product lines. Some of these may involve risks that may differ from those traditionally associated with the company’s core distribution business. In addition, the company's effective tax rate for future periods could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions. If the company is not able to successfully manage any of these risks in relation to future acquisitions or divestitures, it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business.​If the company is not able to or fails to adequately invest successfully in and introduce digital and other technological developments, or its suppliers are not able to continue to offer competitive components and electronic computing solutions, it could materially adversely impact results.The company’s industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes, and the company’s ability to meet its customers’ needs and expectations is key to the company’s ability to grow sales and earnings. The company’s customers and suppliers increasingly expect the company’s platforms to include digital technologies to facilitate distribution of components and electronic computing solutions over time. For example, the ability of customers to access their accounts, place orders, and otherwise interface with the company using digital technology is an important aspect of the distribution industry, and distribution companies are rapidly introducing new digital and other technology-driven products and services that aim to offer a better customer experience and reduce costs. If the company is unable to maintain and enhance its digital platforms to keep pace with competitors and align with evolving customer and supplier expectations and demands, it could adversely impact the company’s sales revenues and ability to retain existing, and attract new, customers.12Table of Contents​The company’s sales are also partially dependent on continued innovations in components and electronic computing solutions by its suppliers, the competitiveness of its suppliers’ offerings, and the company’s ability to partner with new and emerging technology providers. See also “The competitive pressures the company faces, such as pricing and margin reductions, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business”. ​Operational RisksThe company’s success depends upon its ability to attract, retain, motivate, and develop key executive and employee talent and the strategies they develop and implement.Any failure to attract, retain, motivate, and develop key executive and employee talent may materially and adversely affect the company’s business. The company’s success depends, to a significant extent, on the capability, expertise, and continued services of its key executives. The company relies on the expertise and experience of certain key executives in developing business strategies, managing business operations, and cultivating new and maintaining existing relationships with customers and suppliers. If the company were to lose any of its key executives, it may not be able to find a suitable replacement with comparable knowledge and experience in a timely manner, or if at all, at a similar level of remuneration and other benefits. Restrictions on immigration or changes in immigration laws could limit the company’s access to qualified and skilled professionals, increase the cost of doing business, or otherwise disrupt operations.​Additionally, management transitions, such as the company's transition to a new president of the global components business in 2023, may create uncertainty, divert resources and management attention, or impact public or market perception, any of which could negatively impact the company's ability to operate effectively or execute its strategies and result in an adverse impact on its business. Further, new executives may have different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives from those individuals who previously served in these roles and thus may have different views on the issues that will determine the company’s future, potentially resulting in employee, customer, and supplier uncertainty.​The company relies heavily on its internal information systems, which, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect the company’s business.The company’s current global operations reside on multiple technology platforms. The size and complexity of the company’s computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, and ransom attack. Failure to properly or adequately address any unaccounted for or unforeseen issues could impact the company’s ability to perform necessary business operations, which could materially adversely affect the company’s business.Cybersecurity and Privacy RiskCybersecurity incidents as well as ransomware may hurt the company’s business, damage its reputation, increase its costs, and cause losses.The company’s information technology systems could be subject to significant cyber security and privacy incidents, including, but not limited to, invasion, inducement (fraudulent or otherwise) by third parties to obtain information from employees, customers, or suppliers; cyber-attacks; ransom demands; or cybersecurity breaches caused by third parties as well as employees and others with authorized access. ​Any such incident, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in, without limitation, disruption to the company’s operations; loss or compromise of, or damage to, the company’s or any of its customers’ or suppliers’ data, confidential information; significant legal, regulatory, and financial exposure; damage to the company’s reputation; significant costs related to rebuilding internal systems, managing company brand and reputation, litigation, damages, responding to regulatory inquiries, and taking other remedial steps; loss of competitive advantage; and a loss of confidence in the security of the company’s information technology systems. In each case, that could potentially have an adverse impact on the company’s business, including by impairing the company’s ability to sell its products and services. Because the techniques used to cause these incidents and gain unauthorized access to, disable, or sabotage the company’s information technology systems and data stored on those systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched, the company may 13Table of Contentsbe unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive or protective measures to guard against them. Further, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, are a source of risk because they could be subject to the same or other similar types of incidents, for example in the event of a failure of their own systems and infrastructure or if they experience their own privacy or security event, which could create risks similar to those described above. These third parties could include organizations in the company’s supply chain, which if subject to an incident, could adversely impact the company’s ability to deliver its goods and services. ​Failure to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain privacy and data protections laws and regulations may subject us to substantial negative financial consequences and civil or criminal penalties.​Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity are also rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. The company’s actual or perceived failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.​Regulatory and Legal RisksProducts sold by the company may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against the company, which may have a material adverse effect on the company.The company sells its components at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. As a result, the company may face claims for damages (such as consequential damages) that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits it receives from the components involved in the claims. Further, the company’s ability to avoid such liabilities pursuant to defective product provisions in its supplier agreements may be limited as a result of differing factors, such as the inability to exclude such damages due to the laws of some of the countries where the company does business. The company’s business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in the products sold by the company, if it is required to pay for the associated damages. The company’s product liability insurance is limited in coverage and amount and may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims. Further, when relying on contractual liability exclusions, the company could lose customers if their claims are not addressed to their satisfaction.The company is subject to U.S. and certain foreign export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti-corruption laws, anti-bribery laws, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. In the event of non-compliance, the company can face serious consequences, which can harm its business.The company is subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), U.S. Customs regulations, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls (“OFAC”). Products the company sells which are either manufactured in the United States or based on U.S. technology (“U.S. Products”) are subject to the EAR when exported and re-exported to and from all international jurisdictions, in addition to the local jurisdiction’s export regulations applicable to individual shipments. Licenses or proper license exemptions may be required by local jurisdictions’ export regulations, including EAR, for the shipment of certain U.S. Products to certain countries, including China, India, and other countries in which the company operates. The company may not be able to effectively monitor the activities of all of its employees involved in regulated export or shipment activities, which may lead to the company’s failure to prevent violations of such regulations. ​Non-compliance with the EAR, OFAC regulations, or other applicable export regulations can result in a wide range of penalties including the denial or restriction of export privileges, significant fines, criminal penalties, and the seizure of inventories, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business. The company’s distribution process also includes the use of third parties that operate outside of the company’s direct control. Noncompliance with applicable import, export, and other laws and regulations by these third parties may result in substantial liability to the company and harm the company’s reputation.14Table of ContentsFurther, the company is also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. §201, and other national and sub-national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which it conducts business. Anti-corruption laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly. The company can be held liable under these laws for the corrupt or other illegal activities of its employees, agents, contractors, counterparties, and third parties it engages to provide services, even if it does not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. Any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences. The company is subject to environmental laws and regulations and sustainability initiatives, and may be impacted by climate change, in ways that could materially adversely affect its business.A number of jurisdictions in which the company’s products are sold have enacted laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other related matters. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of products sold by the company and impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters. Failure to comply with these laws or any other applicable environmental regulations could result in fines or suspension of sales. Additionally, these directives and regulations may result in the company having non-compliant inventory that may be less readily salable or have to be written off.Certain environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from the company’s currently or formerly owned, leased, or operated property, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination. Under these laws and regulations, the company may be responsible for investigating, removing, or otherwise remediating hazardous substances released at properties or facilities it owns or operates, regardless of when such substances were released. For example, the company assumed responsibility for environmental remediation on two sites that it acquired as part of the Wyle Electronics (“Wyle”) acquisition in August 2000, which such remediation and related assessment remains ongoing. The presence of environmental contamination at any of the company’s locations could also interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect the company’s ability to sell or lease its properties. The discovery of contamination for which the company is responsible, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing regulations are enforced, could require the company to incur costs for compliance or subject it to unexpected liabilities.Additionally, long-term climate change impacts, including the frequency and magnitude of severe weather events, and natural disasters, may significantly impact the company’s operations and business, either directly or indirectly, by adversely affecting the price and availability of energy, and the supply of other services or materials throughout the company’s supply chain, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business. Proposed and existing efforts to address concerns over climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions could also directly or indirectly affect the company’s costs of energy and other operating costs. The company may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees and could limit the company’s ability to use certain technologies in the future.Certain of the company’s products and services include intellectual property owned primarily by the company’s third-party suppliers and, to a lesser extent, the company itself. Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the semiconductor/integrated circuit, software and some service industries. From time to time, third parties (including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent, copyright and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company’s business, and the company may not be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims. In addition, the company is exposed to potential liability for technology that it develops itself or when it combines multiple technologies of its suppliers for which it may have limited or no indemnification protections. In any dispute involving products or services that incorporate intellectual property from multiple sources or that is developed, licensed by the company, or obtained through acquisition, the company’s customers could also become the targets of litigation. The 15Table of Contentscompany may be obligated to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the company sells are alleged to infringe any third-party’s intellectual property rights. Any infringement or indemnification claim brought against the company, regardless of the duration, outcome, or size of damage award, could:•result in substantial cost to the company;•divert management’s attention and resources;•be time consuming to defend;•result in substantial damage awards; or•cause product shipment delays.Additionally, if an infringement claim against the company or its customers is successful, the company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase the company’s operating expenses and materially harm the company’s operating results and financial condition. Further, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all, which would then require the company to stop selling certain products or using certain technologies, which could negatively affect the company’s ability to compete effectively.The company may not be able to adequately anticipate, prevent, or mitigate damage resulting from criminal and other illegal or fraudulent activities committed against it or as a result of misconduct or other improper activities by its employees or contractors.Global businesses are facing increasing risks of criminal, illegal, and other fraudulent acts. Due to the evolving nature of such threats, considering new and sophisticated methods used by criminals, including phishing, misrepresentation, social engineering, and forgery, it is increasingly difficult for the company to anticipate and adequately mitigate these risks. In addition, designing and implementing measures to defend against, prevent, and detect these types of activities are increasingly costly and invasive to the operations of the business. Misconduct or failure of its employees or contractors to adhere to company policy may further heighten such risks. As a result, the company could experience a material loss to the extent that controls and other measures implemented to address these threats fail to prevent or detect such acts.In addition, misconduct by its employees or contractors may include intentional or negligent failures to comply with the applicable laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, safeguard personally identifiable information, report financial information or data accurately, or disclose unauthorized activities to the company. Such misconduct could result in legal or regulatory sanctions and threatened or filed lawsuits on behalf of impacted third-parties, including customers and suppliers, against the company, and, as a result, cause serious harm to the company, including to its reputation.It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and any other precautions the company takes to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses, or in protecting the company from governmental investigations or other actions, including lawsuits on behalf of third-parties, including customers or suppliers, stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against the company, and it is not successful in defending itself or asserting its rights, those actions could result in the imposition of significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, which could have a significant impact on the company’s business. Whether or not the company is successful in defending against such actions, it could incur substantial costs, including legal fees, and divert the attention of management in defending itself against them.16Table of ContentsFinancial RisksThe company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources, which could have a material adverse impact on its ability to maintain cash necessary to operate its business.The company requires cash or committed liquidity facilities for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditure needs, refinancing indebtedness, and returning capital to shareholders. The company’s committed and undrawn liquidity stands at over $2.2 billion in addition to $218.1 million of cash on hand at December 31, 2023. The company’s ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond its control. ​The company’s ability to obtain external financing is affected by various factors, including general financial market conditions and the company’s debt ratings. For example, economic uncertainty or adverse economic conditions resulting from the impacts of and responses to pandemics and other public health issues, natural disasters, changes in global, national, or regional economies, inflation, governmental policies, political unrest, military action and armed conflicts, terrorist activities, political and social turmoil, civil unrest, and other crises could result in significant or sustained disruption of global financial markets, thereby reducing the company’s access to capital.​Further, any increase in the company’s level of debt or deterioration of its operating results may cause a reduction in its current debt ratings. Any downgrade in the company’s current debt rating or tightening of credit availability could impair the company’s ability to obtain additional financing; redeem existing indebtedness or renew existing credit facilities on acceptable terms, if at all; negatively impact the price of the company’s common stock; increase its interest payments under existing debt agreements; and have other negative implications on its business, many of which are beyond the company’s control. Under the terms of any additional external financing, the company may incur higher financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants. For example, the company’s existing debt agreements contain restrictive covenants, including covenants requiring compliance with specified financial ratios, and a failure to comply with these or any other covenants may result in an event of default. An increase in the company’s financing costs or loss of access to cost-effective capital resources could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business.​The agreements governing some of the company’s financing arrangements contain various covenants and restrictions that limit some of management’s discretion in operating the business and could prevent the company from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to its business.The agreements governing some of the company’s financings contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, could limit its ability to:•grant liens on assets;•make investments or certain acquisitions;•merge, consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets;•incur additional debt; or•engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the company may be limited in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, compete effectively, or make investments.Further, if an event of default under any of the company’s existing debt agreements occurred or became imminent, alternative sources of capital may be more expensive than the costs incurred under the company’s existing credit facilities. Further, the company may be unable to borrow additional amounts under the relevant credit facility, and as a result may be unable to make acquisitions, fund share repurchases, or meet other financial obligations, and the lenders thereunder may be able to accelerate the company’s obligations under the credit facility. This circumstance would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations.17Table of ContentsThe company’s goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of its assets and reduce its net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.The company may incur impairment charges on goodwill or identifiable intangible assets if it determines that the fair values of the goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are less than their current carrying values. If events or circumstances occur that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets is or may no longer be recoverable, an impairment charge to earnings may become necessary.A decline in general economic conditions, a substantial increase in market interest rates or persistence of a high market-interest rate environment, and increase in income tax rates, or the company’s inability to meet long-term working capital or operating income projections could impact future valuations of the company’s reporting units, and the company could be required to record an impairment charge in the future, which could impact the company’s consolidated balance sheets, as well as the company’s consolidated statements of operations. If the company were required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the company’s consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, North American asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings.General RisksGeneral business conditions are vulnerable to the effects of epidemics and pandemics which could materially disrupt the company’s business and have a negative impact on the company’s financial results and financial condition.The company is vulnerable to the general economic effects of epidemics, pandemics, and other public health crises. In addition, a U.S. or global recession or a banking crisis triggered by an epidemic, pandemic, or other public health crises could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business, financial results and financial condition, including by reducing the demand for its products and services, reducing the access to its supplies, increasing customer defaults, reducing its access to capital, and reducing the value of its common stock. If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discovers material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.An effective internal control environment is necessary for the company to produce reliable financial reports, safeguard assets, and is an important part of its effort to prevent financial fraud. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment. In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate financial statement risk. If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or the company’s independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls, it may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business. In addition, the company may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or the NYSE. Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the company’s consolidated financial statements, which could cause the market price of its common stock to decline or limit the company’s access to capital.Global, regional, and local economic weakness and uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial performance.The company’s business and financial performance depend on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology products and services in the markets in which the company competes. Ongoing economic weakness, uncertainty in markets throughout the world, and other adverse economic conditions may result in decreased net revenue, gross margin, earnings, growth rates or cash flows, and increased expenses and difficulty managing inventory levels, collecting customer receivables, and accurately forecasting revenue, gross margin, cash flows and expenses. Political developments impacting international trade, trade disputes and increased tariffs, particularly between the United States and China; and political instability, such as armed conflicts (including the conflicts in Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine, and 18Table of ContentsIsrael and the Gaza Strip), each, or collectively may negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions, weakening demand for the company’s products and services, particularly due to the company’s extensive international operations and business. Economic downturns also may lead to future restructuring actions and associated expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business.Expectations relating to environmental, social, and governance considerations and related disclosures expose the company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.​Investors, customers, and other stakeholders are placing substantial emphasis on environmental, social, and governance factors, and the company may be unable to meet investor expectations in this regard. In the event that the company communicates certain initiatives or goals regarding environmental, social, and governance matters, it could fail, or be perceived to fail, in its achievement of such initiatives or goals, or it could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals or even subject to litigation or other liabilities associated with such disclosure. A failure to adequately meet these various stakeholder expectations and standards may result in reputational damage, the loss of business, diluted market valuation, an inability to attract customers or an inability to attract and retain top talent. ​In addition, a number of the company’s customers have adopted, or may adopt, procurement policies that may impose sustainability standards on suppliers. The perceptions held by the company’s shareholders, potential investors, suppliers, customers, other stakeholders, or the communities in which the company does business may depend, in part, on whether the company meets on a timely basis, or at all, the sustainability standards imposed on the company or that the company chooses or aspires to achieve. The subjective nature and wide variety of methods and processes used by various stakeholders, including investors, to assess environmental, social, and governance criteria could result in a negative perception or misrepresentation of the company’s sustainability policies and practices. Also, by electing to establish and publicly disclose the company’s environmental, social, and governance goals, including sustainability standards, the company’s business may face increased scrutiny and potential liability related to such activities, and the company’s reputation could be harmed. In addition, sustainability related laws, regulations, requirements, and initiatives may significantly increase compliance costs. For example, future rules and regulations that provide for enhanced and standardized climate-related disclosures, if adopted, may result in additional legal, accounting, and financial compliances costs; make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly; and strain the company’s personnel, systems, and resources"
8,ARW,ARROW ELECTRONICS INC,2023-02-09,"Risk Factors
.Described below and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” are certain risks that the company’s management believes are applicable to the company’s business and the industries in which it operates. If any of the described events occur, the company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected. When stated below that a risk may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business, it means that such risk may have one or more of these effects. There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known.Business RisksIf the company is unable to maintain its relationships with its suppliers, if the suppliers materially change the terms of their existing agreements with the company, if suppliers cease selling their products through distribution generally, or if supply chain shortages and other disruptions occur, the company’s business could be materially adversely affected. A substantial portion of the company’s inventory is purchased from suppliers with which the company has entered into non-exclusive distribution agreements. These agreements are typically cancellable at any time or on short notice (generally 30 to 90 days). However, the recent global semi-conductor shortages have resulted in some suppliers increasing the amount of non-cancellable orders, which limits the company’s ability to adjust down its inventory levels in the event of market downturns, and could have a negative impact on the financial results of the company, particularly if the company is unable to pass such non-cancellable terms on to customers.Some of the company’s businesses rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide a high percentage of their revenues. For example, sales of products from one of the company’s suppliers accounted for approximately 13% of the company’s consolidated sales in 2022. To the extent that the company’s significant suppliers reduce the number of products they sell through distribution or cease selling their products through distribution entirely, experience disruptions in their supply chains, cease to continue doing business with the company, or are unable to continue to meet or significantly alter their obligations, the company’s business could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, to the extent that the company’s suppliers modify the terms of their contracts to the detriment of the company, limit supplies due to capacity constraints, or other factors, there could be a material adverse effect on the company’s business. Further, the supplier landscape has continued to experience a consolidation, which could negatively impact the company if the surviving, consolidated suppliers decide to exclude the company from their supply chain efforts, and which could expose the company to increased risks, including increased pricing and dependence on a smaller number of suppliers. Increasing consolidation in the industries where the company’s suppliers operate may occur as companies combine to achieve further economies of scale and other synergies, which could result in reduced supplies, as companies seek to eliminate duplicative product lines, and increased prices, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business. The global COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the company's business, particularly in China and the Asia/Pacific region, through significant shortages, disruptions, constraints, extended lead times, and unpredictability across the global supply chain; which has resulted in rapidly changing market conditions, including frequent, and unpredictable, increases in the price of products and services the company sells. Further disruptions to the supply chain due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other global or domestic events could materially adversely impact the company’s business, and the company may not be able to mitigate or prevent disruptions that may arise from shortages, or the other related impacts discussed above, particularly if the company is unable to pass price increases on to customers, or if the company experiences significant decreases in price, or other pricing pressures caused by disruption of the global markets in which it operates. Refer to ""COVID-19 Pandemic Update"" in Management's Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a further discussion about the company's description about the impacts of COVID-19.The company’s revenues originate primarily from the sales of semiconductor, (passive, electro-mechanical and connector) (PEMCO), and IT hardware and software products, the sales of which are traditionally cyclical and may be impacted by shortages and other disruptions in the global supply chain.  The semiconductor industry historically has experienced fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity and subject to significant economic market upturns and downturns. Sales of semiconductor products and related services represented approximately 60%, 57%, and 54%, of the company’s consolidated sales in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The sale of the company’s PEMCO products closely tracks the semiconductor market. Accordingly, the company’s revenues and profitability, particularly in its global components business segment, may be adversely affected by weakness in the semiconductor market. Further, economic weakness could cause a decline in spending in information technology, which could reduce demand for semiconductors and other products and related services and thereby have a negative impact on the company’s ECS business. A cyclical downturn in the technology industry could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and negatively impact its ability to maintain historical profitability levels. 9IndexThe competitive pressures the company faces, such as pricing and margin reductions, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business.The company operates in a highly competitive international environment. The company competes with other large multinational and national electronic components and enterprise computing solutions distributors, as well as numerous other smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on narrower market sectors, products, or industries. The company also competes for customers with its suppliers. The size of the company’s competitors varies across market sectors, as do the resources the company has allocated to the sectors in which it does business. Therefore, some of the company’s competitors may have a more extensive customer and/or supplier base than the company in one or more of its market sectors. There is significant competition within each market sector and geography that creates pricing and margin pressure and the need for constant attention to improve service and product offerings and increase market share. Other competitive factors include rapid technological changes, product availability, credit availability, speed of delivery, ability to tailor solutions to changing customer needs, and quality and depth of product lines and training, as well as service and support provided by the distributor to the customer. The company also faces competition from companies in the logistics and product fulfillment, catalog distribution, e-commerce, and supply chain services markets. As the company continues to expand its business into new areas in order to stay competitive in the market, the company may encounter increased competition from its current and/or new competitors, making it difficult to retain its market share. Further, the enterprise computing solutions industry has recently experienced, and continues to experience increased consolidation, resulting in companies with greater scale, market presence, and purchasing power. As a result, competition among enterprise computing distributors has increased. Declines in value of the company’s inventory could materially adversely affect its business. The market for the company’s products and services is subject to rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, changes in end-market demand, evolving customer expectations, oversupply of product, and regulatory requirements, which can contribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of inventory. Although many of the company’s suppliers provide the company with certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and certain rights of return), the company cannot be sure that such protections will fully compensate it for the loss in value, that the suppliers will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements, or that the company will be able to continue to secure such protections in the future. For example, many of the company’s suppliers will not allow products to be returned after they have been held in inventory beyond a certain amount of time, and, in most instances, the return rights are limited to a certain percentage of the amount of products the company purchased in a particular time frame. Therefore, the company is not fully protected from declines in the value of the company’s inventory, and such decline could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business.The company’s lack of long-term sales contracts may have a material adverse effect on its business. Most of the company’s sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts. The company generally works with its customers to develop non-binding forecasts for future orders. Based on such non-binding forecasts, the company makes commitments regarding the level of business that it will seek and accept, the inventory that it purchases, and the levels of utilization of personnel and other resources. A variety of conditions over which the company has little or no control, both specific to each customer or generally affecting each customer’s industry or the broader market may cause customers to cancel, reduce, or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated, file for bankruptcy protection, or default on their payments. Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays in orders by customers, loss of customers, changing in pricing driven by changing environmental laws and regulations, or the effects of climate change on pricing and sourcing, and/or customer defaults on payments could materially adversely affect the company’s business.The company’s non-U.S. sales represent a significant portion of its revenues, and consequently, the company is exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.In 2022, 2021, and 2020, approximately 65%, 66%, and 65%, respectively, of the company’s sales came from its operations outside the United States. As a result of the company’s international sales and locations, its operations are subject to a variety of risks inherent in international operations, including the following: •import and export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;•the burden and cost of compliance with international laws, regulations, treaties, and technical standards, including with respect to tax; •potential restrictions on transfers of funds;•trade protection measures, import and export tariffs and other restrictions, duties and value-added taxes;•transportation delays and interruptions;•uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations; •foreign laws that potentially discriminate against or disfavor companies headquartered outside the relevant jurisdiction;•stringent antitrust regulations in local jurisdictions;10Index•volatility associated with sovereign debt of certain international economies; •various jurisdictions' environmental protection laws and regulations, including those related to climate change; •potential social unrest, military conflicts, government shutdowns and disruptions, and other geopolitical risks and uncertainties; and•currency fluctuations.Refer to “Impacts of changing foreign currency exchange rates” in Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and “Foreign Currency Exchange Risk” in Item 7.A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for a further discussion of the company’s description of the impacts of foreign currency exchange rates on the company’s results and projections.Further, the company’s gross margins in the components business in the Asia/Pacific region tend to be lower than those in other markets in which the company sells products and services. If sales in this market increase as a percentage of overall sales, consolidated gross margins will be lower.Changes in the company’s global mix of earnings, and changes in tax law and policy, could cause fluctuations in the company's effective tax rate, and could materially adversely impact results.The company’s effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by, among other things, changes in the geographic mix of earnings that are subject to income taxes both in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Tax regulations governing each jurisdiction impact statutory tax rates, deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, and ultimately income taxes payable. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the company’s determination of the value of its deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions.The estimated effects of applicable tax laws, including current interpretation of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, have been incorporated into the company’s financial results. However, the U.S. Department of Treasury, Internal Revenue Service (""IRS""), and other standard-setting bodies could issue future legislation or guidance that might be different from the company’s interpretation. In addition, many global political leaders have recently committed to adopt fundamental changes to international taxation based on a proposal from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Framework), including the potential for a new global minimum tax regime, amongst other proposals. Such tax developments could further increase uncertainty and have a material adverse impact on the company’s cash flows, effective tax rate and financial results. Additional changes to U.S. or foreign tax laws could have broader implications, including impacts to the economy, currency markets, inflation or competitive dynamics, which are difficult to predict, and may positively or negatively impact the company.Additionally, the company’s tax returns are subject to periodic audits by U.S. and foreign tax authorities. These audits may result in global reallocation of income and expense that is different from what has been estimated in the company's financial results. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of such adverse outcomes to ensure the adequacy of its tax provision and financial results. Such tax audit developments could have an adverse effect on the company’s tax liability, increase effective tax rates, increase the complexity and cost of tax compliance, all of which could impact the company’s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.When the company makes acquisitions, it may take on additional liabilities or may not be able to successfully integrate such acquisitions.As part of the company’s history and growth strategy, it has acquired other businesses. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:•effectively combining the acquired operations, technologies, or products;•unanticipated costs or assumed liabilities, including those associated with regulatory actions or investigations;•not realizing the anticipated financial benefit from the acquired companies;•diversion of management’s attention;•negative effects on existing customer and supplier relationships; and•potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies.Further, the company has made, and may continue to make acquisitions of, or investments in new services, businesses or technologies to expand its current service offerings and product lines. Some of these may involve risks that may differ from those traditionally associated with the company’s core distribution business. In addition, the company's effective tax rate for future periods could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions. If the company is not successful in mitigating or insuring against such risks, it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business.11IndexIf the company is not able to invest successfully in and introduce digital and other technological developments, or its suppliers are not able to continue to offer competitive components and electronic computing solutions, it could materially adversely impact results. The company’s industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes, and the company’s ability to meet its customers’ needs and expectations is key to the company’s ability to grow sales and earnings. The company expects digital technologies to have a significant impact on distribution of components and electronic computing solutions over time, and its customers increasingly expect the company’s platforms to offer a digital customer experience. For example, the ability for customers to access their accounts, place orders, and otherwise interface with the company using digital technology is an important aspect of the distribution industry, and distribution companies are rapidly introducing new digital and other technology-driven products and services that aim to offer a better customer experience and reduce costs.The company’s sales are also partially dependent on continued innovations in components and electronic computing solutions by its suppliers, the competitiveness of its suppliers’ offerings, and the company’s ability to partner with new and emerging technology providers. See also “The competitive pressures the company faces, such as pricing and margin reductions, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business”. Operational RisksThe company’s success depends upon its ability to attract, retain, motivate, and develop key executive and employee talent and the strategies they develop and implement.Any failure to attract, retain, motivate, and develop key executive and employee talent may materially and adversely affect the company’s business. The company’s success depends, to a significant extent, on the capability, expertise, and continued services of its key executives. The company relies on the expertise and experience of certain key executives in developing business strategies, business operations, and maintaining relationships with customers and suppliers. If the company were to lose any of its key executives, it may not be able to find a suitable replacement with comparable knowledge and experience in a timely manner, or if at all, at a similar level of remuneration and other benefits. Additionally, management transitions, such as the company's transition to a new Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in 2022, may create uncertainty, divert resources and management attention, or impact public or market perception, any of which could negatively impact the company's ability to operate effectively or execute its strategies and result in an adverse impact on its business. Further, these new executives may have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served in these roles and thus may have different views on the issues that will determine the company’s future, potentially resulting in employee, customer, and supplier uncertainty.The company relies heavily on its internal information systems, which, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect the company’s business.The company’s current global operations reside on multiple technology platforms. The size and complexity of the company’s computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, and random attack. Failure to properly or adequately address any unaccounted for or unforeseen issues could impact the company’s ability to perform necessary business operations, which could materially adversely affect the company’s business.The ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia could adversely affect the company's results of operations, consolidated financial condition, and business.Russia’s military actions against Ukraine have led to an unprecedented expansion of export restrictions and sanctions imposed by the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and numerous other countries against Russia and Belarus. In addition, Russian authorities have imposed significant currency control measures, other sanctions and imposed other economic and financial restrictions. The situation is rapidly evolving, and further sanctions and export restrictions could negatively impact the global economy and financial markets and could adversely affect the company’s business.The company cannot predict the progress, outcome, or impact of the conflict in Ukraine, Russia, or Belarus as the conflict, and any resulting government reactions are beyond the company’s control. The company is actively monitoring the conflict in Ukraine to assess its impact on its business, as well as on the company’s vendors, suppliers, customers, and other parties with whom the company does business.12IndexCyber Risk Cyber security and privacy incidents as well as ransomware may hurt the company’s business, damage its reputation, increase its costs, and cause losses.The company’s information technology systems could be subject to cyber security and privacy incidents, including, but not limited to, invasion, fraudulent inducement by third parties of sensitive information from employees, customers, or suppliers; cyber-attacks; ransom demands; or data privacy breaches by unauthorized persons as well as employees and others with authorized access. Such attacks could result in disruption to the company’s operations and/or loss or compromise of, or damage to, the company’s or any of its customers’ or suppliers’ data, confidential information, or reputation. Any such incident, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in, without limitation, significant legal, regulatory, and financial exposure, damage to the company’s reputation, significant costs related to rebuilding internal systems, managing company brand and reputation, litigation, damages, responding to regulatory inquiries, and taking other remedial steps; loss of competitive advantage; and a loss of confidence in the security of the company’s information technology systems, in each case, that could potentially have an adverse impact on the company’s business. Because the techniques used to gain unauthorized access, disable, or sabotage the company’s information technology systems and data stored on those systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched, the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive or protective measures. Further, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, could be a source of risk in the event of a failure of their own systems and infrastructure or could experience their own privacy or security event which could create risks similar to those described above.Global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity are also rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. The company’s actual or perceived failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.Regulatory and Legal RisksProducts sold by the company may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against the company, which may have a material adverse effect on the company. The company sells its components at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. As a result, the company may face claims for damages (such as consequential damages) that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits it receives from the components involved in the claims. Further, the company’s ability to avoid such liabilities pursuant to defective product provisions in its supplier agreements may be limited as a result of differing factors, such as the inability to exclude such damages due to the laws of some of the countries where the company does business. The company’s business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in the products sold by the company, if it is required to pay for the associated damages. The company's product liability insurance is limited in coverage and amount and may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims. Further, when relying on contractual liability exclusions, the company could lose customers if their claims are not addressed to their satisfaction. Tariffs may result in increased prices and could adversely affect the company’s business and results of operations.In recent years, the U.S. government has imposed tariffs on certain products imported into the U.S., and the Chinese government has imposed tariffs on certain products imported into China, which have increased the prices of many of the products that the company purchases from its suppliers. The tariffs, along with any additional tariffs or trade restrictions that may be implemented by the U.S., China, or other countries, could result in further increased prices. While the company may be able to pass any price increases on to its customers, the effect of tariffs on prices may impact sales and results of operations. Retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods have not yet had a significant impact, but the company cannot predict further developments. Tariffs and the additional operational costs incurred in minimizing the number of products subject to the tariffs could adversely affect the operating profits for certain of the company’s businesses and customer demand for certain products, which could have an adverse effect on its business and results of operations.In addition, if the company pays tariffs for products it imports from China which are then re-exported to other locations outside of the United States, the company may be eligible for refunds of certain tariffs. To qualify for these tariff drawbacks, the company must provide data and documentation to the U.S. government that it must obtain from third party sources, such as its suppliers, which the company may not be able to source and could result in the U.S. government rejecting the drawback requests. Qualifying for tariff drawbacks also requires administrative cost. Due to the backlog of drawback applications, the U.S. government has been slow in issuing the associated drawback refunds, and the company’s inability to obtain the drawback refunds or significant delays in receiving them could result in a material adverse effect on the company’s business.13IndexThe company is subject to U.S. and certain foreign export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti-corruption laws, anti-bribery laws, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. In the event of non-compliance, the company can face serious consequences, which can harm its business. The company is subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), U.S. Customs regulations, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls (“OFAC”). Products the company sells which are either manufactured in the United States or based on U.S. technology (“U.S. Products”) are subject to the EAR when exported and re-exported to and from all international jurisdictions, in addition to the local jurisdiction’s export regulations applicable to individual shipments. Licenses or proper license exemptions may be required by local jurisdictions’ export regulations, including EAR, for the shipment of certain U.S. Products to certain countries, including China, India, Russia, and other countries in which the company operates. Non-compliance with the EAR, OFAC regulations, or other applicable export regulations can result in a wide range of penalties including the denial of export privileges, fines, criminal penalties, and the seizure of inventories. In the event that any export regulatory body determines that any shipments made by the company violate the applicable export regulations, the company could be fined significant sums and/or its export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business. For example, as described in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, filed on February 11, 2022, the company facilitated product shipments to persons covered by the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 or other United States sanctions and export control laws. The company’s distribution process also includes the use of third parties that operate outside of the company’s direct control. Noncompliance with applicable import, export, and other laws and regulations by these third parties may negatively impact the company.Further, the company is also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. §201, and other national and sub-national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which it conducts business. Anti-corruption laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years, are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors, and other affiliated parties from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or transfers of money or anything else of value to recipients in the public or private sector. The company engages third parties to provide services. The company can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of its employees, agents, contractors, and counterparties, even if it does not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. Any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences.The company is subject to environmental laws and regulations and sustainability initiatives, and may be impacted by climate change, in ways that could materially adversely affect its business. A number of jurisdictions in which the company’s products are sold have enacted laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other related matters. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of products sold by the company and impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters. Failure to comply with these laws or any other applicable environmental regulations could result in fines or suspension of sales. Additionally, these directives and regulations may result in the company having non-compliant inventory that may be less readily salable or have to be written off. Certain environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from the company’s currently or formerly owned, leased, or operated property, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination. Under these laws and regulations, the company may be responsible for investigating, removing, or otherwise remediating hazardous substances released at properties or facilities it owns or operates, regardless of when such substances were released. As the distribution business, in general, does not involve the manufacture of products, it is typically not subject to significant liability in this area. However, there may be occasions, including through acquisitions, where environmental liability arises. For example, the company assumed responsibility for environmental remediation on two sites that it acquired as part of the Wyle Electronics (“Wyle”) acquisition in August 2000, which such remediation and related assessment remains ongoing. The company was also named as a defendant in a private lawsuit filed in connection with alleged contamination at a small industrial building formerly leased by Wyle Laboratories in El Segundo, California. That lawsuit was ultimately settled, but the possibility remains that government entities or others may attempt to involve the company in further characterization or remediation of groundwater issues in the area. The presence of environmental contamination at any of the company's locations could also interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect the company’s ability to sell or lease its properties. The discovery of contamination for which the company is responsible, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing regulations are enforced, could require the company to incur costs for compliance or subject it to unexpected liabilities. 14IndexAdditionally, long-term climate change impacts, including the frequency and magnitude of severe weather events, and natural disasters, may significantly impact the company’s operations and business, either directly or indirectly, by adversely affecting the price and availability of energy, and the supply of other services or materials throughout the company’s supply chain, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business.Proposed and existing efforts to address concerns over climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions could directly or indirectly affect the company’s costs of energy and other operating costs. Investors, customers, and other stakeholders are also placing a greater emphasis on environmental, social, and governance factors, and the company may be unable to meet investor expectations in this regard. In the event that the company communicates certain initiatives or goals regarding environmental, social, and governance matters, it could fail, or be perceived to fail, in its achievement of such initiatives or goals, or it could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals. A failure to adequately meet these various stakeholder expectations and standards may result in reputational damage, the loss of business, diluted market valuation, an inability to attract customers or an inability to attract and retain top talent. In addition, a number of the company’s customers have adopted, or may adopt, procurement policies that may impose sustainability standards on suppliers. The perceptions held by the company’s shareholders, potential investors, suppliers, customers, other stakeholders, or the communities in which the company does business may depend, in part, on whether the company meets on a timely basis or at all the sustainability standards imposed on the company or that the company chooses or aspires to achieve. The subjective nature and wide variety of methods and processes used by various stakeholders, including investors, to assess environmental, social, and governance criteria could result in a negative perception or misrepresentation of the company’s sustainability policies and practices. Also, by electing to establish and publicly share the company’s sustainability standards, the company’s business may face increased scrutiny related to sustainability activities, and the company’s reputation could be harmed. In addition, sustainability related laws, regulations, requirements, and initiatives may increase compliance costs. For example, future rules and regulations that provide for enhanced and standardized climate-related disclosures, if adopted, may result in additional legal, accounting, and financial compliances costs; make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly; and strain the company’s personnel, systems, and resources.The company may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees and could limit the company’s ability to use certain technologies in the future.Certain of the company’s products and services include intellectual property owned primarily by the company’s third party suppliers and, to a lesser extent, the company itself. Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the semiconductor/integrated circuit, software and some service industries. From time to time, third parties (including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent, copyright and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company’s business, and the company may not be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims. In addition, the company is exposed to potential liability for technology that it develops itself or when it combines multiple technologies of its suppliers for which it may have limited or no indemnification protections. In any dispute involving products or services that incorporate intellectual property from multiple sources or that is developed, licensed by the company, or obtained through acquisition, the company’s customers could also become the targets of litigation. The company may be obligated to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the company sells are alleged to infringe any third party’s intellectual property rights. Any infringement or indemnification claim brought against the company, regardless of the duration, outcome, or size of damage award, could:•result in substantial cost to the company;•divert management’s attention and resources;•be time consuming to defend;•result in substantial damage awards; or•cause product shipment delays.Additionally, if an infringement claim against the company or its customers is successful, the company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase the company’s operating expenses and materially harm the company’s operating results and financial condition. Further, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all, which would then require the company to stop selling certain products or using certain technologies, which could negatively affect the company’s ability to compete effectively. 15IndexRestrictions on immigration or changes in immigration laws could limit the company’s access to qualified and skilled professionals, increase the cost of doing business, or otherwise disrupt operations.Restrictions on immigration or changes in immigration laws could limit the company’s access to qualified and skilled professionals, increase the cost of doing business, or otherwise disrupt operations. The success of portions of the company’s business is dependent on its ability to recruit engineers and other professionals. Immigration laws in the United States and other countries in which the company operates are subject to legislative changes, as well as variations in the standards of application and enforcement due to political forces and economic conditions. It is difficult to predict the political and economic events that could affect immigration laws, or the restrictive impact they could have on obtaining or renewing work visas. If immigration laws change or if more restrictive government regulations are enacted, the company’s access to qualified and skilled professionals may be limited, the costs of doing business may increase, operations may be disrupted, and the company’s business may be materially negatively impacted.The company may not be able to adequately anticipate, prevent, or mitigate damage resulting from criminal and other illegal or fraudulent activities committed against it or as a result of misconduct or other improper activities by its employees or contractors.Global businesses are facing increasing risks of criminal, illegal, and other fraudulent acts.  Due to the evolving nature of such threats, considering new and sophisticated methods used by criminals, including phishing, misrepresentation, social engineering, and forgery, it is increasingly difficult for the company to anticipate and adequately mitigate these risks. In addition, designing and implementing measures to defend against, prevent, and detect these types of activities are increasingly costly and invasive to the operations of the business. Misconduct or failure of its employees or contractors to adhere to company policy may further heighten such risks. As a result, the company could experience a material loss to the extent that controls and other measures implemented to address these threats fail to prevent or detect such acts.In addition, misconduct by its employees or contractors may include intentional or negligent failures to comply with the applicable laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, safeguard personally identifiable information, report financial information or data accurately, or disclose unauthorized activities to the company. Such misconduct could result in legal or regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to the company, including to its reputation.It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and any other precautions the company takes to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses, or in protecting the company from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against the company, and it is not successful in defending itself or asserting its rights, those actions could result in the imposition of significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, which could have a significant impact on the company’s business. Whether or not the company is successful in defending against such actions or investigations, it could incur substantial costs, including legal fees, and divert the attention of management in defending itself against any of these claims or investigations.Financial RisksThe company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources. The company requires cash or committed liquidity facilities for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital, acquisitions, and capital expenditure needs, as well as to refinance indebtedness. At December 31, 2022, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $176.9 million. In addition, the company currently has access to a committed revolving credit line of $2.0 billion and a committed North American asset securitization program of $1.5 billion, of which the company had $1.2 billion in outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2022. The company’s ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond its control. The company may, in the future, need to access the financial markets to satisfy its cash needs. The company’s ability to obtain external financing is affected by various factors, including general financial market conditions and the company’s debt ratings. For example, economic uncertainty or adverse economic conditions resulting from the impacts of and responses to pandemics and other public health issues (including the COVID-19 pandemic), natural disasters, changes in global, national, or regional economies, inflation, governmental policies, political unrest, military action and armed conflicts (such as the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine), terrorist activities, political and social turmoil, civil unrest, and other crises could result in significant or sustained disruption of global financial markets, thereby reducing the company’s access to capital.Further, any increase in the company’s level of debt or deterioration of its operating results may cause a reduction in its current debt ratings. Any downgrade in the company’s current debt rating or tightening of credit availability could impair the 16Indexcompany’s ability to obtain additional financing, redeem existing indebtedness, or renew existing credit facilities on acceptable terms, if at all, negatively impact the price of the company’s common stock, increase its interest payments under existing debt agreements and have other negative implications on its business, many of which are beyond the company’s control. Under the terms of any additional external financing, the company may incur higher financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants. For example, the company’s existing debt agreements contain restrictive covenants, including covenants requiring compliance with specified financial ratios, and a failure to comply with these or any other covenants may result in an event of default. An increase in the company’s financing costs or loss of access to cost-effective capital resources could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business.The agreements governing some of the company’s financing arrangements contain various covenants and restrictions that limit some of management’s discretion in operating the business and could prevent the company from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to its business.The agreements governing some of the company’s financings contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, could limit its ability to:•grant liens on assets;•make investments or certain acquisitions;•merge, consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets;•incur additional debt; or•engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the company may be limited in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, compete effectively, or make investments.Further, if an event of default under any of the company’s existing debt agreements occurred or became imminent, alternative sources of capital may be more expensive than the costs incurred under the company’s existing credit facilities. Further, the company may be unable to borrow additional amounts under the existing credit facility, and as a result may be unable to make acquisitions, fund share repurchases, or meet other financial obligations, and the lenders thereunder may be able to accelerate the company’s obligations under the credit facility. This circumstance would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations.The company’s goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of its assets and reduce its net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.The company may incur impairment charges on goodwill or identifiable intangible assets if it determines that the fair values of the goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are less than their current carrying values. If events or circumstances occur that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets is or may no longer be recoverable, an impairment charge to earnings may become necessary. A decline in general economic conditions, a substantial increase in market interest rates, and increase in income tax rates, or the company’s inability to meet long-term working capital or operating income projections could impact future valuations of the company’s reporting units, and the company could be required to record an impairment charge in the future, which could impact the company’s consolidated balance sheets, as well as the company’s consolidated statements of operations. If the company were required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the company’s consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, North American asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings.General RisksIf the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discovers material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.An effective internal control environment is necessary for the company to produce reliable financial reports, safeguard assets, and is an important part of its effort to prevent financial fraud. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment. In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate financial statement risk. If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or the company’s independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls, it may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business. In addition, the company may be subject to sanctions or investigation by 17Indexregulatory authorities, such as the SEC or the NYSE. Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the company’s consolidated financial statements, which could cause the market price of its common stock to decline or limit the company’s access to capital.General business conditions are vulnerable to the effects of epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which could materially disrupt the company’s business and have a negative impact on the company’s financial results and financial condition.The company is vulnerable to the general economic effects of epidemics, pandemics, and other public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The global COVID-19 pandemic continues to create macroeconomic uncertainty, volatility, and disruption, including supply constraints, extended lead times, and unpredictability across many markets. Supply chain logistical issues due to shutdowns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in China, are resulting in extended lead times and unpredictability. The extent to which COVID-19 and ensuing challenges such as supply chain constraints will continue to impact the company’s results remains uncertain considering the rapidly evolving environment, duration, and severity of the spread of COVID-19, emerging variants, and vaccine booster effectiveness, among others. In addition, a U.S. or global recession or a banking crisis triggered by a pandemic, including the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business, financial results and financial condition, including by reducing the demand for its products and services, reducing the access to its supplies, increasing customer defaults, reducing its access to capital, and reducing the value of its common stock. Refer to ""COVID-19 Pandemic Update"" in Management's Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a further discussion about the company's description about the impacts of COVID-19.Global, regional and local economic weakness and uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial performance.The company’s business and financial performance depend on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology products and services in the markets in which the company competes. Ongoing economic weakness, uncertainty in markets throughout the world, and other adverse economic conditions may result in decreased net revenue, gross margin, earnings, growth rates or cash flows, and in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels, collecting customer receivables, and accurately forecasting revenue, gross margin, cash flows and expenses.  Political developments impacting international trade, trade disputes and increased tariffs, particularly between the United States and China, may negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions, weakening demand for the company's products and services.Poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and post-retirement benefit expenses. Economic downturns also may lead to future restructuring actions and associated expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business"
13,ARW,ARROW ELECTRONICS INC,2022-02-11,"Risk Factors
.Described below and throughout this report are certain risks that the company’s management believes are applicable to the company’s business and the industries in which it operates. Please see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” for a discussion of the company's market risk. If any of the described events occur, the company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected. When stated below that a risk may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business, it means that such risk may have one or more of these effects. There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known. There are also risks within the economy, the industry, and the capital markets that could materially adversely affect the company, including those associated with an economic recession, inflation, a global economic slowdown, political instability, government regulation (including tax regulation), climate change, employee attraction and retention, and customers’ inability or refusal to pay for the products and services provided by the company. There are also risks associated with the occurrence of extraordinary or unforeseen events, such as terrorist attacks, military or political conflicts, epidemics or pandemics, natural disasters (such as tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods), or other catastrophic events. These factors affect businesses generally, including the company, its customers and suppliers, and as a result, are not discussed in detail below, but are applicable to the company.Operational RisksIf the company is unable to maintain its relationships with its suppliers or if the suppliers materially change the terms of their existing agreements with the company, or if supply chain shortages and other disruptions occur, the company’s business could be materially adversely affected. A substantial portion of the company’s inventory is purchased from suppliers with which the company has entered into non-exclusive distribution agreements. These agreements are typically cancellable at any time or on short notice (generally 30 to 90 days). However, the recent global semi-conductor shortages have resulted in some suppliers increasing the amount of non-cancelable orders, which limits our ability to adjust down our inventory levels in the event of market downturns, and could have a negative impact on the financial results of the company. The company seeks to limit these risks by passing non-cancellable terms on to customers, where possible.Some of the company’s businesses rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide a high percentage of their revenues. For example, sales of products from one of the company’s suppliers accounted for approximately 17% of the company’s consolidated sales in 2021. To the extent that the company’s significant suppliers reduce the number of products they sell through distribution, experience disruptions in their supply chains, cease to continue doing business with the company, or are unable to continue to meet or significantly alter their obligations, the company’s business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, to the extent that the company’s suppliers modify the terms of their contracts to the detriment of the company, limit supplies due to capacity constraints, or other factors, there could be a material adverse effect on the company’s business. Further, the supplier landscape has continued to experience a consolidation, which could negatively impact the company if the surviving, consolidated suppliers decide to exclude the company from their supply chain efforts, and which could expose the company to increased risks, including increased pricing and dependence on a smaller number of suppliers. Increasing consolidation in the industries where the company’s suppliers operate may occur as companies combine to achieve further economies of scale and other synergies, which could result in reduced supplies, as companies seek to eliminate duplicative product lines, and increased prices, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business. The global COVID-19 pandemic has created and continues to create significant shortages, disruptions, constraints, extended lead times, and unpredictability across the global supply chain. Shortages in electronics components markets and supply chain logistical issues have impacted the company's business. The extent to which supply constraints will continue to impact the company's results will depend on future developments, including the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of actions to contain or treat its impact, among others. These future developments are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.The company’s revenues originate primarily from the sales of semiconductor, PEMCO (passive, electro-mechanical and connector), and IT hardware and software products, the sales of which are traditionally cyclical and may be impacted by shortages and other disruptions in the global supply chain. The semiconductor industry historically has experienced fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity and subject to significant economic market upturns and downturns. The COVID-19 pandemic has created and continues to create significant shortages, disruptions, constraints, extended lead times and unpredictability in the global supply chain and especially in the semiconductor market. Sales of semiconductor products and 9related services represented approximately 57%, 54%, and 49%, of the company’s consolidated sales in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The sale of the company’s PEMCO products closely tracks the semiconductor market. Accordingly, the company’s revenues and profitability, particularly in its global components business segment, tend to closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market. Further, economic weakness could cause a decline in spending in information technology, which could have a negative impact on the company’s ECS business. A cyclical downturn in the technology industry could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and negatively impact its ability to maintain historical profitability levels.The competitive pressures the company faces, such as pricing and margin reductions, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business.The company operates in a highly competitive international environment. The company competes with other large multinational and national electronic components and enterprise computing solutions distributors, as well as numerous other smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on narrower market sectors, products, or industries. The company also competes for customers with its suppliers. The size of the company’s competitors varies across market sectors, as do the resources the company has allocated to the sectors in which it does business. Therefore, some of the company’s competitors may have a more extensive customer and/or supplier base than the company in one or more of its market sectors. There is significant competition within each market sector and geography that creates pricing and margin pressure and the need for constant attention to improve service and product offerings and increase market share. Other competitive factors include rapid technological changes, product availability, credit availability, speed of delivery, ability to tailor solutions to changing customer needs, and quality and depth of product lines and training, as well as service and support provided by the distributor to the customer. The company also faces competition from companies in the logistics and product fulfillment, catalog distribution, and e-commerce supply chain services markets. As the company continues to expand its business into new areas in order to stay competitive in the market, the company may encounter increased competition from its current and/or new competitors, making it difficult to retain its market share. Further, the enterprise computing distributors industry has recently experienced increased consolidation, resulting in companies with greater scale, market presence, and purchasing power than before. As a result, competition among enterprise computing distributors has increased. In addition, there is no guarantee that the company’s response to and growth in emerging technologies will be successful. Also, customers may seek commitments from the company related to sustainability and environmental impacts, and meeting these commitments may increase the company's cost of operations. The company’s failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could have a material adverse effect on its business.Declines in value of the company’s inventory could materially adversely affect its business. The market for the company’s products and services is subject to rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, changes in end-market demand, evolving customer expectations, oversupply of product, and regulatory requirements, which can contribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of inventory. Although many of the company’s suppliers provide the company with certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and certain rights of return), the company cannot be sure that such protections will fully compensate it for the loss in value, or that the suppliers will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements. For example, many of the company’s suppliers will not allow products to be returned after they have been held in inventory beyond a certain amount of time, and, in most instances, the return rights are limited to a certain percentage of the amount of products the company purchased in a particular time frame. Therefore, the company is not fully protected from declines in the value of the company’s inventory, and such decline could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business.The company’s lack of long-term sales contracts may have a material adverse effect on its business.Most of the company’s sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts. The company generally works with its customers to develop non-binding forecasts for future orders. Based on such non-binding forecasts, the company makes commitments regarding the level of business that it will seek and accept, the inventory that it purchases, and the levels of utilization of personnel and other resources. A variety of conditions over which the company has little or no control, both specific to each customer and generally affecting each customer’s industry may cause customers to cancel, reduce, or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated, file for bankruptcy protection, or default on their payments. Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays in orders by customers, loss of customers, changing in pricing driven by changing environmental laws and regulations, or the effects of climate change on pricing and sourcing, and/or customer defaults on payments could materially adversely affect the company’s business.10The company’s non-U.S. sales represent a significant portion of its revenues, and consequently, the company is exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.In 2021, 2020, and 2019, approximately 66%, 65%, and 60%, respectively, of the company’s sales came from its operations outside the United States. As a result of the company’s international sales and locations, its operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following: •import and export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;•the burden and cost of compliance with international laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations; •potential restrictions on transfers of funds;•trade protection measures, import and export tariffs and other restrictions, duties and value-added taxes;•transportation delays and interruptions;•the burden and cost of compliance with complex multi-national tax laws and regulations;•uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations; •foreign laws that potentially discriminate against companies which are headquartered outside that jurisdiction;•stringent antitrust regulations in local jurisdictions;•volatility associated with sovereign debt of certain international economies;•the uncertainty surrounding the effects of Brexit; •environmental protection laws and regulations, including those related to climate change;•potential social unrest, military conflicts, government shutdowns and disruptions, and political risks; and•currency fluctuations, which the company attempts to minimize through traditional hedging instruments.Also, the company’s gross margins in the components business in the Asia-Pacific region tend to be lower than those in other markets in which the company sells products and services. If sales in this market increase as a percentage of overall sales, consolidated gross margins will be lower. While the company has and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the risks of doing business abroad, it cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate and, therefore, such risks could have a material adverse effect on its business.Changes in the company’s global mix of earnings, and changes in tax law and policy, could materially adversely impact results.The company’s effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by, among other things, changes in the mix of earnings among countries having different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets, and certain U.S. and international tax policy and enforcement efforts, including the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, the European Commission’s state aid investigations, and other initiatives adversely affecting taxation of international businesses. For example, in October 2021, a substantial majority of the OECD’s participating countries and jurisdictions agreed to introduce a 15% global minimum corporate tax rate that would apply to companies with revenue over a set threshold and that could be assessed potentially as early as 2023. Furthermore, many of the countries where the company is subject to taxes are independently evaluating their corporate tax policy, which could result in tax legislation and enforcement that adversely impacts the company’s tax provision and value of deferred assets and liabilities. For instance, proposed legislation in the U.S. includes a new 15% corporate profits minimum tax on corporations that report over $1 billion of profits to shareholders, a new 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases, limitations on interest deductions of international financial reporting groups, and increases to the tax rate applied to profits earned outside the U.S. Additionally, tax returns are subject to periodic audits by U.S. and foreign tax authorities, and these audits may result in allocations of income and/or deductions that may result in tax assessments different from amounts that have been estimated. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these audits to determine the adequacy of the company’s provision for taxes. Such tax changes could increase the effective tax rates in many of the countries where the company has operations and ultimately could have an adverse effect on overall tax liability, along with increasing the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance, all of which could impact the company’s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.11When the company makes acquisitions, it may take on additional liabilities or may not be able to successfully integrate such acquisitions.As part of the company’s history and growth strategy, it has acquired other businesses. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:•effectively combining the acquired operations, technologies, or products;•unanticipated costs or assumed liabilities, including those associated with regulatory actions or investigations;•not realizing the anticipated financial benefit from the acquired companies;•diversion of management’s attention;•negative effects on existing customer and supplier relationships; and•potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies.Further, the company has made, and may continue to make acquisitions of, or investments in new services, businesses or technologies to expand its current service offerings and product lines. Some of these may involve risks that may differ from those traditionally associated with the company’s core distribution business, including undertaking product or service warranty responsibilities that in its traditional core business would generally reside primarily with its suppliers. In addition, our effective tax rate for future periods could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions. If the company is not successful in mitigating or insuring against such risks, it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business.The company relies heavily on its internal information systems, which, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect the company’s business.The company’s current global operations reside on multiple technology platforms.  The size and complexity of the company’s computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, and random attack. Failure to properly or adequately address any unaccounted for or unforeseen issues could impact the company’s ability to perform necessary business operations, which could materially adversely affect the company’s business.Regulatory and Legal RisksProducts sold by the company may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against the company, which may have a material adverse effect on the company. The company sells its components at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. As a result, the company may face claims for damages (such as consequential damages) that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits it receives from the components involved in the claims. While the company typically has provisions in its supplier agreements that hold the supplier accountable for defective products, and the company and its suppliers generally exclude consequential damages in their standard terms and conditions, the company’s ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited as a result of differing factors, such as the inability to exclude such damages due to the laws of some of the countries where the company does business. The company’s business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in the products sold by the company, if it is required to pay for the associated damages. Although the company currently has product liability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage and amount and may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims. Further, when relying on contractual liability exclusions, the company could lose customers if their claims are not addressed to their satisfaction. Tariffs may result in increased prices and could adversely affect the company’s business and results of operations.In recent years, the U.S. government has imposed tariffs on certain products imported into the United States and the Chinese government has imposed tariffs on certain products imported into China, which have increased the prices of many of the products that the company purchases from its suppliers. The tariffs, along with any additional tariffs or trade restrictions that may be implemented by the U.S., China, or other countries, could result in further increased prices. While the company intends to pass price increases on to its customers, the effect of tariffs on prices may impact sales and results of operations. Retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods have not yet had a significant impact, but the company cannot predict further developments. The tariffs and the additional operational costs incurred in minimizing the number of products subject to the tariffs could adversely affect the operating profits for certain of the company’s businesses and customer demand for certain products which could have an adverse effect on its business and results of operations.12In addition, in the event that the company pays tariffs for products it imports from China which are then re-exported to other locations outside of the United States, the company may be eligible for refunds of certain tariffs. In order to qualify for these tariff drawbacks, the company must provide data and documentation to the U.S. government that it must obtain from third-party sources, such as its suppliers. There is no guarantee the company will be able to obtain this additional data and documentation from those other sources, which could result in the U.S. government rejecting the drawback requests. Further, there are additional administrative costs expended by the company in furtherance of these efforts. Finally, due to the backlog of drawback applications, the U.S. government has been slow in issuing the associated drawback refunds. The company’s inability to obtain the drawback refunds or significant delays in receiving them could result in a material adverse effect on the company’s business.The company is subject to U.S. and certain foreign export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti-corruption laws, anti-bribery laws, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. In the event of non-compliance, the company can face serious consequences, which can harm its business. The company is subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), U.S. Customs regulations, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls (“OFAC”). Products the company sells which are either manufactured in the United States or based on U.S. technology (“U.S. Products”) are subject to the EAR when exported and re-exported to and from all international jurisdictions, in addition to the local jurisdiction’s export regulations applicable to individual shipments. Licenses or proper license exemptions may be required by local jurisdictions’ export regulations, including EAR, for the shipment of certain U.S. Products to certain countries, including China, India, Russia, and other countries in which the company operates. Non-compliance with the EAR, OFAC regulations, or other applicable export regulations can result in a wide range of penalties including the denial of export privileges, fines, criminal penalties, and the seizure of inventories. In the event that any export regulatory body determines that any shipments made by the company violate the applicable export regulations, the company could be fined significant sums and/or its export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business. For example, in 2019, the company determined that from 2015 to 2019 a limited number of non-executive employees, without first obtaining required authorization from the company or the United States government, had facilitated product shipments with an aggregate total invoiced value of approximately $4.8 million, to resellers for reexports to persons covered by the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 or other United States sanctions and export control laws. The company has voluntarily reported these activities to OFAC and the United States Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”), conducted an internal investigation and terminated or disciplined the employees involved. BIS has closed its investigation and issued the company a warning letter without referring the matter for further proceedings. No penalties have been imposed by BIS. The company has cooperated fully and intends to continue to cooperate fully with OFAC with respect to its review, which may result in the imposition of penalties, the magnitude of which the company is currently not able to estimate. In addition, the company’s distribution process includes the use of third parties that operate outside of the company’s direct control. Although the company conducts risk based due diligence on third parties in its distribution supply chain, noncompliance with applicable import, export, and other laws and regulations by these third parties may negatively impact the company.Further, the company is also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. §201, and other national and sub-national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which it conducts business. Anti-corruption laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years, are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors, and other affiliated parties from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or transfers of money or anything else of value to recipients in the public or private sector. The company engages third parties to provide services. The company can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of its employees, agents, contractors, and counterparties, even if it does not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. While the company has policies and procedures to foster compliance, any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences.The company is subject to environmental laws and regulations and sustainability initiatives, and may be impacted by climate change, in ways that could materially adversely affect its business. A number of jurisdictions in which the company’s products are sold have enacted laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other related matters. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of products sold by the company and impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters. Failure to comply with these laws or any other applicable environmental 13regulations could result in fines or suspension of sales. Additionally, these directives and regulations may result in the company having non-compliant inventory that may be less readily salable or have to be written off. Some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from the company’s currently or formerly owned, leased, or operated property, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination. Under these laws and regulations, the company may be responsible for investigating, removing, or otherwise remediating hazardous substances released at properties or facilities it owns or operates, regardless of when such substances were released. As the distribution business, in general, does not involve the manufacture of products, it is typically not subject to significant liability in this area. However, there may be occasions, including through acquisitions, where environmental liability arises. Two sites for which the company assumed responsibility as part of the Wyle Electronics (“Wyle”) acquisition are known to have environmental issues, one at Norco, California and the other at Huntsville, Alabama. The company was also named as a defendant in a private lawsuit filed in connection with alleged contamination at a small industrial building formerly leased by Wyle Laboratories in El Segundo, California. That lawsuit was ultimately settled, but the possibility remains that government entities or others may attempt to involve the company in further characterization or remediation of groundwater issues in the area. The presence of environmental contamination could also interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect the company’s ability to sell or lease its properties. The discovery of contamination for which the company is responsible, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing regulations are enforced, could require the company to incur costs for compliance or subject it to unexpected liabilities. Additionally, long-term climate change impacts, including the frequency and magnitude of severe weather events, and natural disasters, may significantly impact the company’s operations and business, either directly or indirectly, by adversely affecting the price and availability of energy, and the supply of other services or materials throughout the company’s supply chain, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business.Proposed and existing efforts to address concerns over climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions could directly or indirectly affect the company’s costs of energy and other operating costs. Investors are placing a greater emphasis on environmental factors, and the company may be unable to meet investor expectations in this regard. In addition, a number of the company’s customers have adopted, or may adopt, procurement policies that may impose sustainability standards on suppliers. The perceptions held by the company’s shareholders, potential investors, suppliers, customers, other stakeholders, or the communities in which the company does business may depend, in part, on whether the company meets on a timely basis or at all the sustainability standards imposed on the company or that the company chooses or aspires to achieve. The subjective nature and wide variety of methods and processes used by various stakeholders, including investors, to assess sustainability criteria could result in a negative perception or misrepresentation of the company’s sustainability policies and practices. Also, by electing to establish and publicly share the company’s sustainability standards, the company’s business may face increased scrutiny related to sustainability activities, and the company’s reputation could be harmed. In addition, sustainability laws, regulations, requirements, and initiatives may increase compliance costs.The company may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees and could limit the company’s ability to use certain technologies in the future.Certain of the company’s products and services include intellectual property owned primarily by the company’s third party suppliers and, to a lesser extent, the company itself. Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the semiconductor/integrated circuit, software and some service industries. From time to time, third parties (including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent, copyright and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company’s business. Depending on the nature of the claim, the company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that the company is fully protected against such claims. In addition, the company is exposed to potential liability for technology that it develops itself or when it combines multiple technologies of its suppliers for which it may have limited or no indemnification protections. In any dispute involving products or services that incorporate intellectual property from multiple sources or is developed, licensed by the company, or obtained through acquisition, the company’s customers could also become the targets of litigation. The company may be obligated to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the company sells are alleged to infringe any third party’s intellectual property rights. Any infringement or indemnification claim brought against the company, regardless of the duration, outcome, or size of damage award, could:•result in substantial cost to the company;•divert management’s attention and resources;14•be time consuming to defend;•result in substantial damage awards; or•cause product shipment delays.Additionally, if an infringement claim against the company or its customers is successful, the company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase the company’s operating expenses and materially harm the company’s operating results and financial condition. Further, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all, which would then require the company to stop selling certain products or using certain technologies, which could negatively affect the company’s ability to compete effectively. Restrictions on immigration or changes in immigration laws could limit the company’s access to qualified and skilled professionals, increase the cost of doing business, or otherwise disrupt operations.Restrictions on immigration or changes in immigration laws could limit the company’s access to qualified and skilled professionals, increase the cost of doing business, or otherwise disrupt operations. The success of portions of the company’s business is dependent on its ability to recruit engineers and other professionals. Immigration laws in the United States and other countries in which the company operates are subject to legislative changes, as well as variations in the standards of application and enforcement due to political forces and economic conditions. It is difficult to predict the political and economic events that could affect immigration laws, or the restrictive impact they could have on obtaining or renewing work visas. If immigration laws change or if more restrictive government regulations are enacted, the company’s access to qualified and skilled professionals may be limited, the costs of doing business may increase, operations may be disrupted, and the company’s business may be materially negatively impacted.The company may not be able to adequately anticipate, prevent, or mitigate damage resulting from criminal and other illegal or fraudulent activities committed against it or as a result of misconduct or other improper activities by its employees or contractors.Global businesses are facing increasing risks of criminal, illegal, and other fraudulent acts.  The evolving nature of such threats, considering new and sophisticated methods used by criminals, including phishing, misrepresentation, social engineering and forgery, is making it increasingly difficult for the company to anticipate and adequately mitigate these risks. In addition, designing and implementing measures to defend against, prevent, and detect these types of activities are increasingly costly and invasive to the operations of the business.  Misconduct or failure of its employees or contractors to adhere to company policy may further heighten such risks. As a result, the company could experience a material loss to the extent that controls and other measures implemented to address these threats fail to prevent or detect such acts.In addition, misconduct by its employees or contractors may include intentional failures to comply with the applicable laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to the company. Such misconduct could result in legal or regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to the company, including to it's reputation.It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and any other precautions the company takes to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses, or in protecting the company from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against the company, and it is not successful in defending itself or asserting its rights, those actions could result in the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, which could have a significant impact on the company’s business. Whether or not the company is successful in defending against such actions or investigations, it could incur substantial costs, including legal fees, and divert the attention of management in defending itself against any of these claims or investigations.Cyber security and privacy incidents and also ransomware may hurt the company’s business, damage its reputation, increase its costs, and cause losses.The company’s information technology systems could be subject to cyber security and privacy incidents, including invasion, cyber-attacks, ransom demands, or data privacy breaches by employees and others with authorized access, and unauthorized persons. Such attacks could result in disruption to the company’s operations and/or loss or compromise of, or damage to, the company’s or any of its customers’ or suppliers’ data, confidential information, or reputation. The company’s information 15technology systems security measures may also be compromised due to employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or suppliers to disclose sensitive information in order to compromise the company’s data, assets and information technology systems. Any such incident could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to the company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, and a loss of confidence in the security of the company’s information technology systems that could potentially have an adverse impact on the company’s business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade, or sabotage the company’s information technology systems and data and information stored on those systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched, the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive or protective measures. Further, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services for the company’s operations, could be a source of risk in the event of a failure of their own systems and infrastructure or could experience their own privacy or security event which could create risks similar to those described above.The company makes investments seeking to address these risks and vulnerabilities, including ongoing monitoring, updating networks and systems, and personnel awareness training of potential cyber security and privacy threats to help ensure employees remain diligent in identifying potential risks. In addition, the company has deployed monitoring capabilities to support early detection, internal and external escalation, and effective responses to potential anomalies. As part of the company’s regular review of potential risks, the company analyzes emerging cyber security and privacy threats as well as the company’s plan and strategies to address them and presents them to senior management. Although the company has developed systems and processes that are designed to protect information and information systems and to prevent data loss and other security and privacy incidents, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security or privacy incident, such measures cannot provide absolute security. Such incidents, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in the company incurring costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, managing its brand and reputation, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, or taking other remedial steps.Also, global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. The company’s actual or perceived failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others, as well as impact to its brand and reputation, as a result of which the company may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on its business.Financial RisksThe company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources. The company requires cash or committed liquidity facilities for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital, acquisitions, and capital expenditure needs, as well as to refinance indebtedness. At December 31, 2021, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $222.2 million. In addition, the company currently has access to committed credit lines of $2.0 billion and a committed North America asset securitization program of $1.3 billion, of which the company had no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2021. The company’s ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond its control. The company may, in the future, need to access the financial markets to satisfy its cash needs. The company’s ability to obtain external financing is affected by various factors, including general financial market conditions and the company’s debt ratings. Further, any increase in the company’s level of debt or deterioration of its operating results may cause a reduction in its current debt ratings. Any downgrade in the company’s current debt rating or tightening of credit availability could impair the company’s ability to obtain additional financing or renew existing credit facilities on acceptable terms, if at all, negatively impact the price of the company’s common stock, increase its interest payments under existing debt agreements and have other negative implications on its business, many of which are beyond the company’s control. Under the terms of any additional external financing, the company may incur higher financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants. For example, the company’s existing debt agreements contain restrictive covenants, including covenants requiring compliance with specified financial ratios, and a failure to comply with these or any other covenants may result in an event of default. An increase in the company’s financing costs or loss of access to cost-effective capital resources could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business.16The agreements governing some of the company’s financing arrangements contain various covenants and restrictions that limit some of management’s discretion in operating the business and could prevent the company from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to its business.The agreements governing some of the company’s financings contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, could limit its ability to:•grant liens on assets;•make investments or certain acquisitions;•merge, consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets;•incur additional debt; or•engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the company may be limited in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, compete effectively, or make investments.Further, if an event of default under any of the company’s existing debt agreements occurred or became imminent, while the company could explore alternative sources of capital, whether debt or equity, such alternative sources may be more expensive than the costs it incurred under the company's existing credit facility. Further, the company may be unable to borrow additional amounts under the existing credit facility, and as a result may be unable to make acquisitions or fund share repurchases, and the lenders thereunder may be able to accelerate the company’s obligations under the debt agreement. This circumstance would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations.The company’s goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of its assets and reduce its net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the assets acquired. The company also ascribes value to certain identifiable intangible assets, which consist primarily of customer relationships and trade names, among others, as a result of acquisitions. The company may incur impairment charges on goodwill or identifiable intangible assets if it determines that the fair values of the goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are less than their current carrying values. The company evaluates, on a regular basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary. Refer to Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion of the impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. A decline in general economic conditions, a substantial increase in market interest rates, and increase in income tax rates, or the company’s inability to meet long-term working capital or operating income projections could impact future valuations of the company’s reporting units, and the company could be required to record an impairment charge in the future, which could impact the company’s consolidated balance sheets, as well as the company’s consolidated statements of operations. If the company were required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the company’s consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, North America asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings.General RisksThe company’s success depends upon its ability to attract, retain, motivate and develop key executive and employee talent and the strategies they develop and implement.Any failure to attract, retain, motivate and develop key executive and employee talent may materially and adversely affect the company’s business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. The company’s success depends, to a significant extent, on the capability, expertise, and continued services of its key executives. The company relies on the expertise and experience of certain key executives in developing business strategies, business operations, and maintaining relationships with customers and suppliers. If the company were to lose any of its key executives, it may not be able to find a suitable replacement with comparable knowledge and experience in a timely manner, or if at all, at similar level of remuneration and other benefits. 17If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discovers material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.An effective internal control environment is necessary for the company to produce reliable financial reports, safeguard assets, and is an important part of its effort to prevent financial fraud. The company is required to annually evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal controls over financial reporting. Based on these evaluations, the company may conclude that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable. While management evaluates the effectiveness of the company’s internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment. In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate financial statement risk. If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or the company’s independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls, it may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business. In addition, the company may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or the NYSE. Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the company’s consolidated financial statements, which could cause the market price of its common stock to decline or limit the company’s access to capital.General business conditions are vulnerable to the effects of epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which could materially disrupt the company’s business and have a negative impact on the company’s financial results and financial condition.The company is vulnerable to the general economic effects of epidemics, pandemics and other public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The global COVID-19 pandemic continues to create significant macroeconomic uncertainty, volatility and disruption, including supply constraints, extended lead times, and unpredictability across many markets. Supply chain constraints are being caused by shortages in electronics components markets and supply chain logistical issues resulting in extended lead times and unpredictability. Also, there has been a substantial curtailment of travel and business activities due to COVID-19, which has caused and may continue to cause significant disruptions to the U.S. and global economy. The extent to which COVID-19 and ensuing challenges such as supply chain constraints will continue to impact the company’s results will depend primarily on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the severity and duration of the crisis, the speed and effectiveness of vaccine and treatment developments and deployment, the impact of vaccine and other mandates, potential mutations of COVID-19, and the impact of actions taken and that will be taken to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. For example, COVID-19 or other epidemics or pandemics may result in the company having to limit operations, rely on personnel working from home, or implement additional restrictions as a result of widespread government restrictions, any of which may negatively impact productivity or disrupt, delay or otherwise adversely impact the company's business. Remote working could increase the company’s cyber security risk. In addition, a U.S. or global recession or a banking crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business, financial results and financial condition, including by reducing the demand for its products and services, reducing the access to its supplies, increasing customer defaults, reducing its access to capital, and reducing the value of its common stock"
0,ARW,ARROW ELECTRONICS INC,2021-02-11,"Risk Factors
Described below and throughout this report are certain risks that the company’s management believes are applicable to the company’s business and the industries in which it operates. If any of the described events occur, the company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected. When stated below that a risk may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business, it means that such risk may have one or more of these effects. There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known. There are also risks within the economy, the industry, and the capital markets that could materially adversely affect the company, including those associated with an economic recession, inflation, a global economic slowdown, political instability, government regulation (including tax regulation), employee attraction and retention, and customers’ inability or refusal to pay for the products and services provided by the company. There are also risks associated with the occurrence of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks or natural disasters (such as tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods). These factors affect businesses generally, including the company, its customers and suppliers and, as a result, are not discussed in detail below, but are applicable to the company. Operational RisksIf the company is unable to maintain its relationships with its suppliers or if the suppliers materially change the terms of their existing agreements with the company, the company’s business could be materially adversely affected. A substantial portion of the company’s inventory is purchased from suppliers with which the company has entered into non-exclusive distribution agreements. These agreements are typically cancellable on short notice (generally 30 to 90 days). Some of the company’s businesses rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide a high percentage of their revenues. For example, sales of products from one of the company’s suppliers accounted for approximately 14% of the company’s consolidated sales. To the extent that the company’s significant suppliers reduce the number of products they sell through distribution, cease to continue doing business with the company, or are unable to continue to meet or significantly alter their obligations, the company’s business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, to the extent that the company’s suppliers modify the terms of their contracts to the detriment of the company, limit supplies due to capacity constraints, or other factors, there could be a material adverse effect on the company’s business. Further, the supplier landscape has continued to experience a consolidation, which could negatively impact the company if the surviving, consolidated suppliers decide to exclude the company from their supply chain efforts, and which could expose the company to increased risks, including increased pricing and dependence on a smaller number of suppliers. Increasing consolidation in the industries where the company’s suppliers operate may occur as companies combine to achieve further economies of scale and other synergies, which could result in reduced supplies, as companies seek to eliminate duplicative product lines, and increased prices, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business. The competitive pressures the company faces, such as pricing and margin reductions, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business.The company operates in a highly competitive international environment. The company competes with other large multinational and national electronic components and enterprise computing solutions distributors, as well as numerous other smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on narrower market sectors, products, or industries. The company also competes for customers with its suppliers. The size of the company’s competitors varies across market sectors, as do the resources the company has allocated to the sectors in which it does business. Therefore, some of the company’s competitors may have a more extensive customer and/or supplier base than the company in one or more of its market sectors. There is significant competition within each market sector and geography that creates pricing and margin pressure and the need for constant attention to improve service and product offerings and increase market share. Other competitive factors include rapid technological changes, product availability, credit availability, speed of delivery, ability to tailor solutions to changing customer needs, and quality and depth of product lines and training, as well as service and support provided by the distributor to the customer. The company also faces competition from companies in the logistics and product fulfillment, catalog distribution, and e-commerce supply chain services markets. As the company continues to expand its business into new areas in order to stay competitive in the market, the company may encounter increased competition from its current and/or new competitors, making it difficult to retain its market share. Further, the enterprise computing distributors industry has recently experienced increased consolidation, resulting in companies with greater scale, market presence and purchasing power than before. As a result, competition among enterprise computing distributors has increased. In addition, there is no guarantee that the company’s response to and growth in emerging technologies will be successful. The company’s failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could have a material adverse effect on its business.9Declines in value of the company’s inventory could materially adversely affect its business. The market for the company’s products and services is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in end-market demand, evolving customer expectations, oversupply of product, and regulatory requirements, which can contribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of inventory. Although many of the company’s suppliers provide the company with certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and certain rights of return), the company cannot be sure that such protections will fully compensate it for the loss in value, or that the suppliers will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements. For example, many of the company’s suppliers will not allow products to be returned after they have been held in inventory beyond a certain amount of time, and, in most instances, the return rights are limited to a certain percentage of the amount of products the company purchased in a particular time frame. Therefore, the company is not fully protected from declines in the value of the company’s inventory, and such decline could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business.The company’s lack of long-term sales contracts may have a material adverse effect on its business.Most of the company’s sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts. The company generally works with its customers to develop non-binding forecasts for future orders. Based on such non-binding forecasts, the company makes commitments regarding the level of business that it will seek and accept, the inventory that it purchases, and the levels of utilization of personnel and other resources. A variety of conditions, both specific to each customer and generally affecting each customer’s industry may cause customers to cancel, reduce, or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated, file for bankruptcy protection, or default on their payments. Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays in orders by customers, loss of customers, and/or customer defaults on payments could materially adversely affect the company’s business.The company’s revenues originate primarily from the sales of semiconductor, PEMCO (passive, electro-mechanical and connector), and IT hardware and software products, the sales of which are traditionally cyclical. The semiconductor industry historically has experienced fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity and subject to significant economic market upturns and downturns. Sales of semiconductor products and related services represented approximately 54%, 49%, and 45%, of the company’s consolidated sales in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The sale of the company’s PEMCO products closely tracks the semiconductor market. Accordingly, the company’s revenues and profitability, particularly in its global components business segment, tend to closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market. Further, economic weakness could cause a decline in spending in information technology, which could have a negative impact on the company’s ECS business. A cyclical downturn in the technology industry could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and negatively impact its ability to maintain historical profitability levels.The company’s non-U.S. sales represent a significant portion of its revenues, and consequently, the company is exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.In 2020, 2019, and 2018, approximately 65%, 60%, and 59%, respectively, of the company’s sales came from its operations outside the United States. As a result of the company’s international sales and locations, its operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following: •import and export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;•the burden and cost of compliance with international laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations; •potential restrictions on transfers of funds;•import and export tariffs, duties and value-added taxes;•transportation delays and interruptions;•the burden and cost of compliance with complex multi-national tax laws and regulations;•uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations; •foreign laws that potentially discriminate against companies which are headquartered outside that jurisdiction;•stringent antitrust regulations in local jurisdictions;•volatility associated with sovereign debt of certain international economies;10•the uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effects of Brexit; •potential military conflicts and political risks; and•currency fluctuations, which the company attempts to minimize through traditional hedging instruments.Also, the company’s gross margins in the components business in the Asia-Pacific region tend to be lower than those in other markets in which the company sells products and services. If sales in this market increases as a percentage of overall sales, consolidated gross margins will be lower. While the company has and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business abroad, it cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate and, therefore, such risks could have a material adverse effect on its business.Moreover, the company’s effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by, among other things, changes in the mix of earnings among countries having different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets, and certain international tax policy efforts, including the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, the European Commission’s state aid investigations, and other initiatives adversely affecting taxation of international businesses. Furthermore, many of the countries where the company is subject to taxes are independently evaluating their tax policy and some have already passed tax legislation which affect international businesses.  For instance, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted tax legislation (“Tax Act”), which significantly changed the tax laws by favorably reducing the corporate federal tax rate (35% to 21%) and moving to a territorial system, while simultaneously imposing an unfavorable one-time tax on accumulated foreign earnings, limiting deductibility of certain import related costs, including interest expense, and creating a new tax on certain international activities. Additionally, tax returns are subject to periodic audits by U.S. and foreign tax authorities, and these audits may result in allocations of income and/or deductions that may result in tax assessments different from amounts that have been estimated. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these audits to determine the adequacy of the company’s provision for taxes. Such tax changes, to the extent they are brought against the company, could increase the effective tax rates in many of the countries where the company has operations and ultimately could have an adverse effect on overall tax liability, along with increasing the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance, all of which could impact the company’s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.When the company makes acquisitions, it may take on additional liabilities or not be able to successfully integrate such acquisitions.As part of the company’s history and growth strategy, it has acquired other businesses. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:•effectively combining the acquired operations, technologies, or products;•unanticipated costs or assumed liabilities, including those associated with regulatory actions or investigations;•not realizing the anticipated financial benefit from the acquired companies;•diversion of management’s attention;•negative effects on existing customer and supplier relationships; and•potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies.Further, the company has made, and may continue to make acquisitions of, or investments in new services, businesses or technologies to expand its current service offerings and product lines. Some of these may involve risks that may differ from those traditionally associated with the company’s core distribution business, including undertaking product or service warranty responsibilities that in its traditional core business would generally reside primarily with its suppliers. If the company is not successful in mitigating or insuring against such risks, it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business.If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discovers material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.An effective internal control environment is necessary for the company to produce reliable financial reports, safeguard assets, and is an important part of its effort to prevent financial fraud. The company is required to annually evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal controls over financial reporting. Based on these evaluations, the company may conclude that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable. While management evaluates the effectiveness of the company’s internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. 11There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment. In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate financial statement risk. If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or the company’s independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls, it may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business. In addition, the company may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or the NYSE. Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the company’s financial statements, which could cause the market price of its common stock to decline or limit the company’s access to capital.The company relies heavily on its internal information systems, which, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect the company’s business.The company’s current global operations reside on multiple technology platforms.  The size and complexity of the company’s computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, and random attack. The company relies on a global enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system to standardize its global components processes worldwide and adopt best-in-class capabilities. The company committed significant resources to this new ERP system, which replaced multiple legacy systems of the company. Such conversion was extremely complex, in part, because of the wide range of processes and the multiple legacy systems that must be integrated globally.  Failure to properly or adequately address any unaccounted for or unforeseen issues could impact the company’s ability to perform necessary business operations, which could materially adversely affect the company’s business.Regulatory and Legal RisksProducts sold by the company may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against the company, which may have a material adverse effect on the company. The company sells its components at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. As a result, the company may face claims for damages (such as consequential damages) that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits it receives from the components involved in the claims. While the company typically has provisions in its supplier agreements that hold the supplier accountable for defective products, and the company and its suppliers generally exclude consequential damages in their standard terms and conditions, the company’s ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited as a result of differing factors, such as the inability to exclude such damages due to the laws of some of the countries where the company does business. The company’s business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in the products sold by the company, if it is required to pay for the associated damages. Although the company currently has product liability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage and amount and may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims. Further, when relying on contractual liability exclusions, the company could lose customers if their claims are not addressed to their satisfaction. Tariffs may result in increased prices and could adversely affect the company’s business and results of operations.In recent years, the U.S. government imposed tariffs on certain products imported into the United States and the Chinese government imposed tariffs on certain products imported into China, which have increased the prices of many of the products that the company purchases from its suppliers. The tariffs, along with any additional tariffs or trade restrictions that may be implemented by the U.S., China or other countries, could result in further increased prices. While the company intends to pass price increases on to its customers, the effect of tariffs on prices may impact sales and results of operations. Retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods have not yet had a significant impact, but the company cannot predict further developments. The tariffs and the additional operational costs incurred in minimizing the number of products subject to the tariffs could adversely affect the operating profits for certain of the company’s businesses and customer demand for certain products which could have an adverse effect on its business and results of operations.In addition, in the event that the company pays tariffs for products it imports from China which are then re-exported to other locations outside of the United States, the company may be eligible for refunds of certain tariffs. In order to qualify for these tariff drawbacks, the company must provide data and documentation to the U.S. government that it must obtain from third-party sources, such as its suppliers. There is no guarantee the company will be able to obtain this additional data and documentation from those other sources, which could result in the U.S. government rejecting the drawback requests. Further, there are additional administrative costs expended by the company in furtherance of these efforts. Finally, due to the backlog of drawback applications, the U.S. government has been slow in issuing the associated drawback refunds. The company’s inability 12to obtain the drawback refunds or significant delays in receiving them could result in a material adverse effect on the company’s business.The company is subject to U.S. and certain foreign export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti-corruption laws, anti-bribery laws, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. In the event of non-compliance, the company can face serious consequences, which can harm its business. The company is subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), U.S. Customs regulations, various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls (“OFAC”). Products the company sells which are either manufactured in the United States or based on U.S. technology (“U.S. Products”) are subject to the EAR when exported and re-exported to and from all international jurisdictions, in addition to the local jurisdiction’s export regulations applicable to individual shipments. Licenses or proper license exemptions may be required by local jurisdictions’ export regulations, including EAR, for the shipment of certain U.S. Products to certain countries, including China, India, Russia, and other countries in which the company operates. Non-compliance with the EAR, OFAC regulations, or other applicable export regulations can result in a wide range of penalties including the denial of export privileges, fines, criminal penalties, and the seizure of inventories. In the event that any export regulatory body determines that any shipments made by the company violate the applicable export regulations, the company could be fined significant sums and/or its export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business. For example, in 2019, the company determined that from 2015 to 2019 a limited number of non-executive employees, without first obtaining required authorization from the company or the United States government, had facilitated product shipments with an aggregate total invoiced value of approximately $4.8 million, to resellers for reexports to persons covered by the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 or other United States sanctions and export control laws. The company has voluntarily reported these activities to OFAC and the United States Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”), conducted an internal investigation and terminated or disciplined the employees involved. BIS has closed its investigation and issued the company a warning letter without referring the matter for further proceedings. No penalties have been imposed by BIS. The company has cooperated fully and intends to continue to cooperate fully with OFAC with respect to its review, which may result in the imposition of penalties, which we are currently not able to estimate.Further, the company is also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. §201, and other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which it conducts business. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors, and other collaborators from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to recipients in the public or private sector. The company engages third parties to provide services. The company can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of its employees, agents, and contractors, even if it does not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. Any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences.The company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could materially adversely affect its business. A number of jurisdictions in which the company’s products are sold have enacted laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other related matters. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of the company’s products and impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters. Failure to comply with these laws or any other applicable environmental regulations could result in fines or suspension of sales. Additionally, these directives and regulations may result in the company having non-compliant inventory that may be less readily salable or have to be written off. Some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from the company’s currently or formerly owned, leased, or operated property, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination. As the distribution business, in general, does not involve the manufacture of products, it is typically not subject to significant liability in this area. However, there may be occasions, including through acquisitions, where environmental liability arises. Two sites for which the company assumed responsibility as part of the Wyle Electronics (“Wyle”) acquisition are known to have environmental issues, one at Norco, California and the other at Huntsville, Alabama. The company was also named as a defendant in a private lawsuit filed in connection with alleged contamination at a small industrial building formerly leased by Wyle Laboratories in El Segundo, California. That lawsuit was ultimately settled, but the possibility remains that government entities or others may attempt to 13involve the company in further characterization or remediation of groundwater issues in the area. The presence of environmental contamination could also interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect the company’s ability to sell or lease its properties. The discovery of contamination for which the company is responsible, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing regulations are enforced, could require the company to incur costs for compliance or subject it to unexpected liabilities. The company may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees and could limit the company’s ability to use certain technologies in the future.Certain of the company’s products and services include intellectual property owned primarily by the company’s third party suppliers and, to a lesser extent, the company itself. Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the semiconductor/integrated circuit, software and some service industries. From time to time, third parties (including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent, copyright and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company’s business. Depending on the nature of the claim, the company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that the company is fully protected against such claims. In addition, the company is exposed to potential liability for technology that it develops itself or when it combines multiple technologies of its suppliers for which it may have limited or no indemnification protections. In any dispute involving products or services that incorporate intellectual property from multiple sources or is developed, licensed by the company, or obtained through acquisition, the company’s customers could also become the targets of litigation. The company may be obligated to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the company sells are alleged to infringe any third party’s intellectual property rights. Any infringement or indemnification claim brought against the company, regardless of the duration, outcome, or size of damage award, could:•result in substantial cost to the company;•divert management’s attention and resources;•be time consuming to defend;•result in substantial damage awards; or•cause product shipment delays.Additionally, if an infringement claim against the company or its customers is successful, the company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase the company’s operating expenses and materially harm the company’s operating results and financial condition. Further, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all, which would then require the company to stop selling certain products or using certain technologies, which could negatively affect the company’s ability to compete effectively. Restrictions on immigration or changes in immigration laws could limit the company’s access to qualified and skilled professionals, increase the cost of doing business, or otherwise disrupt operations.Restrictions on immigration or changes in immigration laws could limit the company’s access to qualified and skilled professionals, increase the cost of doing business, or otherwise disrupt operations. The success of portions of the company’s business is dependent on its ability to recruit engineers and other professionals. Immigration laws in the United States and other countries in which the company operates are subject to legislative changes, as well as variations in the standards of application and enforcement due to political forces and economic conditions. It is difficult to predict the political and economic events that could affect immigration laws, or the restrictive impact they could have on obtaining or renewing work visas. If immigration laws change or if more restrictive government regulations are enacted, the company’s access to qualified and skilled professionals may be limited, the costs of doing business may increase, operations may be disrupted, and the company’s business may be materially negatively impacted.The company may not be able to adequately anticipate, prevent, or mitigate damage resulting from criminal and other illegal or fraudulent activities committed against it or as a result of misconduct or other improper activities by its employees or contractors.Global businesses are facing increasing risks of criminal, illegal, and other fraudulent acts.  The evolving nature of such threats, considering new and sophisticated methods used by criminals, including phishing, misrepresentation, social engineering and 14forgery, is making it increasingly difficult for the company to anticipate and adequately mitigate these risks. In addition, designing and implementing measures to defend against, prevent, and detect these types of activities are increasingly costly and invasive into the operations of the business.  In addition, misconduct or failure of its employees or contractors to adhere to company policy may further heighten such risks. As a result, the company could experience a material loss to the extent that controls and other measures implemented to address these threats fail to prevent or detect such acts.In addition, misconduct by its employees or contracts may include intentional failures to comply with the applicable laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to the company. Such misconduct could result in legal or regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to the company’s reputation.It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and any other precautions the company takes to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses, or in protecting the company from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against the company, and it is not successful in defending itself or asserting its rights, those actions could result in the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, which could have a significant impact on the company’s business. Whether or not the company is successful in defending against such actions or investigations, it could incur substantial costs, including legal fees, and divert the attention of management in defending itself against any of these claims or investigations.Cyber security and privacy breaches may hurt the company’s business, damage its reputation, increase its costs, and cause losses.The company’s information technology systems could be subject to invasion, cyber-attack, or data privacy breaches by employees, others with authorized access, and unauthorized persons. Such attacks could result in disruption to the company’s operations and/or loss or disclosure of, or damage to, the company’s or any of its customer’s or supplier’s data, confidential information, or reputation. The company’s information technology systems security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or suppliers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the company’s data and information technology systems. Any such breach could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to the company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, and a loss of confidence in the security of the company’s information technology systems that could potentially have an impact on the company’s business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade, or sabotage the company’s information technology systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched, the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Further, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services for the company’s operations, could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure.The company makes investments seeking to address risks and vulnerabilities, including ongoing monitoring, updating networks and systems, and personnel awareness training of potential cyber security threats to help ensure employees remain diligent in identifying potential risks. In addition, the company has deployed monitoring capabilities to support early detection, internal and external escalation, and effective responses to potential anomalies. As part of the company’s regular review of potential risks, the company analyzes emerging cyber security threats as well as the company’s plan and strategies to address them and presents them to senior management. Although the company has developed systems and processes that are designed to protect information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach, such measures cannot provide absolute security. Such breaches, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in the company incurring costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, or taking other remedial steps.Also, global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. The company’s failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others. Although the company has insurance coverage for protecting against loss from cyber security and privacy risks, it may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and the company may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on its business.15Financial RisksThe company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources. The company requires cash or committed liquidity facilities for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital, acquisitions, and capital expenditure needs, as well as to refinance indebtedness. At December 31, 2020, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $373.6 million. In addition, the company currently has access to committed credit lines of $2.0 billion and a committed North America asset securitization program of $1.2 billion, of which the company had no outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2020. The company’s ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond its control. The company may, in the future, need to access the financial markets to satisfy its cash needs. The company’s ability to obtain external financing is affected by various factors, including general financial market conditions and the company’s debt ratings. Further, any increase in the company’s level of debt or deterioration of its operating results may cause a reduction in its current debt ratings. Any downgrade in the company’s current debt rating or tightening of credit availability could impair the company’s ability to obtain additional financing or renew existing credit facilities on acceptable terms, if at all, negatively impact the price of the company’s common stock, increase its interest payments under existing debt agreements and have other negative implications on its business, many of which are beyond the company’s control. Under the terms of any additional external financing, the company may incur higher financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants. For example, the company’s existing debt agreements contain restrictive covenants, including covenants requiring compliance with specified financial ratios, and a failure to comply with these or any other covenants may result in an event of default. An increase in the company’s financing costs or loss of access to cost-effective capital resources could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business.The agreements governing some of the company’s financing arrangements contain various covenants and restrictions that limit some of management’s discretion in operating the business and could prevent the company from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to its business.The agreements governing the company’s financings contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, could limit its ability to:•grant liens on assets;•make investments or certain acquisitions;•merge, consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets;•incur additional debt; or•engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the company may be limited in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, compete effectively, or make investments.Further, if an event of default under any of the company’s existing debt agreements occurred or became imminent, while it could explore alternative sources of capital, whether debt or equity, such alternative sources would likely be more expensive than the costs it incurs under its existing credit facility. Further, it would be unable to borrow additional amounts under the existing credit facility, and as a result would be unable to make acquisitions or fund share repurchases, and the lenders thereunder could accelerate the company’s obligations under the debt agreement. This circumstance would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations.The company’s goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of its assets and reduce its net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the assets acquired. The company also ascribes value to certain identifiable intangible assets, which consist primarily of customer relationships and trade names, among others, as a result of acquisitions. The company may incur impairment charges on goodwill or identifiable intangible assets if it determines that the fair values of the goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are less than their current carrying values. The company evaluates, on a regular basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, 16of the carrying amount of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary. For example, during the second quarter of 2019, based in part on the company’s downward revision of forecasted future earnings and the decision to wind down its personal computer and mobility asset disposition business, the company conducted an interim goodwill impairment analysis related to the Americas components and Asia-Pacific components reporting units. As a result of the impairment analysis, the company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $570.2 million. Additionally, the company recorded a non-cash trade name impairment charge of $46.0 million in connection with an initiative to further integrate two global components businesses.Refer to Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion of the impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. A decline in general economic conditions, a substantial increase in market interest rates, and increase in income tax rates, or the company’s inability to meet long-term working capital or operating income projections could impact future valuations of the company’s reporting units, and the company could be required to record an impairment charge in the future, which could impact the company’s consolidated balance sheets, as well as the company’s consolidated statements of operations. If the company were required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the company’s consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, North America asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings.General RisksThe company’s success depends upon its ability to attract, retain, motivate and develop key executives and the strategies they develop.Any failure to attract, retain, motivate and develop key talent may materially and adversely affect the company’s business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. The company’s success depends, to a significant extent, on the capability, expertise, and continued services of its key executives. The company relies on the expertise and experience of certain key executives in developing business strategies, business operations, and maintaining relationships with customers and suppliers. If the company were to lose any of its key executives, it may not be able to find a suitable replacement with comparable knowledge and experience in a timely manner, or if at all, at similar level of remuneration and other benefits. General business conditions are vulnerable to the effects of epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which could materially disrupt the company’s business and have a negative impact on the company’s financial results and financial condition.The company is vulnerable to the general economic effects of epidemics, pandemics and other public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a substantial curtailment of travel and business activities, which is causing significant disruptions to the U.S. and global economy. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts the company’s results will depend primarily on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the severity and duration of the crisis, the speed and effectiveness of vaccine and treatment developments and deployment, potential mutations of COVID-19, and the impact of actions taken and that will be taken to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others.  For example, if COVID-19 continues to spread, the company may need to limit operations or implement additional restrictions as a result of widespread government restrictions. The company’s increased reliance on personnel working from home may negatively impact productivity or disrupt, delay or otherwise adversely impact its business. In addition, remote working could increase the company’s cyber security risk. In addition, a U.S. or global recession or a banking crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business, financial results and financial condition, including by reducing the demand for its products and services, reducing the access to its supplies, increasing customer defaults, reducing its access to capital, and reducing the value of its common stock.To date, the company has experienced limitations in employee resources resulting from travel restrictions and “stay at home” orders.17"
4,ARW,ARROW ELECTRONICS INC,2020-02-13,"Risk Factors
Described below and throughout this report are certain risks that the company's management believes are applicable to the company's business and the industries in which it operates. If any of the described events occur, the company's business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected. When stated below that a risk may have a material adverse effect on the company's business, it means that such risk may have one or more of these effects. There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known. There are also risks within the economy, the industry, and the capital markets that could materially adversely affect the company, including those associated with an economic recession, inflation, a global economic slowdown, political instability, government regulation (including tax regulation), employee attraction and retention, and customers' inability or refusal to pay for the products and services provided by the company. There are also risks associated with the occurrence of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks or natural disasters (such as tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods). These factors affect businesses generally, including the company, its customers and suppliers and, as a result, are not discussed in detail below, but are applicable to the company.  If the company is unable to maintain its relationships with its suppliers or if the suppliers materially change the terms of their existing agreements with the company, the company's business could be materially adversely affected. A substantial portion of the company's inventory is purchased from suppliers with which the company has entered into non-exclusive distribution agreements. These agreements are typically cancelable on short notice (generally 30 to 90 days). Some of the company's businesses rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide a high percentage of their revenues. For example, sales of products from one of the company's suppliers accounted for approximately 9% of the company's consolidated sales. To the extent that the company's significant suppliers reduce the number of products they sell through distribution, are unwilling to continue to do business with the company, or are unable to continue to meet or significantly alter their obligations, the company's business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, to the extent that the company's suppliers modify the terms of their contracts to the detriment of the company, limit supplies due to capacity constraints, or other factors, there could be a material adverse effect on the company's business. Further, the supplier landscape has experienced a consolidation, which could negatively impact the company if the surviving, consolidated suppliers decide to exclude the company from their supply chain efforts.The competitive pressures the company faces, such as pricing and margin reductions, could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.The company operates in a highly competitive international environment. The company competes with other large multinational and national electronic components and enterprise computing solutions distributors, as well as numerous other smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on narrower market sectors, products, or industries. The company also competes for customers with its suppliers. The size of the company's competitors varies across market sectors, as do the resources the company has allocated to the sectors in which it does business. Therefore, some of the company's competitors may have a more extensive customer and/or supplier base than the company in one or more of its market sectors. There is significant competition within each market sector and geography that creates pricing and margin pressure and the need for constant attention to improve service and product offerings and increase market share. Other competitive factors include rapid technological changes, product availability, credit availability, speed of delivery, ability to tailor solutions to changing customer needs, and quality and depth of product lines and training, as well as service and support provided by the distributor to the customer. The company also faces competition from companies in the logistics and product fulfillment, catalog distribution, and e-commerce supply chain services markets. As the company continues to expand its business into new areas in order to stay competitive in the market, the company may encounter increased competition from its current and/or new competitors, making it difficult to retain its market share. Further, there is no guarantee that the company's response to and growth in emerging technologies will be successful. The company's failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could have a material adverse effect on its business.The company may not be able to adequately anticipate, prevent, or mitigate damage resulting from criminal and other illegal or fraudulent activities committed against it.Global businesses are facing increasing risks of criminal, illegal, and other fraudulent acts.  The evolving nature of such threats, considering new and sophisticated methods used by criminals, including phishing, misrepresentation, social engineering and forgery, is making it increasingly difficult for the company to anticipate and adequately mitigate these risks. In addition, designing and implementing measures to defend against, prevent, and detect these types of activities are increasingly costly and invasive into the operations of the business.  As a result, the company could experience a material loss in the future to the extent that controls and other measures implemented to address these threats fail to prevent or detect such acts.7Products sold by the company may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against the company, which may have a material adverse effect on the company.  The company sells its components at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. As a result, the company may face claims for damages (such as consequential damages) that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits it receives from the components involved in the claims. While the company typically has provisions in its supplier agreements that hold the supplier accountable for defective products, and the company and its suppliers generally exclude consequential damages in their standard terms and conditions, the company's ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited as a result of differing factors, such as the inability to exclude such damages due to the laws of some of the countries where the company does business. The company's business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in the products sold by the company, if it is required to pay for the associated damages. Although the company currently has product liability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage and amount. Further, when relying on contractual liability exclusions, the company could lose customers if their claims are not addressed to their satisfaction.  Declines in value of the company's inventory could materially adversely affect its business. The market for the company's products and services is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in end-market demand, evolving customer expectations, oversupply of product, and regulatory requirements, which can contribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of inventory. Although many of the company's suppliers provide the company with certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and certain rights of return), the company cannot be sure that such protections will fully compensate it for the loss in value, or that the suppliers will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements. For example, many of the company's suppliers will not allow products to be returned after they have been held in inventory beyond a certain amount of time, and, in most instances, the return rights are limited to a certain percentage of the amount of product the company purchased in a particular time frame. These factors could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.Tariffs may result in increased prices and could adversely affect the company's business and results of operations.Recently, the U.S. government imposed tariffs on certain products imported into the U.S. and the Chinese government imposed tariffs on certain products imported into China, which have increased the prices of many of the products that the company purchases from its suppliers. The tariffs, along with any additional tariffs or trade restrictions that may be implemented by the U.S., China or other countries, could result in further increased prices. While the company intends to pass price increases on to its customers, the effect of tariffs on prices may impact sales and results of operations. Retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods have not yet had a significant impact, but the company cannot predict further developments. The tariffs and the additional operational costs incurred in minimizing the number of products subject to the tariffs could adversely affect the operating profits for certain of the company's businesses and customer demand for certain products which could have an adverse effect on its business and results of operations.In addition, in the event that the company pays tariffs for products it imports from China which are then re-exported to other locations outside of the United States, the company may be eligible for refunds of certain tariffs. In order to qualify for these tariff drawbacks, the company must provide data and documentation to the U.S. government that it must obtain from third-party sources, such as its suppliers. There is no guarantee the company will be able to obtain this additional data and documentation from those other sources, which could result in the U.S. government rejecting the drawback requests. Further, there are additional administrative costs expended by the company in furtherance of these efforts. Finally, due to the backlog of drawback applications, the U.S. government has been slow in issuing the associated drawback refunds. The company’s inability to obtain the drawback refunds or significant delays in receiving them could result in a material adverse effect on the company’s business.The company is subject to U.S. and certain foreign export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. In the event of non-compliance, the company can face serious consequences, which can harm its business. The company is subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), U.S. Customs regulations, various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Controls (“OFAC”). Products the company sells which are either manufactured in the United States or based on U.S. technology (""U.S. Products"") are subject to the EAR when exported and re-exported to and from all international jurisdictions, in addition to the local jurisdiction's export regulations applicable to individual shipments. Licenses or proper license exemptions may be required by local jurisdictions' export regulations, including EAR, for the shipment of certain U.S. Products to certain countries, including China, India, Russia, and other countries in which the company operates. Non-compliance with the EAR, OFAC regulations, or other applicable export regulations can result in a wide range of penalties including 8the denial of export privileges, fines, criminal penalties, and the seizure of inventories. In the event that any export regulatory body determines that any shipments made by the company violate the applicable export regulations, the company could be fined significant sums and/or its export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. For example, in 2019, the company determined that from 2015 to 2019 a limited number of non-executive employees, without first obtaining required authorization from the company or the United States government, had facilitated product shipments with an aggregate total invoiced value of approximately $4.8 million, to resellers for reexports to persons covered by the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 or other United States sanctions and export control laws. The company voluntarily reported these activities to OFAC and the United States Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”), conducted an internal investigation and terminated or disciplined the employees involved. The company has cooperated fully and intends to continue to cooperate fully with OFAC and BIS with respect to their review, which may result in the imposition of penalties, which the company is currently not able to estimate.Further, the company is also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. § 201, and other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which it conducts business. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors, and other collaborators from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to recipients in the public or private sector. The company engages third parties to provide services. The company can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of its employees, agents, and contractors, even if it does not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. Any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences.The company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could materially adversely affect its business. A number of jurisdictions in which the company's products are sold have enacted laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other related matters. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of the company's products and impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters. Failure to comply with these laws or any other applicable environmental regulations could result in fines or suspension of sales. Additionally, these directives and regulations may result in the company having non-compliant inventory that may be less readily salable or have to be written off. Some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from the company's currently or formerly owned, leased, or operated property, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination. As the distribution business, in general, does not involve the manufacture of products, it is typically not subject to significant liability in this area. However, there may be occasions, including through acquisitions, where environmental liability arises. Two sites for which the company assumed responsibility as part of the Wyle Electronics (""Wyle"") acquisition are known to have environmental issues, one at Norco, California and the other at Huntsville, Alabama. The company was also named as a defendant in a private lawsuit filed in connection with alleged contamination at a small industrial building formerly leased by Wyle Laboratories in El Segundo, California. That lawsuit was ultimately settled, but the possibility remains that government entities or others may attempt to involve the company in further characterization or remediation of groundwater issues in the area. The presence of environmental contamination could also interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect the company's ability to sell or lease its properties. The discovery of contamination for which the company is responsible, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing regulations are enforced, could require the company to incur costs for compliance or subject it to unexpected liabilities. The company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources. The company requires cash or committed liquidity facilities for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital, acquisitions, and capital expenditure needs, as well as to refinance indebtedness. At December 31, 2019, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $300.1 million. In addition, the company currently has access to committed credit lines of $2.0 billion and a committed North America asset securitization program of $1.2 billion, of which the company had outstanding borrowings of $410.0 million at December 31, 2019. The company's ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond its control. The company may, in the future, need to access the financial markets to satisfy its cash needs. The company's ability to obtain external financing is affected by various factors, including general financial market conditions and the company's debt ratings. Further, any increase in the company's level of debt or deterioration of its operating results may cause a reduction in its current 9debt ratings. Any downgrade in the company's current debt rating or tightening of credit availability could impair the company's ability to obtain additional financing or renew existing credit facilities on acceptable terms. Under the terms of any external financing, the company may incur higher financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants. For example, the company's existing debt agreements contain restrictive covenants, including covenants requiring compliance with specified financial ratios, and a failure to comply with these or any other covenants may result in an event of default. An increase in the company's financing costs or loss of access to cost-effective capital resources could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.The agreements governing some of the company's financing arrangements contain various covenants and restrictions that limit some of management's discretion in operating the business and could prevent the company from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to its business.The agreements governing the company's financings contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, could limit its ability to:•grant liens on assets;•make investments;•merge, consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets;•incur additional debt; or•engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the company may be limited in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, compete effectively, or make investments.The company's lack of long-term sales contracts may have a material adverse effect on its business.Most of the company's sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts. The company generally works with its customers to develop non-binding forecasts for future orders. Based on such non-binding forecasts, the company makes commitments regarding the level of business that it will seek and accept, the inventory that it purchases, and the levels of utilization of personnel and other resources. A variety of conditions, both specific to each customer and generally affecting each customer's industry may cause customers to cancel, reduce, or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated, file for bankruptcy protection, or default on their payments. Generally, customers cancel, reduce, or delay purchase orders and commitments without penalty. The company seeks to mitigate these risks, in some cases, by entering into noncancelable/nonreturnable sales agreements, but there is no guarantee that such agreements will adequately protect the company. Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays in orders by customers, loss of customers, and/or customer defaults on payments could materially adversely affect the company's business.The company's revenues originate primarily from the sales of semiconductor, PEMCO (passive, electro-mechanical and connector), and IT hardware and software products, the sales of which are traditionally cyclical. The semiconductor industry historically has experienced fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity and subject to significant economic market upturns and downturns. Sales of semiconductor products and related services represented approximately 49%, 45%, and 46%, of the company's consolidated sales in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The sale of the company's PEMCO products closely tracks the semiconductor market. Accordingly, the company's revenues and profitability, particularly in its global components business segment, tend to closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market. Further, economic weakness could cause a decline in spending in information technology, which could have a negative impact on the company's ECS business. A cyclical downturn in the technology industry could have a material adverse effect on the company's business and negatively impact its ability to maintain historical profitability levels.The company's non-U.S. sales represent a significant portion of its revenues, and consequently, the company is exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.In 2019, 2018, and 2017, approximately 60%, 59%, and 58%, respectively, of the company's sales came from its operations outside the United States. As a result of the company's international sales and locations, its operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following: •import and export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;•the burden and cost of compliance with international laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations; •potential restrictions on transfers of funds;10•import and export tariffs, duties and value-added taxes;•transportation delays and interruptions;•the burden and cost of compliance with complex multi-national tax laws and regulations;•uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations; •foreign laws that potentially discriminate against companies which are headquartered outside that jurisdiction;•stringent antitrust regulations in local jurisdictions;•volatility associated with sovereign debt of certain international economies;•the uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effects of Brexit; •potential military conflicts and political risks; and•currency fluctuations, which the company attempts to minimize through traditional hedging instruments.Also, the company's gross margins in the components business in the Asia-Pacific region tend to be lower than those in the other markets in which the company sells products and services. If sales in this market increases as a percentage of overall sales, consolidated gross margins will be lower. While the company has and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business abroad, it cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate and, therefore, such risks could have a material adverse effect on its business.Moreover, the company's effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by, among other things, changes in the mix of earnings among countries having different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets, and certain international tax policy efforts, including the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, the European Commission's state aid investigations, and other initiatives adversely affecting taxation of international businesses. Furthermore, many of the countries where the company is subject to taxes are independently evaluating their tax policy and some have already passed tax legislation which affect international businesses.  For instance, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted tax legislation (""Tax Act""), which significantly changed the tax laws by favorably reducing the corporate federal tax rate (35% to 21%) and moving to a territorial system, while simultaneously imposing an unfavorable one-time tax on accumulated foreign earnings, limiting deductibility of certain import related costs, including interest expense, and creating a new tax on certain international activities. Additionally, tax returns are subject to periodic audits by U.S. and foreign tax authorities, and these audits may result in allocations of income and/or deductions that may result in tax assessments different from amounts that have been estimated. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these audits to determine the adequacy of the company's provision for taxes. Such tax changes, to the extent they are brought against the company, could increase the effective tax rates in many of the countries where the company has operations and ultimately could have an adverse effect on overall tax liability, along with increasing the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance, all of which could impact the company's operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.When the company makes acquisitions, it may take on additional liabilities or not be able to successfully integrate such acquisitions.As part of the company's history and growth strategy, it has acquired other businesses. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:•effectively combining the acquired operations, technologies, or products;•unanticipated costs or assumed liabilities, including those associated with regulatory actions or investigations;•not realizing the anticipated financial benefit from the acquired companies;•diversion of management's attention;•negative effects on existing customer and supplier relationships; and•potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies.Further, the company has made, and may continue to make acquisitions of, or investments in new services, businesses or technologies to expand its current service offerings and product lines. Some of these may involve risks that may differ from those traditionally associated with the company's core distribution business, including undertaking product or service warranty responsibilities that in its traditional core business would generally reside primarily with its suppliers. If the company is not successful in mitigating or insuring against such risks, it could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.The company's goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of its assets and reduce its net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the assets acquired. The company also ascribes value to certain identifiable intangible assets, which consist primarily of customer relationships and trade names, among others, as a result of acquisitions. The company may incur impairment charges on goodwill or identifiable intangible assets if it determines 11that the fair values of the goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are less than their current carrying values. The company evaluates, on a regular basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary. For example, during the second quarter of 2019, based in part on the company's downward revision of forecasted future earnings and the decision to wind down its personal computer and mobility asset disposition business, the company conducted an interim goodwill impairment analysis related to the Americas components and Asia-Pacific components reporting units. As a result of the impairment analysis, the company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $570.2 million. Additionally, the company recorded a non-cash trade name impairment charge of $46.0 million in connection with an initiative to further integrate two global components businesses.Refer to Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and “Critical Accounting Policies” in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion of the impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. A decline in general economic conditions, a substantial increase in market interest rates, or the company's inability to meet long term working capital or operating income projections could impact future valuations of the company's reporting units, and the company could be required to record an impairment charge in the future, which could impact the company's consolidated balance sheets, as well as the company's consolidated statements of operations. If the company were required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the company's consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, North America asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings.If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discovers material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.An effective internal control environment is necessary for the company to produce reliable financial reports, safeguard assets, and is an important part of its effort to prevent financial fraud. The company is required to annually evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal controls over financial reporting. Based on these evaluations, the company may conclude that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable. While management evaluates the effectiveness of the company's internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment. In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate financial statement risk. If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or the company's independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in the company's internal controls, it may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. In addition, the company may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or the NYSE. Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the company's financial statements, which could cause the market price of its common stock to decline or limit the company's access to capital.The company's success depends upon its key executives and the strategies they develop. Any failure to attract and retain necessary talent may materially and adversely affect the company's business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. The company's success depends, to a significant extent, on the capability, expertise, and continued services of its senior management team. The company relies on the expertise and experience of certain key executives in developing business strategies, business operations, and maintaining relationships with customers and suppliers. If the company were to lose any of its key executives, it may not be able to find a suitable replacement with comparable knowledge and experience. The company may also need to offer better remuneration and other benefits to attract and retain key executives and therefore cannot be assured that costs and expenses will not increase significantly as a result of increased talent acquisition and retention cost. Cyber security and privacy breaches may hurt the company's business, damage its reputation, increase its costs, and cause losses.The company's information technology systems could be subject to invasion, cyber-attack, or data privacy breaches by employees, others with authorized access, and unauthorized persons. Such attacks could result in disruption to the company's operations and/or loss or disclosure of, or damage to, the company's or any of its customer's or supplier's data, confidential information, or reputation. The company's information technology systems security measures may also be breached due to employee error, 12malfeasance, or otherwise. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or suppliers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the company's data and information technology systems. Any such breach could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to the company's reputation, loss of competitive advantage, and a loss of confidence in the security of the company's information technology systems that could potentially have an impact on the company's business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade, or sabotage the company's information technology systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched, the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Further, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services for the company's operations, could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure.The company makes investments seeking to address risks and vulnerabilities, including ongoing monitoring, updating networks and systems, and personnel awareness training of potential cybersecurity threats to help ensure employees remain diligent in identifying potential risks. In addition, the company has deployed monitoring capabilities to support early detection, internal and external escalation, and effective responses to potential anomalies. As part of the company's regular review of potential risks, the company analyzes emerging cyber security threats as well as the company's plan and strategies to address them and presents them to senior management. Although the company has developed systems and processes that are designed to protect information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach, such measures cannot provide absolute security. Such breaches, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in the company incurring costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, or taking other remedial steps.Also, global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. The company's failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others. Although the company has insurance coverage for protecting against loss from cyber security and privacy risks, it may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and the company may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on its business.Restrictions on immigration or changes in immigration laws could limit the company's access to qualified and skilled professionals, increase the cost of doing business, or otherwise disrupt operations.Restrictions on immigration or changes in immigration laws could limit the company's access to qualified and skilled professionals, increase the cost of doing business, or otherwise disrupt operations. The success of portions of the company's business is dependent on its ability to recruit engineers and other professionals. Immigration laws in the U.S. and other countries in which the company operates are subject to legislative changes, as well as variations in the standards of application and enforcement due to political forces and economic conditions. It is difficult to predict the political and economic events that could affect immigration laws, or the restrictive impact they could have on obtaining or renewing work visas. If immigration laws are changed or if new more restrictive government regulations are enacted or increased, the company's access to qualified and skilled professionals may be limited, the costs of doing business may increase or operations may be disrupted.The company relies heavily on its internal information systems, which, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect the company's business.The company's current global operations reside on multiple technology platforms.  The size and complexity of the company's computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, and random attack. The company relies on a global enterprise resource planning (""ERP"") system to standardize its global components processes worldwide and adopt best-in-class capabilities. The company committed significant resources to this new ERP system, which replaced multiple legacy systems of the company. This conversion was extremely complex, in part, because of the wide range of processes and the multiple legacy systems that must be integrated globally. To date, the company has not experienced any identifiable significant issues.  Failure to properly or adequately address any unaccounted for or unforeseen issues could impact the company's ability to perform necessary business operations, which could materially adversely affect the company's business.The company may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees and could limit the company's ability to use certain technologies in the future.Certain of the company's products and services include intellectual property owned primarily by the company's third party suppliers and, to a lesser extent, the company itself. Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the semiconductor/integrated circuit, software and some service industries. From time to time, third parties (including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent, copyright and/or other intellectual property rights to 13technologies that are important to the company's business. In some cases, depending on the nature of the claim, the company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that the company is fully protected against such claims. In addition, the company is exposed to potential liability for technology that it develops itself or when it combines multiple technologies of its suppliers for which it may have limited or no indemnification protections. In any dispute involving products or services that incorporate intellectual property from multiple sources or is developed, licensed by the company, or obtained through acquisition, the company's customers could also become the targets of litigation. The company may be obligated in many instances to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the company sells are alleged to infringe any third party's intellectual property rights. Any infringement claim brought against the company, regardless of the duration, outcome, or size of damage award, could:•result in substantial cost to the company;•divert management's attention and resources;•be time consuming to defend;•result in substantial damage awards; or•cause product shipment delays.Additionally, if an infringement claim is successful, the company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase the company's operating expenses and harm the company's operating results and financial condition. Also, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all. The company may have to stop selling certain products or using technologies, which could affect the company's ability to compete effectively. General business conditions are vulnerable to the effects of epidemics, such as the coronavirus, which could materially disrupt the company’s business. The company is vulnerable to the general economic effects of epidemics and other public health crises, such as the novel strain of coronavirus reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China in 2019.  Due to the recent outbreak of the coronavirus, there has been a substantial curtailment of travel and business activities, particularly to and from China.  China has also limited the shipment of products in and out of its borders, which could negatively impact the company’s ability to receive products from its China-based suppliers and its ability to ship products to customers in that region.   In addition, the company has significant operations in China and it is uncertain how long the threat will last or when trade restrictions will be lifted.  Further, the epidemic could have a negative impact on operations outside of China.  Supply chain disruptions could negatively impact the company’s sales in EMEA and North America.  If not resolved quickly, the impact of the epidemic could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business"
9,ARW,ARROW ELECTRONICS INC,2019-02-07,"Risk Factors
. Described below and throughout this report are certain risks that the company's management believes are applicable to the company's business and the industries in which it operates.  If any of the described events occur, the company's business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected.  When stated below that a risk may have a material adverse effect on the company's business, it means that such risk may have one or more of these effects.  There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known.  There are also risks within the economy, the industry, and the capital markets that could materially adversely affect the company, including those associated with an economic recession, inflation, a global economic slowdown, political instability, employee attraction and retention, and those associated with customers' inability or refusal to pay for the products and services provided by the company. There are also risks associated with the occurrence of natural disasters such as tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods. These factors affect businesses generally, including the company, its customers and suppliers and, as a result, are not discussed in detail below, but are applicable to the company. Included below are some risks pertaining to specific government regulation, however, not all regulations applicable to the company or unanticipated regulation changes (such as changes in tax regulations in the various geographies we operate) have been described. The continuing expansion of government laws and regulations, some that may apply specifically to the company's industry and others to the market generally, as well as any actions taken by activist investors, could negatively impact the company's profitability. If the company is unable to maintain its relationships with its suppliers or if the suppliers materially change the terms of their existing agreements with the company, the company's business could be materially adversely affected. A substantial portion of the company's inventory is purchased from suppliers with which the company has entered into non-exclusive distribution agreements.  These agreements are typically cancelable on short notice (generally 30 to 90 days). Some of the company's businesses rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide a high percentage of their revenues. For example, sales of products from one of the company's suppliers accounted for approximately 9% of the company's consolidated sales. To the extent that the company's significant suppliers reduce the number of products they sell through distribution, are unwilling to continue to do business with the company, or are unable to continue to meet or significantly alter their obligations, the company's business could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, to the extent that the company's suppliers modify the terms of their contracts to the detriment of the company, limit supplies due to capacity constraints, or other factors, there could be a material adverse effect on the company's business. Further, the supplier landscape has experienced a consolidation, which could negatively impact the company if the surviving, consolidated suppliers decide to exclude the company from their supply chain efforts.The competitive pressures the company faces could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.The company operates in a highly competitive international environment. The company competes with other large multinational and national electronic components and enterprise computing solutions distributors, as well as numerous other smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on narrower markets, products, industries, or particular sectors. The company also competes for customers with its suppliers. The size of the company's competitors vary across market sectors, as do the resources the company has allocated to the sectors in which it does business. Therefore, some of the company's competitors may have a more extensive customer and/or supplier base than the company in one or more of its market sectors. There is significant competition within each market sector and geography that creates pricing pressure and the need for constant attention to improve services. Other competitive factors include rapid technological changes, product availability, credit availability, speed of delivery, ability to tailor solutions to customer needs, quality and depth of product lines and training, as well as service and support provided by the distributor to the customer.  The company also faces competition from companies in the logistics and product fulfillment, catalog distribution, and e-commerce supply chain services markets. As the company continues to expand its business into new areas in order to stay competitive in the market, such as in the area of the ""Internet of Things"" and its expansion in the digital market, the company may encounter increased competition from its current and/or new competitors. The company's failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could have a material adverse effect on its business.The company may not be able to adequately anticipate, prevent, or mitigate damage resulting from criminal and other illegal or fraudulent activities committed against it.It is clear that global businesses like ours are facing increasing risks of criminal, illegal, and other fraudulent acts.  The evolving nature of such threats, in light of new and sophisticated methods used by criminals, including phishing, misrepresentation, social engineering and forgery, are making it increasingly difficult for us to anticipate and adequately mitigate these risks. In addition, designing and implementing measures to defend against, prevent, and detect these types of activities are increasingly costly and invasive into the operations of the business.  As a result, we could experience a material loss in the future to the extent that controls and other measures we implement to address these threats fail to prevent or detect such acts.7Products sold by the company may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against the company, which may have a material adverse effect on the company.  The company sells its components at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. As a result, the company may face claims for damages (such as consequential damages) that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits it receives from the components involved in the claims.  While the company typically has provisions in its supplier agreements that hold the supplier accountable for defective products, and the company and its suppliers generally exclude consequential damages in their standard terms and conditions, the company's ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited as a result of differing factors, such as the inability to exclude such damages due to the laws of some of the countries where it does business.  The company's business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in the products sold by the company, if it is required to pay for the associated damages.  Although the company currently has product liability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage and amount. Further, when relying on contractual liability exclusions, the company could lose customers if their claims are not addressed to their satisfaction.  Declines in value and other factors pertaining to the company's inventory could materially adversely affect its business. The market for the company's products and services is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in end-market demand, oversupply of product, and regulatory requirements, which can contribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of inventory.  Although most of the company's suppliers provide the company with certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and certain rights of return), the company cannot be sure that such protections will fully compensate it for the loss in value, or that the suppliers will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements.  For example, many of the company's suppliers will not allow products to be returned after they have been held in inventory beyond a certain amount of time, and, in most instances, the return rights are limited to a certain percentage of the amount of product the company purchased in a particular time frame.  All of these factors pertaining to inventory could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.The company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could materially adversely affect its business. A number of jurisdictions in which the company's products are sold have enacted laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other related matters. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of the company's products and impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters.  Failure to comply with these laws or any other applicable environmental regulations could result in fines or suspension of sales.  Additionally, these directives and regulations may result in the company having non-compliant inventory that may be less readily salable or have to be written off.  Some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from the company's currently or formerly owned, leased, or operated property, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination.  As the distribution business, in general, does not involve the manufacture of products, it is typically not subject to significant liability in this area.  However, there may be occasions, including through acquisitions, where environmental liability arises. Two sites for which the company assumed responsibility as part of the Wyle Electronics (""Wyle"") acquisition are known to have environmental issues, one at Norco, California and the other at Huntsville, Alabama.  The company was also named as a defendant in a private lawsuit filed in connection with alleged contamination at a small industrial building formerly leased by Wyle Laboratories in El Segundo, California.  The lawsuit was settled, but the possibility remains that government entities or others may attempt to involve the company in further characterization or remediation of groundwater issues in the area.  The presence of environmental contamination could also interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect the company's ability to sell or lease its properties.  The discovery of contamination for which the company is responsible, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing requirements are enforced, could require the company to incur costs for compliance or subject it to unexpected liabilities.  Expansion into the electronic asset disposition market has broadened the company's risk profile. The company provides services related to electronic devices being disposed of by business customers. These services include, the data sanitation of storage devices from customer equipment and either recycling the equipment through resale or disposing of it in an environmentally compliant manner.  The company may also hold equipment in order to protect and preserve customer data.  If the company does not meet its contractual and regulatory obligations with respect to such data, it could be subject to financial damages, penalties, and damage to reputation.  Also, the company's or its subcontractors' failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations in disposing of the equipment could result in liability.  Such environmental liability may be 8joint and several, meaning that the company could be held responsible for more than its share of the liability involved.   To the extent that company fails to comply with its obligations and such failure is not covered by insurance, the company's business could be adversely affected.The company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources. The company requires cash or committed liquidity facilities for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital, acquisitions, and capital expenditure needs, as well as to refinance indebtedness.  At December 31, 2018, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $509.3 million.  In addition, the company currently has access to committed credit lines of $2.0 billion and a committed asset securitization program of $1.2 billion, of which the company had outstanding borrowings of $810.0 million at December 31, 2018. The company's ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond its control. The company may, in the future, need to access the financial markets to satisfy its cash needs.  The company's ability to obtain external financing is affected by various factors including general financial market conditions and the company's debt ratings.  Further, any increase in the company's level of debt, change in status of its debt from unsecured to secured debt, or deterioration of its operating results may cause a reduction in its current debt ratings. Any downgrade in the company's current debt rating or tightening of credit availability could impair the company's ability to obtain additional financing or renew existing credit facilities on acceptable terms.  Under the terms of any external financing, the company may incur higher financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants. For example, the company's existing debt agreements contain restrictive covenants, including covenants requiring compliance with specified financial ratios, and a failure to comply with these or any other covenants may result in an event of default.  An increase in the company's financing costs or loss of access to cost-effective capital resources could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.The agreements governing some of the company's financing arrangements contain various covenants and restrictions that limit some of management's discretion in operating the business and could prevent the company from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to its business.The agreements governing the company's financings contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, could limit its ability to:•grant liens on assets;•make investments;•merge, consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets;•incur additional debt; or•engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the company may be limited in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, compete effectively, or make investments.The company's lack of long-term sales contracts may have a material adverse effect on its business.Most of the company's sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts.  The company generally works with its customers to develop non-binding forecasts for future orders.  Based on such non-binding forecasts, the company makes commitments regarding the level of business that it will seek and accept, the inventory that it purchases, and the levels of utilization of personnel and other resources.  A variety of conditions, both specific to each customer and generally affecting each customer's industry may cause customers to cancel, reduce, or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated, file for bankruptcy protection or fail, or default on their payments.  Generally, customers cancel, reduce, or delay purchase orders and commitments without penalty.  The company seeks to mitigate these risks, in some cases, by entering into noncancelable/nonreturnable sales agreements, but there is no guarantee that such agreements will adequately protect the company.  Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays in orders by customers, loss of customers, and/or customer defaults on payments could materially adversely affect the company's business.The company's revenues originate primarily from the sales of semiconductor, PEMCO (passive, electro-mechanical and connector), IT hardware and software products, the sales of which are traditionally cyclical. The semiconductor industry historically has experienced fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity and subject to significant economic market upturns and downturns.  Sales of 9semiconductor products and related services represented approximately 45%, 46%, and 42% of the company's consolidated sales in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.  The sale of the company's PEMCO products closely tracks the semiconductor market.  Accordingly, the company's revenues and profitability, particularly in its global components business segment, tend to closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market.  Further, economic weakness could cause a decline in spending in information technology, which could have a negative impact on the company's ECS business. A cyclical downturn in the technology industry could have a material adverse effect on the company's business and negatively impact its ability to maintain historical profitability levels.The company's non-U.S. sales represent a significant portion of its revenues, and consequently, the company is exposed to risks associated with operating internationally. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, approximately 59%, 58%, and 57%, respectively, of the company's sales came from its operations outside the United States.  As a result of the company's international sales and locations, its operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following: •import and export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;•the burden and cost of compliance with international laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations; •potential restrictions on transfers of funds;•import and export duties and value-added taxes;•transportation delays and interruptions;•the burden and cost of compliance with complex multi-national tax laws and regulations;•uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations; •enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or similar laws of other jurisdictions;•foreign laws that potentially discriminate against companies which are headquartered outside that jurisdiction;•volatility associated with sovereign debt of certain international economies;•the uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effects of Brexit; •potential military conflicts and political risks; and•currency fluctuations, which the company attempts to minimize through traditional hedging instruments.Furthermore, products the company sells which are either manufactured in the United States or based on U.S. technology (""U.S. Products"") are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (""EAR"") when exported and re-exported to and from all international jurisdictions, in addition to the local jurisdiction's export regulations applicable to individual shipments.  Licenses or proper license exemptions may be required by local jurisdictions' export regulations, including EAR, for the shipment of certain U.S. Products to certain countries, including China, India, Russia, and other countries in which the company operates.  Non-compliance with the EAR or other applicable export regulations can result in a wide range of penalties including the denial of export privileges, fines, criminal penalties, and the seizure of inventories.  In the event that any export regulatory body determines that any shipments made by the company violate the applicable export regulations, the company could be fined significant sums and/or its export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.Also, the company's gross margins in the components business in the Asia/Pacific region tend to be lower than those in the other markets in which the company sells products and services.  If sales in this market increase as a percentage of overall sales, consolidated gross margins will be lower. While the company has and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business abroad, it cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on its business.Moreover, our effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by, among other things, changes in the mix of our earnings among countries having different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets, and certain international tax policy efforts, including the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (""OECD"") Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (""BEPS"") Project, the European Commission’s state aid investigations, and other initiatives adversely affecting taxation of international businesses. Furthermore, many of the countries where we are subject to taxes are independently evaluating their tax policy and some have already passed tax legislation which affect international businesses.  For instance, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted tax legislation (""Tax Act""), which significantly changed the tax laws by favorably reducing the corporate federal tax rate (35% to 21%) and moving to a territorial system, while simultaneously imposing an unfavorable one-time tax on accumulated foreign earnings, limiting deductibility of certain import related costs, including interest expense, and creating a new tax on certain international activities. Additionally, our tax returns are subject to periodic audits by U.S. and foreign tax authorities, and these audits may result in allocations of income and/or deductions that may result in tax assessments different from amounts that we have estimated. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these audits to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. Such tax changes, to the extent they are brought against us, could increase 10our effective tax rates in many of the countries where we have operations and ultimately have an adverse effect on our overall tax liability, along with increasing the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance, all of which could impact our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.When the company makes acquisitions, it may take on additional liabilities or not be able to successfully integrate such acquisitions.As part of the company's history and growth strategy, it has acquired other businesses.  Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:•effectively combining the acquired operations, technologies, or products;•unanticipated costs or assumed liabilities, including those associated with regulatory actions or investigations;•not realizing the anticipated financial benefit from the acquired companies;•diversion of management's attention;•negative effects on existing customer and supplier relationships; and•potential loss of key employees, especially those of the acquired companies.Further, the company has made, and may continue to make acquisitions of, or investments in new services, businesses or technologies to expand its current service offerings and product lines.  Some of these may involve risks that may differ from those traditionally associated with the company's core distribution business, including undertaking product or service warranty responsibilities that in its traditional core business would generally reside primarily with its suppliers. If the company is not successful in mitigating or insuring against such risks, it could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.The company's goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of its assets and reduce its net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the assets acquired.  The company also ascribes value to certain identifiable intangible assets, which consist primarily of customer relationships and trade names, among others, as a result of acquisitions.  The company may incur impairment charges on goodwill or identifiable intangible assets if it determines that the fair values of the goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are less than their current carrying values.  The company evaluates, on a regular basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary.  Refer to Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and 'Critical Accounting Policies' in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion of the impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.  A decline in general economic conditions, a substantial increase in market interest rates, or the company’s inability to meet long term working capital or operating income projections could impact  future valuations of the company's reporting units, and the company could be required to record an impairment charge in the future, which could impact the company's consolidated balance sheet, as well as the company's consolidated statement of operations. If the company was required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the company's consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings.If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discovers material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. An effective internal control environment is necessary for the company to produce reliable financial reports, safeguard assets, and is an important part of its effort to prevent financial fraud.  The company is required to annually evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal controls over financial reporting.  Based on these evaluations, the company may conclude that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable.  While management evaluates the effectiveness of the company's internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective.  There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment.  In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate financial statement risk.  If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or the company's independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in the company's internal controls, it may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.  In addition, the company may be subject 11to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or the NYSE.  Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the company's financial statements, which could cause the market price of its common stock to decline or limit the company's access to capital.Cyber security and privacy breaches may hurt the company’s business, damage its reputation, increase its costs, and cause losses.The company’s information technology systems could be subject to invasion, cyber-attack, or data privacy breaches by employees, others with authorized access, and unauthorized persons. Such attacks could result in disruption to the company’s operations, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, the company’s or any of its customer’s or supplier’s data, confidential information, or reputation. The company’s information technology systems security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or suppliers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the company’s data and information technology systems. Any such breach could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to the company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, and a loss of confidence in the security of the company’s information technology systems that could potentially have an impact on the company’s business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade, or sabotage the company’s information technology systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched, the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Further, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services for the company’s operations, could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that the company procures from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including ""bugs"" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the company’s information technology systems.The company makes investments seeking to address risks and vulnerabilities, including ongoing monitoring, updating networks and systems, and personnel awareness training of potential cybersecurity threats to help ensure employees remain diligent in identifying potential risks. In addition, we have deployed monitoring capabilities to support early detection, internal and external escalation, and effective responses to potential anomalies. As part of the company’s regular review of potential risks, the company analyzes emerging cybersecurity threats as well as the company’s plan and strategies to address them and presents them to senior management.  Although the company has developed systems and processes that are designed to protect information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach, such measures cannot provide absolute security. Such breaches, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in the company incurring costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, or taking other remedial steps.Also, global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. The company’s failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others. Although the company has insurance coverage for protecting against loss from cyber security risks, it may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and the company may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on its business.The company relies heavily on its internal information systems, which, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect the company's business. The company's current global operations reside on multiple technology platforms.  The size and complexity of the company's computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, and random attack.In 2018, the company completed the process of implementing a global enterprise resource planning (""ERP"") system to standardize its global components processes worldwide and adopt best-in-class capabilities.  The company committed significant resources to this new ERP system, which replaced multiple legacy systems of the company.  This conversion was extremely complex, in part, because of the wide range of processes and the multiple legacy systems that must be integrated globally.  To date, the company has not experienced any identifiable significant issues.  Failure to properly or adequately address any unaccounted for or unforeseen issues could impact the company's ability to perform necessary business operations, which could materially adversely affect the company's business.The company may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees and could limit the company's ability to use certain technologies in the future.Certain of the company's products and services include intellectual property owned primarily by the company's third party suppliers and, to a lesser extent, the company itself.  Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist 12in the semiconductor/integrated circuit, software and some service industries.  From time to time, third parties (including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent, copyright and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company's business.   In some cases, depending on the nature of the claim, the company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that the company is fully protected against such claims.  In addition, the company is exposed to potential liability for technology that it develops itself or combines multiple technologies of its suppliers for which it may have limited or no indemnification protections.  In any dispute involving products or services that incorporate intellectual property from multiple sources or is developed, licensed by the company, or obtained through acquisition, the company's customers could also become the targets of litigation.  The company is obligated in many instances to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the company sells are alleged to infringe any third party's intellectual property rights.  Any infringement claim brought against the company, regardless of the duration, outcome, or size of damage award, could:•result in substantial cost to the company;•divert management's attention and resources;•be time consuming to defend;•result in substantial damage awards; or•cause product shipment delays.Additionally, if an infringement claim is successful, the company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.  The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase the company's operating expenses and harm the company's operating results and financial condition.  Also, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all.  The company may have to stop selling certain products or using technologies, which could affect the company's ability to compete effectively.    Compliance with government regulations regarding the use of ""conflict minerals"" may result in increased costs and risks to the company.  As part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the ""Act""), the SEC has promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, known as conflict minerals.  The disclosure rules were effective in May 2014.  The company must publicly disclose the process it took to determine whether it manufactures (as defined in the Act) any products that contain conflict minerals.  Customers typically rely on the company to provide critical data regarding the parts they purchase, including conflict mineral information.  The company's material sourcing is broad-based and multi-tiered, and it is not able to easily verify the origins for conflict minerals used in all of the products it sells.  The company has many suppliers and each provides conflict mineral information in a different manner, if at all.  Accordingly, because the supply chain is complex, the company may face reputational challenges if it is unable to sufficiently verify the origins of conflict minerals used in its products.  Additionally, customers may demand that the products they purchase be free of conflict minerals.  This may limit the number of suppliers that can provide products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or at competitive prices.   New tariffs may result in increased prices and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Recently, the U.S. government imposed tariffs on certain products imported into the U.S. and the Chinese government imposed tariffs on certain products imported into China, which have increased the prices of many of the products that the company purchases from its suppliers. The new tariffs, along with any additional tariffs or trade restrictions that may be implemented by the U.S. or other countries, could result in further increased prices. While the company intends to pass price increases on to our customers, the effect of tariffs on prices may impact sales and results of operations. Retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods have not yet had a significant impact, but we cannot predict further developments. The tariffs and the additional operational costs incurred in minimizing the number of products subject to the tariffs could adversely affect the operating profits for certain of our businesses and customer demand for certain products which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations"
15,ARW,ARROW ELECTRONICS INC,2018-02-06,"Risk Factors
. Described below and throughout this report are certain risks that the company's management believes are applicable to the company's business and the industries in which it operates.  If any of the described events occur, the company's business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected.  When stated below that a risk may have a material adverse effect on the company's business, it means that such risk may have one or more of these effects.  There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known.  There are also risks within the economy, the industry, and the capital markets that could materially adversely affect the company, including those associated with an economic recession, inflation, a global economic slowdown, political instability, employee attraction and retention, and those associated with customers' inability or refusal to pay for the products and services provided by the company. There are also risks associated with the occurrence of natural disasters such as tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods. These factors affect businesses generally, including the company's customers and suppliers and, as a result, are not discussed in detail below except to the extent such conditions could materially affect the company and its customers and suppliers in particular ways. Included below are some risks pertaining to specific government regulation, however, not all regulations applicable to the company or unanticipated regulation changes (such as changes in tax regulations in the various geographies we operate) have been described. The continuing expansion of government laws and regulations, some that may apply specifically to the company's industry and others to the market generally, as well as any actions taken by activist investors, could negatively impact the company's profitability.If the company is unable to maintain its relationships with its suppliers or if the suppliers materially change the terms of their existing agreements with the company, the company's business could be materially adversely affected. A substantial portion of the company's inventory is purchased from suppliers with which the company has entered into non-exclusive distribution agreements.  These agreements are typically cancelable on short notice (generally 30 to 90 days). Some of the company's businesses rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide a high percentage of their revenues. For example, sales of products from one of the company's suppliers accounted for approximately 7.8% of the company's consolidated sales. To the extent that the company's significant suppliers reduce the number of products they sell through distribution, are unwilling to continue to do business with the company, or are unable to continue to meet or significantly alter their obligations, the company's business could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, to the extent that the company's suppliers modify the terms of their contracts to the detriment of the company, limit supplies due to capacity constraints, or other factors, there could be a material adverse effect on the company's business. Further, the supplier landscape has experienced a consolidation, which could negatively impact the company if the surviving, consolidated suppliers decide to exclude the company from their supply chain efforts.The competitive pressures the company faces could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.The company operates in a highly competitive international environment. The company competes with other large multinational and national electronic components and enterprise computing solutions distributors, as well as numerous other smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on narrower markets, products, industries, or particular sectors. The company also competes for customers with its suppliers. The size of the company's competitors vary across market sectors, as do the resources the company has allocated to the sectors in which it does business. Therefore, some of the company's competitors may have a more extensive customer and/or supplier base than the company in one or more of its market sectors. There is significant competition within each market sector and geography that creates pricing pressure and the need for constant attention to improve services. Other competitive factors include rapid technological changes, product availability, credit availability, speed of delivery, ability to tailor solutions to customer needs, quality and depth of product lines and training, as well as service and support provided by the distributor to the customer.  The company also faces competition from companies in the logistics and product fulfillment, catalog distribution, and e-commerce supply chain services markets. As the company continues to expand its business into new areas in order to stay competitive in the market, such as in the area of the ""Internet of Things"" and its expansion in the digital market, the company may encounter increased competition from its current and/or new competitors. The company's failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could have a material adverse effect on its business.The company was the victim of fraud and may not be able to adequately anticipate, prevent, or mitigate damage resulting from criminal and other illegal or fraudulent activities committed against it.The company determined that it was the target of criminal fraud by persons impersonating a company executive, which resulted in unauthorized transfers of cash from a company account in Europe to outside bank accounts in Asia in January 2016.   This was an isolated event not associated with a security breach or loss of data.  The company determined that its internal controls did not operate effectively to prevent or timely detect the unauthorized cash disbursements.  As a result, company management initiated a thorough and detailed remediation plan.  The company does not believe that these deficiencies had an adverse effect on its reported operating results or financial condition.7It is clear that global businesses like ours are facing increasing risks of criminal, illegal, and other fraudulent acts.  The evolving nature of such threats, in light of new and sophisticated methods used by criminals, including phishing, misrepresentation, social engineering and forgery, are making it increasingly difficult for us to anticipate and adequately mitigate these risks. In addition, designing and implementing measures to defend against, prevent, and detect these types of activities are increasingly costly and invasive into the operations of the business.  As a result, we could experience a material loss in the future to the extent that controls and other measures we implement to address these threats fail to prevent or detect such acts.Products sold by the company may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against the company, which may have a material adverse effect on the company.  The company sells its components at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. As a result, the company may face claims for damages (such as consequential damages) that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits it receives from the components involved in the claims.  While the company typically has provisions in its supplier agreements that hold the supplier accountable for defective products, and the company and its suppliers generally exclude consequential damages in their standard terms and conditions, the company's ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited as a result of differing factors, such as the inability to exclude such damages due to the laws of some of the countries where it does business.  The company's business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in the products sold by the company, if it is required to pay for the associated damages.  Although the company currently has product liability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage and amount. Further, when relying on contractual liability exclusions, the company could lose customers if their claims are not addressed to their satisfaction.  Declines in value and other factors pertaining to the company's inventory could materially adversely affect its business. The market for the company's products and services is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in end-market demand, oversupply of product, and regulatory requirements, which can contribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of inventory.  Although most of the company's suppliers provide the company with certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and certain rights of return), the company cannot be sure that such protections will fully compensate it for the loss in value, or that the suppliers will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements.  For example, many of the company's suppliers will not allow products to be returned after they have been held in inventory beyond a certain amount of time, and, in most instances, the return rights are limited to a certain percentage of the amount of product the company purchased in a particular time frame.  All of these factors pertaining to inventory could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.The company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could materially adversely affect its business. A number of jurisdictions in which the company's products are sold have enacted laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other related matters. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of the company's products and impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters.  Failure to comply with these laws or any other applicable environmental regulations could result in fines or suspension of sales.  Additionally, these directives and regulations may result in the company having non-compliant inventory that may be less readily salable or have to be written off.  Some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from the company's currently or formerly owned, leased, or operated property, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination.  As the distribution business, in general, does not involve the manufacture of products, it is typically not subject to significant liability in this area.  However, there may be occasions, including through acquisitions, where environmental liability arises. Two sites for which the company assumed responsibility as part of the Wyle Electronics (""Wyle"") acquisition are known to have environmental issues, one at Norco, California and the other at Huntsville, Alabama.  The company was also named as a defendant in a private lawsuit filed in connection with alleged contamination at a small industrial building formerly leased by Wyle Laboratories in El Segundo, California.  The lawsuit was settled, but the possibility remains that government entities or others may attempt to involve the company in further characterization or remediation of groundwater issues in the area.  The presence of environmental contamination could also interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect the company's ability to sell or lease its properties.  The discovery of contamination for which the company is responsible, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing requirements are enforced, could require the company to incur costs for compliance or subject it to unexpected liabilities.  8Expansion into the electronic asset disposition market has broadened the company's risk profile. The company provides services related to electronic devices being disposed of by business customers. These services include, the data sanitation of storage devices from customer equipment and either recycling the equipment through resale or disposing of it in an environmentally compliant manner.  The company may also hold equipment in order to protect and preserve customer data.  If the company does not meet its contractual and regulatory obligations with respect to such data, it could be subject to financial damages, penalties, and damage to reputation.  Also, the company's or its subcontractors' failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations in disposing of the equipment could result in liability.  Such environmental liability may be joint and several, meaning that the company could be held responsible for more than its share of the liability involved.   To the extent that company fails to comply with its obligations and such failure is not covered by insurance, the company's business could be adversely affected.The company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources. The company requires cash or committed liquidity facilities for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital, acquisitions, and capital expenditure needs, as well as to refinance indebtedness.  At December 31, 2017, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $730.1 million.  In addition, the company currently has access to committed credit lines of $1.8 billion and a committed asset securitization program of $910.0 million, of which the company had outstanding borrowings of $490.0 million at December 31, 2017. The company's ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond its control. The company may, in the future, need to access the financial markets to satisfy its cash needs.  The company's ability to obtain external financing is affected by various factors including general financial market conditions and the company's debt ratings.  Further, any increase in the company's level of debt, change in status of its debt from unsecured to secured debt, or deterioration of its operating results may cause a reduction in its current debt ratings. Any downgrade in the company's current debt rating or tightening of credit availability could impair the company's ability to obtain additional financing or renew existing credit facilities on acceptable terms.  Under the terms of any external financing, the company may incur higher financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants. For example, the company's existing debt agreements contain restrictive covenants, including covenants requiring compliance with specified financial ratios, and a failure to comply with these or any other covenants may result in an event of default.  The company's lack of access to cost-effective capital resources, an increase in the company's financing costs, or a breach of debt covenants could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. The agreements governing some of the company's financing arrangements contain various covenants and restrictions that limit some of management's discretion in operating the business and could prevent the company from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to its business.The agreements governing the company's financings contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, could limit its ability to:•grant liens on assets;•make investments;•merge, consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets;•incur additional debt; or•engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the company may be limited in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, compete effectively, or make investments.The company's failure to have long-term sales contracts may have a material adverse effect on its business.Most of the company's sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts.  The company generally works with its customers to develop non-binding forecasts for future orders.  Based on such non-binding forecasts, the company makes commitments regarding the level of business that it will seek and accept, the inventory that it purchases, and the levels of utilization of personnel and other resources.  A variety of conditions, both specific to each customer and generally affecting each customer's industry may cause customers to cancel, reduce, or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated, file for bankruptcy protection or fail, or default on their payments.  Generally, customers cancel, reduce, or delay purchase orders and commitments without penalty.  The company seeks to mitigate these risks, in some cases, by entering into noncancelable/nonreturnable sales agreements, but there is no guarantee that such agreements will adequately protect the company.  Significant 9or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays in orders by customers, loss of customers, and/or customer defaults on payments could materially adversely affect the company's business.The company's revenues originate primarily from the sales of semiconductor, PEMCO (passive, electro-mechanical and interconnect), IT hardware and software products, the sales of which are traditionally cyclical. The semiconductor industry historically has experienced fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity and subject to significant economic market upturns and downturns.  Sales of semiconductor products and related services represented approximately 46%, 42%, and 41% of the company's consolidated sales in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  The sale of the company's PEMCO products closely tracks the semiconductor market.  Accordingly, the company's revenues and profitability, particularly in its global components business segment, tend to closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market.  Further, economic weakness could cause a decline in spending in information technology, which could have a negative impact on the company's ECS business. A cyclical downturn in the technology industry could have a material adverse effect on the company's business and negatively impact its ability to maintain historical profitability levels.The company's non-U.S. sales represent a significant portion of its revenues, and consequently, the company is exposed to risks associated with operating internationally. In 2017, 2016, and 2015, approximately 58%, 56%, and 54%, respectively, of the company's sales came from its operations outside the United States.  As a result of the company's international sales and locations, its operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following: •import and export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;•the burden and cost of compliance with international laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations; •potential restrictions on transfers of funds;•import and export duties and value-added taxes;•transportation delays and interruptions;•the burden and cost of compliance with complex multi-national tax laws and regulations;•uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations; •enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or similar laws of other jurisdictions;•foreign laws that potentially discriminate against companies which are headquartered outside that jurisdiction;•volatility associated with sovereign debt of certain international economies;•the uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effects of Brexit; •potential military conflicts and political risks; and•currency fluctuations, which the company attempts to minimize through traditional hedging instruments.Furthermore, products the company sells which are either manufactured in the United States or based on U.S. technology (""U.S. Products"") are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (""EAR"") when exported and re-exported to and from all international jurisdictions, in addition to the local jurisdiction's export regulations applicable to individual shipments.  Licenses or proper license exemptions may be required by local jurisdictions' export regulations, including EAR, for the shipment of certain U.S. Products to certain countries, including China, India, Russia, and other countries in which the company operates.  Non-compliance with the EAR or other applicable export regulations can result in a wide range of penalties including the denial of export privileges, fines, criminal penalties, and the seizure of inventories.  In the event that any export regulatory body determines that any shipments made by the company violate the applicable export regulations, the company could be fined significant sums and/or its export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.Also, the company's gross margins in the components business in the Asia/Pacific region tend to be lower than those in the other markets in which the company sells products and services.  If sales in this market increase as a percentage of overall sales, consolidated gross margins will be lower.  The financial impact of lower gross profit on returns on working capital is offset, in part, by lower working capital requirements.  While the company has and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business abroad, it cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on its business.Certain tax policy efforts, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (""OECD"") Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (""BEPS"") Project, the European Commission’s state aid investigations, and other initiatives could have an adverse effect on the taxation of international businesses. Furthermore, many of the countries where we are subject to taxes are independently evaluating their tax policy and some have already passed tax legislation which affect international businesses.  For 10instance, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted tax legislation (""Tax Act""), which significantly changed the existing tax laws by favorably reducing the corporate federal tax rate (35% to 21%) and moving to a territorial system, while simultaneously imposing an unfavorable one-time tax on accumulated foreign earnings, limiting deductibility of certain import related costs, including interest expense, and creating a new tax on certain international activities. Such tax changes, to the extent they are brought into tax legislation, regulations, policies, or practices, could increase our effective tax rates in many of the countries where we have operations and have an adverse effect on our overall tax rate, along with increasing the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance, all of which could impact our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.When the company makes acquisitions, it may take on additional liabilities or not be able to successfully integrate such acquisitions.As part of the company's history and growth strategy, it has acquired other businesses.  Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:•effectively combining the acquired operations, technologies, or products;•unanticipated costs or assumed liabilities, including those associated with regulatory actions or investigations;•not realizing the anticipated financial benefit from the acquired companies;•diversion of management's attention;•negative effects on existing customer and supplier relationships; and•potential loss of key employees, especially those of the acquired companies.Further, the company has made, and may continue to make acquisitions of, or investments in new services, businesses or technologies to expand its current service offerings and product lines.  Some of these may involve risks that may differ from those traditionally associated with the company's core distribution business, including undertaking product or service warranty responsibilities that in its traditional core business would generally reside primarily with its suppliers. If the company is not successful in mitigating or insuring against such risks, it could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.The company's goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of its assets and reduce its net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the assets acquired.  The company also ascribes value to certain identifiable intangible assets, which consist primarily of customer relationships and trade names, among others, as a result of acquisitions.  The company may incur impairment charges on goodwill or identifiable intangible assets if it determines that the fair values of the goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are less than their current carrying values.  The company evaluates, on a regular basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary.  Refer to Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and 'Critical Accounting Policies' in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion of the impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.  A decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations could impact the judgments and assumptions about the fair value of the company's businesses and the company could be required to record impairment charges on its goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the future, which could impact the company's consolidated balance sheet, as well as the company's consolidated statement of operations. If the company is required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the company's consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, or capital resources. If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discovers material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. An effective internal control environment is necessary for the company to produce reliable financial reports, safeguard assets, and is an important part of its effort to prevent financial fraud.  The company is required to annually evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal controls over financial reporting.  Based on these evaluations, the company may conclude that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable.  While management evaluates the effectiveness of the company's internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective.  There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment.  In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate financial statement risk.  If the company fails to 11maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or the company's independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in the company's internal controls, it may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.  In addition, the company may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or the NYSE.  Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the company's financial statements, which could cause the market price of its common stock to decline or limit the company's access to capital.Cyber security and privacy breaches may hurt the company’s business, damage its reputation, increase its costs, and cause losses.The company’s information technology systems could be subject to invasion, cyber-attack, or data privacy breaches by employees, others with authorized access, and unauthorized persons. Such attacks could result in disruption to the company’s operations, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, the company’s or any of its customer’s or supplier’s data or confidential information. The company’s information technology systems security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or suppliers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the company’s data and information technology systems. Any such breach could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to the company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, and a loss of confidence in the security of the company’s information technology systems that could potentially have an impact on the company’s business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade, or sabotage the company’s information technology systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched, the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.  Further, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services for the company’s operations, could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that the company procures from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including ""bugs"" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the company’s information technology systems. Although the company has developed systems and processes that are designed to protect information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach, such measures cannot provide absolute security. Such breaches, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in the company incurring costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, or taking other remedial steps. Also, global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. The company’s failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others.  Although the company has insurance coverage for protecting against loss from cyber security risks, it may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and the company may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on its business.The company relies heavily on its internal information systems, which, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect the company's business. The company's current global operations reside on multiple technology platforms.  The size and complexity of the company's computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, and random attack.  In January 2018, the company completed the process of implementing a global enterprise resource planning (""ERP"") system to standardize its global components processes worldwide and adopt best-in-class capabilities.  The company has committed significant resources to this new ERP system, which replaces multiple legacy systems of the company.  This conversion has been extremely complex, in part, because of the wide range of processes and the multiple legacy systems that must be integrated globally.  The company used a controlled project plan that it believes will provide for the adequate allocation of resources and appropriate support.  To date, the company has not experienced any identifiable significant issues. However, there may be negative implications of which the company is not yet aware.  Failure to properly or adequately address any such issues could impact the company's ability to perform necessary business operations, which could materially adversely affect the company's business.The company may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees and could limit the company's ability to use certain technologies in the future.Certain of the company's products and services include intellectual property owned primarily by the company's third party suppliers and, to a lesser extent, the company itself.  Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the semiconductor/integrated circuit, software and some service industries.  From time to time, third parties (including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent, copyright and/or other intellectual property rights to 12technologies that are important to the company's business.   In some cases, depending on the nature of the claim, the company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that the company is fully protected against such claims.  In addition, the company is exposed to potential liability for technology that it develops itself or combines multiple technologies of its suppliers for which it may have limited or no indemnification protections.  In any dispute involving products or services that incorporate intellectual property from multiple sources or is developed, licensed by the company, or obtained through acquisition, the company's customers could also become the targets of litigation.  The company is obligated in many instances to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the company sells are alleged to infringe any third party's intellectual property rights.  Any infringement claim brought against the company, regardless of the duration, outcome, or size of damage award, could:•result in substantial cost to the company;•divert management's attention and resources;•be time consuming to defend;•result in substantial damage awards; or•cause product shipment delays.Additionally, if an infringement claim is successful, the company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.  The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase the company's operating expenses and harm the company's operating results and financial condition.  Also, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all.  The company may have to stop selling certain products or using technologies, which could affect the company's ability to compete effectively.    Compliance with government regulations regarding the use of ""conflict minerals"" may result in increased costs and risks to the company.  As part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the ""Act""), the SEC has promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, known as conflict minerals.  The disclosure rules were effective in May 2014.  The company must publicly disclose the process it took to determine whether it manufactures (as defined in the Act) any products that contain conflict minerals.  Customers typically rely on the company to provide critical data regarding the parts they purchase, including conflict mineral information.  The company's material sourcing is broad-based and multi-tiered, and it is not able to easily verify the origins for conflict minerals used in all of the products it sells.  The company has many suppliers and each provides conflict mineral information in a different manner, if at all.  Accordingly, because the supply chain is complex, the company may face reputational challenges if it is unable to sufficiently verify the origins of conflict minerals used in its products.  Additionally, customers may demand that the products they purchase be free of conflict minerals.  This may limit the number of suppliers that can provide products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or at competitive prices"
16,ARW,ARROW ELECTRONICS INC,2017-02-07,"Risk Factors
. Described below and throughout this report are certain risks that the company's management believes are applicable to the company's business and the industry in which it operates.  If any of the described events occur, the company's business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected.  When stated below that a risk may have a material adverse effect on the company's business, it means that such risk may have one or more of these effects.  There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known.  There are also risks within the economy, the industry, and the capital markets that could materially adversely affect the company, including those associated with an economic recession, inflation, a global economic slowdown, and those associated with customers' inability or refusal to pay for the products and services provided by the company. There are also risks associated with the occurrence of natural disasters such as tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods. These factors affect businesses generally, including the company's customers and suppliers and, as a result, are not discussed in detail below except to the extent such conditions could materially affect the company and its customers and suppliers in particular ways. Included below are some risks pertaining to specific government regulation, however, not all regulations applicable to the company or unanticipated regulation changes (such as changes in tax regulations in the various geographies we operate) have been described. The continuing expansion of government laws and regulations, some that may apply specifically to the company's industry and others to the market generally, as well as any actions taken by activist investors, could negatively impact the company's profitability.If the company is unable to maintain its relationships with its suppliers or if the suppliers materially change the terms of their existing agreements with the company, the company's business could be materially adversely affected. A substantial portion of the company's inventory is purchased from suppliers with which the company has entered into non-exclusive distribution agreements.  These agreements are typically cancelable on short notice (generally 30 to 90 days). Some of the company's businesses rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide a high percentage of their revenues. For example, sales of products from one of the company's components suppliers,   Instruments, accounted for approximately 7.5% of the company's consolidated sales. To the extent that the company's significant suppliers reduce the amount of products they sell through distribution, are unwilling to continue to do business with the company, or are unable to continue to meet or significantly alter their obligations, the company's business could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, to the extent that the company's suppliers modify the terms of their contracts with the company, limit supplies due to capacity constraints, or other factors, there could be a material adverse effect on the company's business.The competitive pressures the company faces could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.The company operates in a highly competitive international environment. The company competes with other large multinational and national electronic components and enterprise computing solutions distributors, as well as numerous other smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on narrower markets, products, or particular sectors. The company also competes for customers with its suppliers. The size of the company's competitors vary across market sectors, as do the resources the company has allocated to the sectors in which it does business. Therefore, some of the company's competitors may have a more extensive customer and/or supplier base than the company in one or more of its market sectors. There is significant competition within each market sector and geography that creates pricing pressure and the need for constant attention to improve services. Other competitive factors include rapid technological changes, product availability, credit availability, speed of delivery, ability to tailor solutions to customer needs, quality and depth of product lines and training, as well as service and support provided by the distributor to the customer.  The Company also faces competition from companies in the logistics and product fulfillment, catalog distribution, and e-commerce supply chain services markets. As the company continues to expand its business into new areas in order to stay competitive in the market, such as in the area of the ""Internet of Things"" and its expansion in the digital market, the company may encounter increased competition from its current and/or new competitors. The company's failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could have a material adverse effect on its business.The company was recently the victim of fraud and may not be able to adequately anticipate, prevent, or mitigate damage resulting from criminal and other illegal or fraudulent activities committed against it.The company determined that it was the target of criminal fraud by persons impersonating a company executive, which resulted in unauthorized transfers of cash from a company account in Europe to outside bank accounts in Asia in January 2016.   The information gathered by the company indicates that this was an isolated event not associated with a security breach or loss of data.  The company determined that its internal controls did not operate effectively to prevent or timely detect the unauthorized cash disbursements.  As a result, company management initiated a thorough and detailed remediation plan.  The company does not believe that these deficiencies had an adverse effect on its reported operating results or financial condition.7It is clear that global businesses like ours are facing increasing risks of criminal, illegal and other fraudulent acts.  The evolving nature of such threats, in light of new and sophisticated methods used by criminals, including phishing, misrepresentation, social engineering and forgery, are making it increasingly difficult for us to anticipate and adequately mitigate these risks. In addition, designing and implementing measures to defend against, prevent and detect these types of activities are increasingly costly and invasive into the operations of the business.  As a result, we could experience a material loss in the future to the extent that controls and other measures we implement to address these threats fail to prevent or detect such acts.Products sold by the company may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against the company, which may have a material adverse effect on the company.  The company sells its components at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. As a result, the company may face claims for damages (such as consequential damages) that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits it receives from the components involved in the claims.  While the company typically has provisions in its supplier agreements that hold the supplier accountable for defective products, and the company and its suppliers generally exclude consequential damages in their standard terms and conditions, the company's ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited as a result of differing factors, such as the inability to exclude such damages due to the laws of some of the countries where it does business.  The company's business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in the products sold by the company, if it is required to pay for the associated damages.  Although the company currently has product liability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage and amount. Further, when relying on contractual liability exclusions, the company could lose customers if their claims are not addressed to their satisfaction.  Declines in value and other factors pertaining to the company's inventory could materially adversely affect its business. The market for the company's products and services is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in end-market demand, oversupply of product, and regulatory requirements, which can contribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of inventory.  Although most of the company's suppliers provide the company with certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and certain rights of return), the company cannot be sure that such protections will fully compensate it for the loss in value, or that the suppliers will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements.  For example, many of the company's suppliers will not allow products to be returned after they have been held in inventory beyond a certain amount of time, and, in most instances, the return rights are limited to a certain percentage of the amount of product the company purchased in a particular time frame.  All of these factors pertaining to inventory could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.The company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could materially adversely affect its business. A number of jurisdictions in which the company's products are sold have enacted laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other related matters. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of the company's products and impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters.  Failure to comply with these laws or any other applicable environmental regulations could result in fines or suspension of sales.  Additionally, these directives and regulations may result in the company having non-compliant inventory that may be less readily salable or have to be written off.  Some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from the company's currently or formerly owned, leased, or operated property, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination.  As the distribution business, in general, does not involve the manufacture of products, it is typically not subject to significant liability in this area.  However, there may be occasions, including through acquisitions, where environmental liability arises. Two sites for which the company assumed responsibility as part of the Wyle Electronics (""Wyle"") acquisition are known to have environmental issues, one at Norco, California and the other at Huntsville, Alabama.  The company was also named as a defendant in a private lawsuit filed in connection with alleged contamination at a small industrial building formerly leased by Wyle Laboratories in El Segundo, California.  The lawsuit was settled, but the possibility remains that government entities or others may attempt to involve the company in further characterization or remediation of groundwater issues in the area.  The presence of environmental contamination could also interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect the company's ability to sell or lease its properties.  The discovery of contamination for which the company is responsible, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing requirements are enforced, could require the company to incur costs for compliance or subject it to unexpected liabilities.  8Expansion into the electronic asset disposition market has broadened the company's risk profile. The company has expanded into the electronics asset disposition business, pursuant to which it provides services related to electronic devices being disposed of by business customers. These services include, the cleansing of storage devices from customer equipment and either recycling it through resale or disposing of it in an environmentally compliant manner.  The company may also hold equipment in order to protect and preserve customer data.  If the company does not meet its contractual and regulatory obligations with respect to such data, it could be subject to financial damages, penalties, and damage to reputation.  Also, the company's or its subcontractors' failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations in disposing of the equipment could result in liability.  Such environmental liability may be joint and several, meaning that the company could be held responsible for more than its share of the liability involved.   To the extent that company fails to comply with its obligations and such failure is not covered by insurance, the company's business could be adversely affected.The company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources. The company requires cash or committed liquidity facilities for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital, acquisitions, and capital expenditure needs, as well as to refinance indebtedness.  At December 31, 2016, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $534.3 million.  In addition, the company currently has access to committed credit lines and an asset securitization program of $2.7 billion, of which the company had outstanding borrowings of $460.0 million at December 31, 2016. The company's ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond its control. The company may, in the future, need to access the financial markets to satisfy its cash needs.  The company's ability to obtain external financing is affected by various factors including general financial market conditions and the company's debt ratings.  Further, any increase in the company's level of debt, change in status of its debt from unsecured to secured debt, or deterioration of its operating results may cause a reduction in its current debt ratings. Any downgrade in the company's current debt rating or tightening of credit availability could impair the company's ability to obtain additional financing or renew existing credit facilities on acceptable terms.  Under the terms of any external financing, the company may incur higher financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants. For example, the company's existing debt agreements contain restrictive covenants, including covenants requiring compliance with specified financial ratios, and a failure to comply with these or any other covenants may result in an event of default.  The company's lack of access to cost-effective capital resources, an increase in the company's financing costs, or a breach of debt covenants could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. The agreements governing some of the company's financing arrangements contain various covenants and restrictions that limit some of management's discretion in operating the business and could prevent the company from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to its business.The agreements governing the company's financings contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, could limit its ability to:•grant liens on assets;•make investments;•merge, consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets;•incur additional debt; or•engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the company may be limited in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, compete effectively, or make investments.The company's failure to have long-term sales contracts may have a material adverse effect on its business.Most of the company's sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts.  The company generally works with its customers to develop non-binding forecasts for future orders.  Based on such non-binding forecasts, the company makes commitments regarding the level of business that it will seek and accept, the inventory that it purchases, and the levels of utilization of personnel and other resources.  A variety of conditions, both specific to each customer and generally affecting each customer's industry may cause customers to cancel, reduce, or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated, file for bankruptcy protection or fail, or default on their payments.  Generally, customers cancel, reduce, or delay purchase orders and commitments without penalty.  The company seeks to mitigate these risks, in some cases, by entering into noncancelable/nonreturnable sales agreements, but there is no guarantee that such agreements will adequately protect the company.  Significant 9or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays in orders by customers, loss of customers, and/or customer defaults on payments could materially adversely affect the company's business.The company's revenues originate primarily from the sales of semiconductor, PEMCO (passive, electro-mechanical and interconnect), IT hardware and software products, the sales of which are traditionally cyclical. The semiconductor industry historically has experienced fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity and subject to significant economic market upturns and downturns.  Sales of semiconductor products and related services represented approximately 42%, 41%, and 42% of the company's consolidated sales in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.  The sale of the company's PEMCO products closely tracks the semiconductor market.  Accordingly, the company's revenues and profitability, particularly in its global components business segment, tend to closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market.  Further, economic weakness could cause a decline in spending in information technology, which could have a negative impact on the company's ECS business. A cyclical downturn in the technology industry could have a material adverse effect on the company's business and negatively impact its ability to maintain historical profitability levels.The company's non-U.S. sales represent a significant portion of its revenues, and consequently, the company is exposed to risks associated with operating internationally. In 2016, 2015, and 2014, approximately 56%, 54%, and 54%, respectively, of the company's sales came from its operations outside the United States.  As a result of the company's international sales and locations, its operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following: •import and export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;•the burden and cost of compliance with international laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations; •potential restrictions on transfers of funds;•import and export duties and value-added taxes;•transportation delays and interruptions;•the burden and cost of compliance with complex multi-national tax laws and regulations;•uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations; •enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or similar laws of other jurisdictions;•foreign laws that potentially discriminate against companies which are headquartered outside that jurisdiction;•volatility associated with sovereign debt of certain international economies;•the uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effects of Brexit; •potential military conflicts and political risks; and•currency fluctuations, which the company attempts to minimize through traditional hedging instruments.Furthermore, products the company sells which are either manufactured in the United States or based on U.S. technology (""U.S. Products"") are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (""EAR"") when exported and re-exported to and from all international jurisdictions, in addition to the local jurisdiction's export regulations applicable to individual shipments.  Licenses or proper license exemptions may be required by local jurisdictions' export regulations, including EAR, for the shipment of certain U.S. Products to certain countries, including China, India, Russia, and other countries in which the company operates.  Non-compliance with the EAR or other applicable export regulations can result in a wide range of penalties including the denial of export privileges, fines, criminal penalties, and the seizure of inventories.  In the event that any export regulatory body determines that any shipments made by the company violate the applicable export regulations, the company could be fined significant sums and/or its export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.Also, the company's gross margins in the components business in the Asia/Pacific region tend to be lower than those in the other markets in which the company sells products and services.  If sales in this market increase as a percentage of overall sales, consolidated gross margins will be lower.  The financial impact of lower gross profit on returns on working capital is offset, in part, by lower working capital requirements.  While the company has and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business abroad, it cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on its business.Certain tax policy efforts, including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (""OECD"") Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (""BEPS"") Project, the European Commission’s state aid investigations, and other initiatives could have an adverse effect on the taxation of international businesses. Furthermore, many of the countries where we are subject to taxes, including the United States, are independently evaluating their tax policy and we may see significant changes in legislation and 10regulations concerning taxation. Certain countries have already enacted legislation which could affect international businesses, and other countries have become more aggressive in their approach to audits and enforcement of their applicable tax laws. Such changes, to the extent they are brought into tax legislation, regulations, policies, or practices, could increase our effective tax rates in many of the countries where we have operations and have an adverse effect on our overall tax rate, along with increasing the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance, all of which could impact our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.When the company makes acquisitions, it may take on additional liabilities or not be able to successfully integrate such acquisitions.As part of the company's history and growth strategy, it has acquired other businesses.  Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:•effectively combining the acquired operations, technologies, or products;•unanticipated costs or assumed liabilities, including those associated with regulatory actions or investigations;•not realizing the anticipated financial benefit from the acquired companies;•diversion of management's attention;•negative effects on existing customer and supplier relationships; and•potential loss of key employees, especially those of the acquired companies.Further, the company has made, and may continue to make acquisitions of, or investments in new services, businesses or technologies to expand its current service offerings and product lines.  Some of these may involve risks that may differ from those traditionally associated with the company's core distribution business, including undertaking product or service warranty responsibilities that in its traditional core business would generally reside primarily with its suppliers. If the company is not successful in mitigating or insuring against such risks, it could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.The company's goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of its assets and reduce its net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the assets acquired.  The company also ascribes value to certain identifiable intangible assets, which consist primarily of customer relationships and trade names, among others, as a result of acquisitions.  The company may incur impairment charges on goodwill or identifiable intangible assets if it determines that the fair values of the goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are less than their current carrying values.  The company evaluates, on a regular basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary.  Refer to Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and 'Critical Accounting Policies' in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion of the impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.  A decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations could impact the judgments and assumptions about the fair value of the company's businesses and the company could be required to record impairment charges on its goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the future, which could impact the company's consolidated balance sheet, as well as the company's consolidated statement of operations. If the company is required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the company's consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, or capital resources. If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discovers material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. An effective internal control environment is necessary for the company to produce reliable financial reports and is an important part of its effort to prevent financial fraud.  The company is required to annually evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal controls over financial reporting.  Based on these evaluations, the company may conclude that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable.  While management evaluates the effectiveness of the company's internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective.  There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment.  In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate financial statement risk.  If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or the company's independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in the company's internal controls, it may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or 11prevent fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.  In addition, the company may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or the NYSE.  Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the company's financial statements, which could cause the market price of its common stock to decline or limit the company's access to capital.Cyber security and privacy breaches may hurt the company’s business, damage its reputation, increase its costs, and cause losses.The company’s information technology systems could be subject to invasion, cyber-attack, or data privacy breaches by employees, others with authorized access, and unauthorized persons. Such attacks could result in disruption to the company’s operations, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, the company’s or any of its customer’s or supplier’s data or confidential information. The company’s information technology systems security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or suppliers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the company’s data and information technology systems. Any such breach could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to the company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, and a loss of confidence in the security of the company’s information technology systems that could potentially have an impact on the company’s business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade, or sabotage the company’s information technology systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched, the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.  Further, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services for the company’s operations, could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that the company procures from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including ""bugs"" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the company’s information technology systems. Although the company has developed systems and processes that are designed to protect information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach, such measures cannot provide absolute security. Such breaches, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in the company incurring costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, or taking other remedial steps. Also, global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. The company’s failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others.  Although the company has insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks, it may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and the company may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on its business.The company relies heavily on its internal information systems, which, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect the company's business. The company's current global operations reside on multiple technology platforms.  The size and complexity of the company's computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, and random attack.  Because many of the company's systems consist of a number of legacy, internally developed applications, it can be harder to upgrade and may be more difficult to adapt to commercially available software.   The company is in process of implementing a global enterprise resource planning (""ERP"") system to standardize its global components processes worldwide and adopt best-in-class capabilities. The conversion is substantially complete in the EMEA and Asia/Pacific regions, while the conversion in the Americas region is expected to be implemented in 2017. The company has committed significant resources to this new ERP system, which replaces multiple legacy systems of the company.  This conversion is extremely complex, in part, because of the wide range of processes and the multiple legacy systems that must be integrated globally.  The company is using a controlled project plan that it believes will provide for the adequate allocation of resources.  However, such a plan, or a divergence from it, may result in cost overruns, project delays, or business interruptions.  During the conversion process, the company may be limited in its ability to integrate any business that it may want to acquire.  Failure to properly or adequately address these issues could impact the company's ability to perform necessary business operations, which could materially adversely affect the company's business.The company may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees and could limit the company's ability to use certain technologies in the future.Certain of the company's products and services include intellectual property owned primarily by the company's third party suppliers and, to a lesser extent, the company itself.  Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the semiconductor/integrated circuit, software and some service industries.  From time to time, third parties (including certain 12companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent, copyright and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company's business.   In some cases, depending on the nature of the claim, the company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that the company is fully protected against such claims.  In addition, the company is exposed to potential liability for technology that it develops itself or combines multiple technologies of its suppliers for which it may have limited or no indemnification protections.  In any dispute involving products or services that incorporate intellectual property from multiple sources or is developed, licensed by the company, or obtained through acquisition, the company's customers could also become the targets of litigation.  The company is obligated in many instances to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the company sells are alleged to infringe any third party's intellectual property rights.  Any infringement claim brought against the company, regardless of the duration, outcome, or size of damage award, could:•result in substantial cost to the company;•divert management's attention and resources;•be time consuming to defend;•result in substantial damage awards; or•cause product shipment delays.Additionally, if an infringement claim is successful the company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.  The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase the company's operating expenses and harm the company's operating results and financial condition.  Also, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all.  The company may have to stop selling certain products or using technologies, which could affect the company's ability to compete effectively.    Compliance with government regulations regarding the use of ""conflict minerals"" may result in increased costs and risks to the company.  As part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the ""Act""), the SEC has promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, known as conflict minerals.  The disclosure rules were effective in May 2014.  The company must publicly disclose the process it took to determine whether it manufactures (as defined in the Act) any products that contain conflict minerals.  Customers typically rely on the company to provide critical data regarding the parts they purchase, including conflict mineral information.  The company's material sourcing is broad-based and multi-tiered, and it is not able to easily verify the origins for conflict minerals used in all of the products it sells.  The company has many suppliers and each provides conflict mineral information in a different manner, if at all.  Accordingly, because the supply chain is complex, the company may face reputational challenges if it is unable to sufficiently verify the origins of conflict minerals used in its products.  Additionally, customers may demand that the products they purchase be free of conflict minerals.  This may limit the number of suppliers that can provide products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or at competitive prices"
3,ARW,ARROW ELECTRONICS INC,2016-02-05,"Risk Factors
. Described below and throughout this report are certain risks that the company's management believes are applicable to the company's business and the industry in which it operates.  If any of the described events occur, the company's business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected.  When stated below that a risk may have a material adverse effect on the company's business, it means that such risk may have one or more of these effects.  There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known.  There are also risks within the economy, the industry, and the capital markets that could materially adversely affect the company, including those associated with an economic recession, inflation, a global economic slowdown, and those associated with customers' inability or refusal to pay for the products and services provided by the company. There are also risks associated with the occurrence of natural disasters such as tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods. These factors affect businesses generally, including the company's customers and suppliers and, as a result, are not discussed in detail below except to the extent such conditions could materially affect the company and its customers and suppliers in particular ways. Included below are some risks pertaining to specific government regulation, however, not all regulations applicable to the company or unanticipated regulation changes (such as changes in tax regulations in the various geographies we operate) have been described. The continuing expansion of government laws and regulations, some that may apply specifically to the company's industry and others to the market generally, as well as any actions taken by activist investors, could negatively impact the company's profitability.If the company is unable to maintain its relationships with its suppliers or if the suppliers materially change the terms of their existing agreements with the company, the company's business could be materially adversely affected. A substantial portion of the company's inventory is purchased from suppliers with which the company has entered into non-exclusive distribution agreements.  These agreements are typically cancelable on short notice (generally 30 to 90 days).  Certain parts of the company's business, such as the company's global ECS business, rely on a limited number of suppliers. To the extent that the company's significant suppliers reduce the amount of products they sell through distribution, are unwilling to continue to do business with the company, or are unable to continue to meet or significantly alter their obligations, the company's business could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, to the extent that the company's suppliers modify the terms of their contracts with the company, limit supplies due to capacity constraints, or other factors, there could be a material adverse effect on the company's business.The competitive pressures the company faces could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.The company operates in a highly competitive international environment. The company competes with other large multinational and national electronic components and enterprise computing solutions distributors, as well as numerous other smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on narrower markets, products, or particular sectors. The company also competes for customers with its suppliers. The size of the company's competitors vary across market sectors, as do the resources the company has allocated to the sectors in which it does business. Therefore, some of the company's competitors may have a more extensive customer and/or supplier base than the company in one or more of its market sectors. There is significant competition within each market sector and geography that creates pricing pressure and the need for constant attention to improve services. Other competitive factors include rapid technological changes, product availability, credit availability, speed of delivery, ability to tailor solutions to customer needs, quality and depth of product lines and training, as well as service and support provided by the distributor to the customer.  The Company also faces competition from companies entering or expanding into the logistics and product fulfillment, catalog distribution, and e-commerce supply chain services markets. As the company seeks to expand its business into new areas in order to stay competitive in the market, such as in the area of the ""Internet of Things,"" the company may encounter increased competition from its current and/or new competitors.  The company's failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could have a material adverse effect on its business.Products sold by the company may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against the company, which may have a material adverse effect on the company.  The company sells its components at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. As a result, the company may face claims for damages (such as consequential damages) that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits it receives from the components involved in the claims.  While the company typically has provisions in its supplier agreements that hold the supplier accountable for defective products, and the company and its suppliers generally exclude consequential damages in their standard terms and conditions, the company's ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited as a result of differing factors, such as the inability to exclude such damages due to the laws of some of the countries where it does business.  The company's business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in the products sold by the company, if it is required to pay for the associated damages.  Although the company 7currently has product liability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage and amount. Further, when relying on contractual liability exclusions, the company could lose customers if their claims are not addressed to their satisfaction.  Declines in value and other factors pertaining to the company's inventory could materially adversely affect its business. The market for the company's products and services is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in end-market demand, oversupply of product, and regulatory requirements, which can contribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of inventory.  Although most of the company's suppliers provide the company with certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and certain rights of return), the company cannot be sure that such protections will fully compensate it for the loss in value, or that the suppliers will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements.  For example, many of the company's suppliers will not allow products to be returned after they have been held in inventory beyond a certain amount of time, and, in most instances, the return rights are limited to a certain percentage of the amount of product the company purchased in a particular time frame.  All of these factors pertaining to inventory could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.The company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could materially adversely affect its business. A number of jurisdictions in which the company's products are sold have enacted laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other related matters. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of the company's products and impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters.  Failure to comply with these laws or any other applicable environmental regulations could result in fines or suspension of sales.  Additionally, these directives and regulations may result in the company having non-compliant inventory that may be less readily salable or have to be written off.  Some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from the company's currently or formerly owned, leased, or operated property, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination.  As the distribution business, in general, does not involve the manufacture of products, it is typically not subject to significant liability in this area.  However, there may be occasions, including through acquisitions, where environmental liability arises. Two sites for which the company assumed responsibility as part of the Wyle Electronics (""Wyle"") acquisition are known to have environmental issues, one at Norco, California and the other at Huntsville, Alabama.  The company was also named as a defendant in a private lawsuit filed in connection with alleged contamination at a small industrial building formerly leased by Wyle Laboratories in El Segundo, California.  The lawsuit was settled, but the possibility remains that government entities or others may attempt to involve the company in further characterization or remediation of groundwater issues in the area.  The presence of environmental contamination could also interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect the company's ability to sell or lease its properties.  The discovery of contamination for which the company is responsible, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing requirements are enforced, could require the company to incur costs for compliance or subject it to unexpected liabilities.  Expansion into the electronic asset disposition market has broadened the company's risk profile. The company has expanded into the electronics asset disposition business, pursuant to which it provides services related to electronic devices being disposed of by business customers. These services include, the cleansing of storage devices from customer equipment and either recycling it through resale or disposing of it in an environmentally compliant manner.  The company may also hold equipment in order to protect and preserve customer data.  If the company does not meet its contractual and regulatory obligations with respect to such data, it could be subject to financial damages, penalties, and damage to reputation.  Also, the company's or its subcontractors' failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations in disposing of the equipment could result in liability.  Such environmental liability may be joint and several, meaning that the company could be held responsible for more than its share of the liability involved.   To the extent that company fails to comply with its obligations and such failure is not covered by insurance, the company's business could be adversely affected.The company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources. The company requires cash or committed liquidity facilities for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital, acquisition, and capital expenditure needs, as well as to refinance indebtedness.  At December 31, 2015, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $273.1 million.  In addition, the company currently has access to committed credit lines and an asset securitization program  of $2.4 billion, of which the company had outstanding borrowings of $147.0 million at December 31, 2015. The company's ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the 8financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond its control. The company may, in the future, need to access the financial markets to satisfy its cash needs.  The company's ability to obtain external financing is affected by various factors including general financial market conditions and the company's debt ratings.  Further, any increase in the company's level of debt, change in status of its debt from unsecured to secured debt, or deterioration of its operating results may cause a reduction in its current debt ratings. Any downgrade in the company's current debt rating or tightening of credit availability could impair the company's ability to obtain additional financing or renew existing credit facilities on acceptable terms.  Under the terms of any external financing, the company may incur higher financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants. For example, the company's existing debt agreements contain restrictive covenants, including covenants requiring compliance with specified financial ratios, and a failure to comply with these or any other covenants may result in an event of default.  The company's lack of access to cost-effective capital resources, an increase in the company's financing costs, or a breach of debt covenants could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. The agreements governing some of the company's financing arrangements contain various covenants and restrictions that limit some of management's discretion in operating the business and could prevent the company from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to its business.The agreements governing the company's financings contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, could limit its ability to:•grant liens on assets;•make investments;•merge, consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets;•incur additional debt; or•engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the company may be limited in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, compete effectively, or make investments.The company's failure to have long-term sales contracts may have a material adverse effect on its business.Most of the company's sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts.  The company generally works with its customers to develop non-binding forecasts for future orders.  Based on such non-binding forecasts, the company makes commitments regarding the level of business that it will seek and accept, the inventory that it purchases, and the levels of utilization of personnel and other resources.  A variety of conditions, both specific to each customer and generally affecting each customer's industry may cause customers to cancel, reduce, or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated, file for bankruptcy protection or fail, or default on their payments.  Generally, customers cancel, reduce, or delay purchase orders and commitments without penalty.  The company seeks to mitigate these risks, in some cases, by entering into noncancelable/nonreturnable sales agreements, but there is no guarantee that such agreements will adequately protect the company.  Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays in orders by customers, loss of customers, and/or customer defaults on payments could materially adversely affect the company's business.The company's revenues originate primarily from the sales of semiconductor, PEMCO (passive, electro-mechanical and interconnect), IT hardware and software products, the sales of which are traditionally cyclical. The semiconductor industry historically has experienced fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity and subject to significant economic market upturns and downturns.  Sales of semiconductor products and related services represented approximately 41%, 42%, and 41% of the company's consolidated sales in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.  The sale of the company's PEMCO products closely tracks the semiconductor market.  Accordingly, the company's revenues and profitability, particularly in its global components business segment, tend to closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market.  Further, economic weakness could cause a decline in spending in information technology, which could have a negative impact on the company's ECS business. A cyclical downturn in the technology industry could have a material adverse effect on the company's business and negatively impact its ability to maintain historical profitability levels.9The company's non-U.S. sales represent a significant portion of its revenues, and consequently, the company is exposed to risks associated with operating internationally. In 2015, 2014, and 2013, approximately 54%, 54%, and 53%, respectively, of the company's sales came from its operations outside the United States.  As a result of the company's international sales and locations, its operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following: •import and export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;•the burden and cost of compliance with international laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations; •potential restrictions on transfers of funds;•import and export duties and value-added taxes;•transportation delays and interruptions;•the burden and cost of compliance with complex multi-national tax laws and regulations;•uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations; •enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or similar laws of other jurisdictions;•foreign laws that potentially discriminate against companies which are headquartered outside that jurisdiction;•volatility associated with sovereign debt of certain international economies;•potential military conflicts and political risks; and•currency fluctuations, which the company attempts to minimize through traditional hedging instruments.Furthermore, products the company sells which are either manufactured in the United States or based on U.S. technology (""U.S. Products"") are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (""EAR"") when exported and re-exported to and from all international jurisdictions, in addition to the local jurisdiction's export regulations applicable to individual shipments.  Licenses or proper license exemptions may be required by local jurisdictions' export regulations, including EAR, for the shipment of certain U.S. Products to certain countries, including China, India, Russia, and other countries in which the company operates.  Non-compliance with the EAR or other applicable export regulations can result in a wide range of penalties including the denial of export privileges, fines, criminal penalties, and the seizure of inventories.  In the event that any export regulatory body determines that any shipments made by the company violate the applicable export regulations, the company could be fined significant sums and/or its export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.Also, the company's operating income margins in the components business in the Asia/Pacific region tend to be lower than those in the other markets in which the company sells products and services.  If sales in this market increased as a percentage of overall sales, consolidated operating income margins will be lower.  The financial impact of lower operating income on returns on working capital is offset, in part, by lower working capital requirements.  While the company has and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business abroad, it cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on its business.When the company makes acquisitions, it may take on additional liabilities or not be able to successfully integrate such acquisitions.As part of the company's history and growth strategy, it has acquired other businesses.  Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:•effectively combining the acquired operations, technologies, or products;•unanticipated costs or assumed liabilities, including those associated with regulatory actions or investigations;•not realizing the anticipated financial benefit from the acquired companies;•diversion of management's attention;•negative effects on existing customer and supplier relationships; and•potential loss of key employees, especially those of the acquired companies.Further, the company has made, and may continue to make acquisitions of, or investments in new services, businesses or technologies to expand its current service offerings and product lines.  Some of these may involve risks that may differ from those traditionally associated with the company's core distribution business, including undertaking product or service warranty responsibilities that in its traditional core business would generally reside primarily with its suppliers. If the company is not successful in mitigating or insuring against such risks, it could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.10The company's goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of its assets and reduce its net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the assets acquired.  The company also ascribes value to certain identifiable intangible assets, which consist primarily of customer relationships and trade names, among others, as a result of acquisitions.  The company may incur impairment charges on goodwill or identifiable intangible assets if it determines that the fair values of the goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are less than their current carrying values.  The company evaluates, on a regular basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary.  Refer to Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and 'Critical Accounting Policies' in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion of the impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.  A decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations could impact the judgments and assumptions about the fair value of the company's businesses and the company could be required to record impairment charges on its goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the future, which could impact the company's consolidated balance sheet, as well as the company's consolidated statement of operations. If the company is required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the company's consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, or capital resources. If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discovers material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. An effective internal control environment is necessary for the company to produce reliable financial reports and is an important part of its effort to prevent financial fraud.  The company is required to annually evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal controls over financial reporting.  Based on these evaluations, the company may conclude that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable.  While management evaluates the effectiveness of the company's internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective.  There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment.  In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate financial statement risk.  If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or the company's independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in the company's internal controls, it may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.  In addition, the company may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or the NYSE.  Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the company's financial statements, which could cause the market price of its common stock to decline or limit the company's access to capital.Cyber security and privacy breaches may hurt the company’s business, damage its reputation, increase its costs, and cause losses.The company’s information technology systems could be subject to invasion, cyber-attack, or data privacy breaches by employees, others with authorized access, and unauthorized persons. Such attacks could result in disruption to the company’s operations, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, the company’s or any of its customer’s or supplier’s data or confidential information. The company’s information technology systems security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or suppliers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the company’s data and information technology systems. Any such breach could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to the company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, and a loss of confidence in the security of the company’s information technology systems that could potentially have an impact on the company’s business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade, or sabotage the company’s information technology systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched, the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.  Further, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services for the company’s operations, could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that the company procures from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including ""bugs"" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the company’s information technology systems. Although the company has developed systems and processes that are designed to protect information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed 11to reduce the impact of a security breach, such measures cannot provide absolute security. Such breaches, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in the company incurring costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, or taking other remedial steps. Also, global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. The company’s failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others.  Although the company has insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks, it may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and the company may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on its business.The company relies heavily on its internal information systems, which, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect the company's business. The company's current global operations reside on multiple technology platforms.  The size and complexity of the company's computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, and random attack.  Because many of the company's systems consist of a number of legacy, internally developed applications, it can be harder to upgrade and may be more difficult to adapt to commercially available software.   The company is in process of implementing a global enterprise resource planning (""ERP"") system to standardize its global components processes worldwide and adopt best-in-class capabilities. The conversion is substantially complete in the EMEA and Asia/Pacific regions, while the conversion in the Americas region is expected to be implemented over the next few years. The company has committed significant resources to this new ERP system, which replaces multiple legacy systems of the company.  This conversion is extremely complex, in part, because of the wide range of processes and the multiple legacy systems that must be integrated globally.  The company is using a controlled project plan that it believes will provide for the adequate allocation of resources.  However, such a plan, or a divergence from it, may result in cost overruns, project delays, or business interruptions.  During the conversion process, the company may be limited in its ability to integrate any business that it may want to acquire.  Failure to properly or adequately address these issues could impact the company's ability to perform necessary business operations, which could materially adversely affect the company's business.The company may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees and could limit the company's ability to use certain technologies in the future.Certain of the company's products and services include intellectual property owned primarily by the company's third party suppliers and, to a lesser extent, the company itself.  Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the semiconductor/integrated circuit, software and some service industries.  From time to time, third parties (including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent, copyright and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company's business.   In some cases, depending on the nature of the claim, the company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that the company is fully protected against such claims.  In addition, the company is exposed to potential liability for technology that it develops itself for which it has no indemnification protections.  In any dispute involving products or services that incorporate intellectual property developed, licensed by the company, or obtained through acquisition, the company's customers could also become the target of litigation.  The company is obligated in many instances to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the company sells are alleged to infringe any third party's intellectual property rights.  Any infringement claim brought against the company, regardless of the duration, outcome, or size of damage award, could:•result in substantial cost to the company;•divert management's attention and resources;•be time consuming to defend;•result in substantial damage awards; or•cause product shipment delays.Additionally, if an infringement claim is successful the company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.  The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase the company's operating expenses and harm the company's operating results and financial condition.  Also, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all.  The company may have to stop selling certain products or using technologies, which could affect the company's ability to compete effectively.    12The company may not be able to adequately anticipate, prevent or mitigate damage resulting from criminal and other illegal or fraudulent activities committed against it.Global businesses like ours are facing increasing risks of criminal, illegal and other fraudulent acts.  The evolving nature of such threats, in light of new and sophisticated methods used by criminals, including phishing, social engineering and forgery, are making it increasingly difficult for us to anticipate and adequately mitigate these risks. Although management believes internal controls are adequate to timely detect unauthorized cash disbursements so as to prevent a material misstatement of the company’s financial statements, these controls may not be adequate to safeguard the company’s cash assets from unauthorized transfers resulting from human error. In addition, designing and implementing measures to defend against, prevent and detect these types of activities are increasingly costly and invasive into the operations of the business.  As a result, we could experience a material loss in the future to the extent that controls and other measures we implement to address these threats fail to prevent or detect such acts.Compliance with government regulations regarding the use of ""conflict minerals"" may result in increased costs and risks to the company.  As part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the ""Act""), the SEC has promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, known as conflict minerals.  The disclosure rules were effective in May 2014.  The company must publicly disclose the process it took to determine whether it manufactures (as defined in the Act) any products that contain conflict minerals.  Customers typically rely on the company to provide critical data regarding the parts they purchase, including conflict mineral information.  The company's material sourcing is broad-based and multi-tiered, and it is not able to easily verify the origins for conflict minerals used in all of the products it sells.  The company has many suppliers and each provides conflict mineral information in a different manner, if at all.  Accordingly, because the supply chain is complex, the company may face reputational challenges if it is unable to sufficiently verify the origins of conflict minerals used in its products.  Additionally, customers may demand that the products they purchase be free of conflict minerals.  This may limit the number of suppliers that can provide products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or at competitive prices"
11,ARW,ARROW ELECTRONICS INC,2015-02-05,"Risk Factors
.Described below and throughout this report are certain risks that the company's management believes are applicable to the company's business and the industry in which it operates.  If any of the described events occur, the company's business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected.  When stated below that a risk may have a material adverse effect on the company's business, it means that such risk may have one or more of these effects.  There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known.  There are also risks within the economy, the industry, and the capital markets that could materially adversely affect the company, including those associated with an economic recession, inflation, a global economic slowdown, and those associated with customers' inability or refusal to pay for the products and services provided by the company. There are also risks associated with the occurrence of natural disasters such as tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods. These factors affect businesses generally, including the company's customers and suppliers and, as a result, are not discussed in detail below except to the extent such conditions could materially affect the company and its customers and suppliers in particular ways. Included below are some risks pertaining to specific government regulation, however, not all regulations applicable to the company or unanticipated regulation changes (such as changes in tax regulations in the various geographies we operate) have been described. The continuing expansion of government laws and regulations, some that may apply specifically to the company's industry and others to the market generally, could negatively impact the company's profitability.If the company is unable to maintain its relationships with its suppliers or if the suppliers materially change the terms of their existing agreements with the company, the company's business could be materially adversely affected. A substantial portion of the company's inventory is purchased from suppliers with which the company has entered into non-exclusive distribution agreements.  These agreements are typically cancelable on short notice (generally 30 to 90 days).  Certain parts of the company's business, such as the company's global ECS business, rely on a limited number of suppliers. To the extent that the company's significant suppliers reduce the amount of products they sell through distribution, are unwilling to continue to do business with the company, or are unable to continue to meet or significantly alter their obligations, the company's business could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, to the extent that the company's suppliers modify the terms of their contracts with the company, limit supplies due to capacity constraints, or other factors, there could be a material adverse effect on the company's business.The competitive pressures the company faces could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.The company operates in a highly competitive environment, both in the United States and internationally. The company competes with other large multinational and national electronic components and enterprise computing solutions distributors, as well as numerous other smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on narrower markets, products, or particular sectors. The company also competes for customers with its suppliers. The size of the company's competitors vary across market sectors, as do the resources the company has allocated to the sectors in which it does business. Therefore, some of the company's competitors may have a more extensive customer and/or supplier base than the company in one or more of its market sectors. There is significant competition within each market sector and geography that creates pricing pressure and the need for constant attention to improve services. Other competitive factors include rapid technological changes, product availability, credit availability, speed of delivery, ability to tailor solutions to customer needs, quality and depth of product lines and training, as well as service and support provided by the distributor to the customer.  The Company also faces competition from companies entering or expanding into the logistics and product fulfillment, catalog distribution, and e-commerce supply chain services markets. As the company seeks to expand its business into new areas in order to stay competitive in the market, the company may encounter increased competition from its current and/or new competitors.  The company's failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could have a material adverse effect on its business.Products sold by the company may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against the company, which may have a material adverse effect on the company.  The company sells its components at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. As a result, the company may face claims for damages (such as consequential damages) that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits it receives from the components involved in the claims.  While the company typically has provisions in its supplier agreements that hold the supplier accountable for defective products, and the company and its suppliers generally exclude consequential damages in their standard terms and conditions, the company's ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited as a result of differing factors, such as the inability to exclude such damages due to the laws of some of the countries where it does business.  The company's business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in the products sold by the company, if it is required to pay for the associated damages.  Although the company currently has product liability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage and amount.  8Declines in value and other factors pertaining to the company's inventory could materially adversely affect its business. The market for the company's products and services is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in end-market demand, oversupply of product, and regulatory requirements, which can contribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of inventory.  Although most of the company's suppliers provide the company with certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and certain rights of return), the company cannot be sure that such protections will fully compensate it for the loss in value, or that the suppliers will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements.  For example, many of the company's suppliers will not allow products to be returned after they have been held in inventory beyond a certain amount of time, and, in most instances, the return rights are limited to a certain percentage of the amount of product the company purchased in a particular time frame.  All of these factors pertaining to inventory could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.The company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could materially adversely affect its business. The European Union, China, and other jurisdictions in which the company's products are sold have enacted laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other related matters. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of the company's products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters.  Failure to comply with these laws or any other applicable environmental regulations could result in fines or suspension of sales.  Additionally, these directives and regulations may result in the company having non-compliant inventory that may be less readily salable or have to be written off.  Some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from the company's currently or formerly owned, leased, or operated property, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination.  As the distribution business, in general, does not involve the manufacture of products, it is typically not subject to significant liability in this area.  However, there may be occasions, including through acquisitions, where environmental liability arises. Two sites for which the company assumed responsibility as part of the Wyle Electronics  (""Wyle"") acquisition are known to have environmental issues, one at Norco, California and the other at Huntsville, Alabama.  The company was also named as a defendant in a private lawsuit filed in connection with alleged contamination at a small industrial building formerly leased by Wyle Laboratories in El Segundo, California.  The lawsuit was settled, but the possibility remains that government entities or others may attempt to involve the company in further characterization or remediation of groundwater issues in the area.  The presence of environmental contamination could also interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect the company's ability to sell or lease its properties.  The discovery of contamination for which the company is responsible, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing requirements are enforced, could require the company to incur costs for compliance or subject it to unexpected liabilities.  The foregoing matters could materially adversely affect the company's business.Expansion into the electronic asset disposition market has broadened the company's risk profile. The company has expanded into the electronics asset disposition business, pursuant to which it provides services related to electronic devices being disposed of by business customers,  including cleansing storage devices from customer equipment and either recycling it through resale or disposing of it in an environmentally compliant manner.  The company may also hold equipment in order to protect and preserve customer data.  If the company does not meet its contractual and regulatory obligations with respect to such data, it could be subject to contractual damages, penalties, and damage to reputation.  Also, the company's or its subcontractors' failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations in disposing of the equipment could result in liability.  Such environmental liability may be joint and several, meaning that the company could be held responsible for more than its share of the liability involved.   To the extent that company fails to comply with its obligations and such failure is not covered by insurance, the company's business could be adversely affected.The company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources. The company requires cash or committed liquidity facilities for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital, acquisition, and capital expenditure needs, as well as to refinance indebtedness.  At December 31, 2014, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $400.4 million.  In addition, the company currently has access to committed credit lines of $2.40 billion, of which the company had outstanding borrowings of $275.0 million at December 31, 2014. The company's ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond its control. 9The company may, in the future, need to access the financial markets to satisfy its cash needs.  The company's ability to obtain external financing is affected by various factors including general financial market conditions and the company's debt ratings.  Further, any increase in the company's level of debt, change in status of its debt from unsecured to secured debt, or deterioration of its operating results may cause a reduction in its current debt ratings. Any downgrade in the company's current debt rating or tightening of credit availability could impair the company's ability to obtain additional financing or renew existing credit facilities on acceptable terms.  Under the terms of any external financing, the company may incur higher financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants. For example, the company's existing debt agreements contain restrictive covenants, including covenants requiring compliance with specified financial ratios, and a failure to comply with these or any other covenants may result in an event of default.  The company's lack of access to cost-effective capital resources, an increase in the company's financing costs, or a breach of debt covenants could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. The agreements governing some of the company's financing arrangements contain various covenants and restrictions that limit some of management's discretion in operating the business and could prevent the company from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to its business.The agreements governing the company's financings contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, could limit its ability to:•grant liens on assets;•make investments;•merge, consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets;•incur additional debt; or•engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the company may be limited in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, compete effectively, or make investments.The company's failure to have long-term sales contracts may have a material adverse effect on its business.Most of the company's sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts.  The company generally works with its customers to develop non-binding forecasts for future orders.  Based on such non-binding forecasts, the company makes commitments regarding the level of business that it will seek and accept, the inventory that it purchases, and the levels of utilization of personnel and other resources.  A variety of conditions, both specific to each customer and generally affecting each customer's industry may cause customers to cancel, reduce, or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated, file for bankruptcy protection or fail, or default on their payments.  Generally, customers cancel, reduce, or delay purchase orders and commitments without penalty.  The company seeks to mitigate these risks, in some cases, by entering into noncancelable/nonreturnable sales agreements, but there is no guarantee that such agreements will adequately protect the company.  Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays in orders by customers, loss of customers, and/or customer defaults on payments could materially adversely affect the company's business.The company's revenues originate primarily from the sales of semiconductor, PEMCO (passive, electro-mechanical and interconnect), IT hardware and software products, the sales of which are traditionally cyclical. The semiconductor industry historically has experienced fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity and subject to significant economic market upturns and downturns.  Sales of semiconductor products and related services represented approximately 42%, 41%, and 43% of the company's consolidated sales in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.  The sale of the company's PEMCO products closely tracks the semiconductor market.  Accordingly, the company's revenues and profitability, particularly in its global components business segment, tend to closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market.  Further, economic weakness could cause a decline in spending in information technology, which could have a negative impact on the company's ECS business. A cyclical downturn in the technology industry could have a material adverse effect on the company's business and negatively impact its ability to maintain historical profitability levels.10The company's non-U.S. sales represent a significant portion of its revenues, and consequently, the company is exposed to risks associated with operating internationally. In 2014, 2013, and 2012, approximately 54%, 53%, and 52%, respectively, of the company's sales came from its operations outside the United States.  As a result of the company's international sales and locations, its operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following: •import and export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;•the burden and cost of compliance with international laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations; •potential restrictions on transfers of funds;•import and export duties and value-added taxes;•transportation delays and interruptions;•the burden and cost of compliance with complex multi-national tax laws and regulations;•uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations; •enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or similar laws of other jurisdictions;•foreign laws that potentially discriminate against companies which are headquartered outside that jurisdiction;•volatility associated with sovereign debt of certain international economies;•potential military conflicts and political risks; and•currency fluctuations, which the company attempts to minimize through traditional hedging instruments.Furthermore, products the company sells which are either manufactured in the United States or based on U.S. technology (""U.S. Products"") are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (""EAR"") when exported and re-exported to and from all international jurisdictions, in addition to the local jurisdiction's export regulations applicable to individual shipments.  Licenses or proper license exemptions may be required by local jurisdictions' export regulations, including EAR, for the shipment of certain U.S. Products to certain countries, including China, India, Russia, and other countries in which the company operates.  Non-compliance with the EAR or other applicable export regulations can result in a wide range of penalties including the denial of export privileges, fines, criminal penalties, and the seizure of inventories.  In the event that any export regulatory body determines that any shipments made by the company violate the applicable export regulations, the company could be fined significant sums and/or its export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.Also, the company's operating income margins in the components business in the Asia/Pacific region tend to be lower than those in the other markets in which the company sells products and services.  If sales in this market increased as a percentage of overall sales, consolidated operating income margins will be lower.  The financial impact of lower operating income on returns on working capital is offset, in part, by lower working capital requirements.  While the company has and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business abroad, it cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on its business.When the company makes acquisitions, it may take on additional liabilities or not be able to successfully integrate such acquisitions.As part of the company's history and growth strategy, it has acquired other businesses.  Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:•effectively combining the acquired operations, technologies, or products;•unanticipated costs or assumed liabilities, including those associated with regulatory actions or investigations;•not realizing the anticipated financial benefit from the acquired companies;•diversion of management's attention;•negative effects on existing customer and supplier relationships; and•potential loss of key employees, especially those of the acquired companies.Further, the company has made, and may continue to make acquisitions of, or investments in new services, businesses or technologies to expand its current service offerings and product lines.  Some of these may involve risks that may differ from those traditionally associated with the company's core distribution business, including undertaking product or service warranty responsibilities that in its traditional core business would generally reside primarily with its suppliers. If the company is not successful in mitigating or insuring against such risks, it could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.11The company's goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of its assets and reduce its net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the assets acquired.  The company also ascribes value to certain identifiable intangible assets, which consist primarily of customer relationships and trade names, among others, as a result of acquisitions.  The company may incur impairment charges on goodwill or identifiable intangible assets if it determines that the fair values of the goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are less than their current carrying values.  The company evaluates, on a regular basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary.  Refer to Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and 'Critical Accounting Policies' in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion of the impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.  A decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations could impact the judgments and assumptions about the fair value of the company's businesses and the company could be required to record impairment charges on its goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the future, which could impact the company's consolidated balance sheet, as well as the company's consolidated statement of operations. If the company is required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the company's consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, or capital resources. If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discovers material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. An effective internal control environment is necessary for the company to produce reliable financial reports and is an important part of its effort to prevent financial fraud.  The company is required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal controls over financial reporting.  Based on these evaluations, the company may conclude that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable.  While management evaluates the effectiveness of the company's internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective.  There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment.  In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate financial statement risk.  If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or the company's independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in the company's internal controls, it may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.  In addition, the company may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or the NYSE.  Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the company's financial statements, which could cause the market price of its common stock to decline or limit the company's access to capital.Cyber security and privacy breaches may hurt the company’s business, damage its reputation, increase its costs, and cause losses.The company’s information technology systems could be subject to invasion, cyber-attack, or data privacy breaches by employees, others with authorized access, and unauthorized persons. Such attacks could result in disruption to the company’s  operations, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, the company’s or any of its customer’s or supplier’s data or confidential information. The company’s information technology systems security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or suppliers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the company’s data and information technology systems. Any such breach could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to the company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, and a loss of confidence in the security of the company’s information technology systems that could potentially have an impact on the company’s business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade, or sabotage the company’s information technology systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched, the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.  Further, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services for the company’s operations, could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that the company procures from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including ""bugs"" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the company’s information technology systems. Although the company has developed systems and processes that are designed to protect information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach, such measures cannot provide absolute security. Such breaches, whether successful or 12unsuccessful, could result in the company incurring costs related to, for example, rebuilding internal systems, defending against litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, or taking other remedial steps. Also, global privacy legislation, enforcement, and policy activity are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. The company’s failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others.  Although the company has insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks, it may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and the company may suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on its business.The company relies heavily on its internal information systems, which, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect the company's business. The company's current global operations reside on multiple technology platforms.  The size and complexity of the company's computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, and random attack.  Because many of the company's systems consist of a number of legacy, internally developed applications, it can be harder to upgrade and may be more difficult to adapt to commercially available software.   The company is in process of implementing a global enterprise resource planning (""ERP"") system to standardize its global components processes worldwide and adopt best-in-class capabilities. The conversion is substantially complete in the EMEA and Asia/Pacific regions, while the conversion in the Americas region is expected to be implemented over the next few years. The company has committed significant resources to this new ERP system, which replaces multiple legacy systems of the company.  This conversion is extremely complex, in part, because of the wide range of processes and the multiple legacy systems that must be integrated globally.  The company is using a controlled project plan that it believes will provide for the adequate allocation of resources.  However, such a plan, or a divergence from it, may result in cost overruns, project delays, or business interruptions.  During the conversion process, the company may be limited in its ability to integrate any business that it may want to acquire.  Failure to properly or adequately address these issues could impact the company's ability to perform necessary business operations, which could materially adversely affect the company's business.The company may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees and could limit the company's ability to use certain technologies in the future.Certain of the company's products and services include intellectual property owned primarily by the company's third party suppliers and, to a lesser extent, the company itself.  Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the semiconductor/integrated circuit, software and some service industries.  From time to time, third parties (including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent, copyright and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company's business.   In some cases, depending on the nature of the claim, the company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that the company is fully protected against such claims.  In addition, the company is exposed to potential liability for technology that it develops itself for which it has no indemnification protections.  In any dispute involving products or services that incorporate intellectual property developed, licensed by the company, or obtained through acquisition, the company's customers could also become the target of litigation.  The company is obligated in many instances to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the company sells are alleged to infringe any third party's intellectual property rights.  Any infringement claim brought against the company, regardless of the duration, outcome, or size of damage award, could:•result in substantial cost to the company;•divert management's attention and resources;•be time consuming to defend;•result in substantial damage awards; or•cause product shipment delays.Additionally, if an infringement claim is successful the company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.  The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase the company's operating expenses and harm the company's operating results and financial condition.  Also, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all.  The company may have to stop selling certain products or using technologies, which could affect the company's ability to compete effectively.    13Compliance with government regulations regarding the use of ""conflict minerals"" may result in increased costs and risks to the company.  As part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the ""Act""), the SEC has promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, known as conflict minerals.  The disclosure rules were effective in May 2014.  The company will have to publicly disclose whether it manufactures (as defined in the Act) any products that contain conflict minerals and could incur significant costs related to implementing a process that will meet the mandates of the Act.  Additionally, customers typically rely on the company to provide critical data regarding the parts they purchase, including conflict mineral information.  The company's material sourcing is broad-based and multi-tiered, and it may not be able to easily verify the origins for conflict minerals used in the products it sells.  The company has many suppliers and each provides conflict mineral information in a different manner, if at all.  Accordingly, because the supply chain is complex, the company may face reputational challenges if it is unable to sufficiently verify the origins of conflict minerals used in its products.  Additionally, customers may demand that the products they purchase be free of conflict minerals.  This may limit the number of suppliers that can provide products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or at competitive prices"

.Described below and throughout this report are certain risks that the company's management believes are applicable to the company's business and the industry in which it operates.  If any of the described events occur, the company's business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected.  When stated below that a risk may have a material adverse effect on the company's business, it means that such risk may have one or more of these effects.  There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known.  There are also risks within the economy, the industry, and the capital markets that could materially adversely affect the company, including those associated with an economic recession, inflation, and a global economic slowdown.  There are also risks associated with the occurrence of natural disasters such as tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods. These factors affect businesses generally, including the company's customers and suppliers and, as a result, are not discussed in detail below except to the extent such conditions could materially affect the company and its customers and suppliers in particular ways. If the company is unable to maintain its relationships with its suppliers or if the suppliers materially change the terms of their existing agreements with the company, the company's business could be materially adversely affected. A substantial portion of the company's inventory is purchased from suppliers with which the company has entered into non-exclusive distribution agreements.  These agreements are typically cancelable on short notice (generally 30 to 90 days).  Certain parts of the company's business, such as the company's global ECS business, rely on a limited number of suppliers. To the extent that the company's significant suppliers reduce the amount of products they sell through distribution, are unwilling to continue to do business with the company, or are unable to continue to meet or significantly alter their obligations, the company's business could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, to the extent that the company's suppliers modify the terms of their contracts with the company, limit supplies due to capacity constraints, or other factors, there could be a material adverse effect on the company's business.The competitive pressures the company faces could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.The company operates in a highly competitive environment, both in the United States and internationally. The company competes with other large multinational and national electronic components and enterprise computing solutions distributors, as well as numerous other smaller, specialized competitors who generally focus on narrower markets, products, or particular sectors. The company also competes for customers with its suppliers. The size of the company's competitors vary across markets sectors, as do the resources the company has allocated to the sectors in which it does business. Therefore, some of the company's competitors may have a more extensive customer and/or supplier base than the company in one or more of its market sectors. There is significant competition within each market sector and geography that creates pricing pressure and the need for constant attention to improve services. Other competitive factors include rapid technological changes, product availability, credit availability, speed of delivery, ability to tailor solutions to customer needs, quality and depth of product lines and training, as well as service and support provided by the distributor to the customer.  The Company also faces competition from companies entering or expanding into the logistics and product fulfillment, catalog distribution, and e-commerce supply chain services markets. As the company seeks to expand its business into new areas in order to stay competitive in the market, the company may encounter increased competition from its current and/or new competitors.  The company's failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could have a material adverse effect on its business.Products sold by the company may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against the company, which may have a material adverse effect on the company.  The company sells its components at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated.  As a result, the company may face claims for damages (such as consequential damages) that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits it receives from the components involved in the claims.  While the company typically has provisions in its supplier agreements that hold the supplier accountable for defective products, and the company and its suppliers generally exclude consequential damages in their standard terms and conditions, the company's ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited as a result of differing factors, such as the inability to exclude such damages due to the laws of some of the countries where it does business.  The company's business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in the products sold by the company, if it is required to pay for the associated damages.  Although the company currently has product liability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage and amount.  Declines in value and other factors pertaining to the company's inventory could materially adversely affect its business. The market for the company's products and services is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in end-market demand, oversupply of product, and regulatory requirements, which can contribute to the decline in value or 8obsolescence of inventory.  Although most of the company's suppliers provide the company with certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and certain rights of return), the company cannot be sure that such protections will fully compensate it for the loss in value, or that the suppliers will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements.  For example, many of the company's suppliers will not allow products to be returned after they have been held in inventory beyond a certain amount of time, and, in most instances, the return rights are limited to a certain percentage of the amount of product the company purchased in a particular time frame.  All of these factors pertaining to inventory could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.The company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could materially adversely affect its business. The European Union, China, and other jurisdictions in which the company's products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other related matters. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of the company's products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters.  Failure to comply with these laws or any other applicable environmental regulations could result in fines or suspension of sales.  Additionally, these directives and regulations may result in the company having non-compliant inventory that may be less readily salable or have to be written off.  Some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from the company's currently or formerly owned, leased, or operated property, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination.  As the distribution business, in general, does not involve the manufacture of products, it is typically not subject to significant liability in this area.  However, there may be occasions, including through acquisitions, where environmental liability arises. Two sites for which the company assumed responsibility as part of the Wyle Electronics (""Wyle"") acquisition are known to have environmental issues, one at Norco, California and the other at Huntsville, Alabama.  The company was also named as a defendant in a private lawsuit filed in connection with alleged contamination at a small industrial building formerly leased by Wyle Laboratories in El Segundo, California.  The lawsuit was settled, but the possibility remains that government entities or others may attempt to involve the company in further characterization or remediation of groundwater issues in the area.  The presence of environmental contamination could also interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect the company's ability to sell or lease its properties.  The discovery of contamination for which the company is responsible, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing requirements are enforced, could require the company to incur costs for compliance or subject it to unexpected liabilities.  The foregoing matters could materially adversely affect the company's business.Expansion into the electronic asset disposition market has broadened the company's risk profile. The company has recently expanded into the electronics asset disposition business, pursuant to which it provides services related to electronic devices being disposed of by business customers,  including cleansing storage devices from customer equipment and either recycling it through resale or disposing of it in an environmentally compliant manner.  The company may also hold equipment in order to protect and preserve customer data.  If the company does not meet its contractual and regulatory obligations with respect to such data, it could be subject to contractual damages, penalties, and damage to reputation.  Also, the company's or its subcontractors' failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations in disposing of the equipment could result in liability.  Such environmental liability may be joint and several, meaning that the company could be held responsible for more than its share of the liability involved.   To the extent that company fails to comply with its obligations and such failure is not covered by insurance, the company's business could be adversely affected.The company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources. The company requires cash or committed liquidity facilities for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital, acquisition, and capital expenditure needs, as well as to refinance indebtedness.  At December 31, 2013, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $390.6 million.  In addition, the company currently has access to committed credit lines of $2.275 billion, of which the company had outstanding borrowings of $420.0 million at December 31, 2013.  The company's ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond its control. The company may, in the future, need to access the financial markets to satisfy its cash needs.  The company's ability to obtain external financing is affected by various factors including general financial market conditions and the company's debt ratings.  Further, any increase in the company's level of debt, change in status of its debt from unsecured to secured debt, or deterioration 9of its operating results may cause a reduction in its current debt ratings. Any downgrade in the company's current debt rating or tightening of credit availability could impair the company's ability to obtain additional financing or renew existing credit facilities on acceptable terms.  Under the terms of any external financing, the company may incur higher financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants. For example, the company's existing debt agreements contain restrictive covenants, including covenants requiring compliance with specified financial ratios, and a failure to comply with these or any other covenants may result in an event of default.  The company's lack of access to cost-effective capital resources, an increase in the company's financing costs, or a breach of debt covenants could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. The agreements governing some of the company's financing arrangements contain various covenants and restrictions that limit some of management's discretion in operating the business and could prevent the company from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to its business.The agreements governing the company's financings contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, could limit its ability to:•grant liens on assets;•make restricted payments (including paying dividends on capital stock or redeeming or repurchasing capital stock);•make investments;•merge, consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets;•incur additional debt; or•engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the company may be limited in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, compete effectively, or make investments.The company's failure to have long-term sales contracts may have a material adverse effect on its business.Most of the company's sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts.  The company generally works with its customers to develop non-binding forecasts for future orders.  Based on such non-binding forecasts, the company makes commitments regarding the level of business that it will seek and accept, the inventory that it purchases, and the levels of utilization of personnel and other resources.  A variety of conditions, both specific to each customer and generally affecting each customer's industry may cause customers to cancel, reduce, or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated, go bankrupt or fail, or default on their payments.  Generally, customers cancel, reduce, or delay purchase orders and commitments without penalty.  The company seeks to mitigate these risks, in some cases, by entering into noncancelable/nonreturnable sales agreements, but there is no guarantee that such agreements will adequately protect the company.  Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays in orders by customers, loss of customers, and/or customer defaults on payments could materially adversely affect the company's business.The company's revenues originate primarily from the sales of semiconductor, PEMCO (passive, electro-mechanical and interconnect), IT hardware and software products, the sales of which are traditionally cyclical. The semiconductor industry historically has experienced fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity and subject to significant economic market upturns and downturns.  Sales of semiconductor products and related services represented approximately 41%, 43%, and 47% of the company's consolidated sales in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.  The sale of the company's PEMCO products closely tracks the semiconductor market.  Accordingly, the company's revenues and profitability, particularly in its global components business segment, tend to closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market.  Further, economic weakness could cause a decline in spending in information technology, which could have a negative impact on the company's ECS business. A cyclical downturn in the technology industry could have a material adverse effect on the company's business and negatively impact its ability to maintain historical profitability levels.The company's non-U.S. sales represent a significant portion of its revenues, and consequently, the company is exposed to risks associated with operating internationally. In 2013, 2012, and 2011, approximately 53%, 52%, and 55%, respectively, of the company's sales came from its operations outside the United States.  As a result of the company's international sales and locations, its operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following: •import and export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;10•the burden and cost of compliance with international laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations; •potential restrictions on transfers of funds;•import and export duties and value-added taxes;•transportation delays and interruptions;•the burden and cost of compliance with complex multi-national tax laws and regulations;•uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations; •enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or similar laws of other jurisdictions;•foreign laws that potentially discriminate against companies which are headquartered outside that jurisdiction;•volatility associated with sovereign debt of certain international economies;•potential military conflicts and political risks; and•currency fluctuations, which the company attempts to minimize through traditional hedging instruments.Furthermore, products the company sells which are either manufactured in the United States or based on U.S. technology (""U.S. Products"") are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (""EAR"") when exported and re-exported to and from all international jurisdictions, in addition to the local jurisdiction's export regulations applicable to individual shipments.  Licenses or proper license exemptions may be required by local jurisdictions' export regulations, including EAR, for the shipment of certain U.S. Products to certain countries, including China, India, Russia, and other countries in which the company operates.  Non-compliance with the EAR or other applicable export regulations can result in a wide range of penalties including the denial of export privileges, fines, criminal penalties, and the seizure of inventories.  In the event that any export regulatory body determines that any shipments made by the company violate the applicable export regulations, the company could be fined significant sums and/or its export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.Also, the company's operating income margins are lower in certain geographic markets.  Operating income in the components business in Asia/Pacific and the global ECS business in Europe tends to be lower than operating income in the other markets in which the company sells products and services.  If sales in those markets increased as a percentage of overall sales, consolidated operating income margins will be lower.  The financial impact of lower operating income on returns on working capital is offset, in part, by lower working capital requirements.  While the company has and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business abroad, it cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on its business.When the company makes acquisitions, it may take on additional liabilities or not be able to successfully integrate such acquisitions.As part of the company's history and growth strategy, it has acquired other businesses.  Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:•effectively combining the acquired operations, technologies, or products;•unanticipated costs or assumed liabilities, including those associated with regulatory actions or investigations;•diversion of management's attention;•negative effects on existing customer and supplier relationships; and•potential loss of key employees, especially those of the acquired companies.Further, the company has made, and may continue to make acquisitions of, or investments in new services, businesses or technologies to expand its current service offerings and product lines.  Some of these may involve risks that may differ from those traditionally associated with the company's core distribution business, including undertaking product or service warranty responsibilities that in its traditional core business would generally reside primarily with its suppliers. If the company is not successful in mitigating or insuring against such risks, it could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.The company's goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of its assets and reduce its net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the assets acquired.  The company also ascribes value to certain identifiable intangible assets, which consist primarily of customer relationships and trade names, among others, as a result of acquisitions.  The company may incur impairment charges on goodwill or identifiable intangible assets if it determines that the fair values of the goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are less than their current carrying values.  The company evaluates, on a regular basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets may no longer be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary.  11Refer to Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and 'Critical Accounting Policies' in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion of the impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.  A decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations could impact the judgments and assumptions about the fair value of the company's businesses and the company could be required to record impairment charges on its goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the future, which could impact the company's consolidated balance sheet, as well as the company's consolidated statement of operations. If the company is required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the company's consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, or capital resources. If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discovers material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. An effective internal control environment is necessary for the company to produce reliable financial reports and is an important part of its effort to prevent financial fraud.  The company is required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal controls over financial reporting.  Based on these evaluations, the company may conclude that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable.  While management evaluates the effectiveness of the company's internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective.  There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment.  In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate financial statement risk.  If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or the company's independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in the company's internal controls, it may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.  In addition, the company may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or the NYSE.  Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the company's financial statements, which could cause the market price of its common stock to decline or limit the company's access to capital.The company relies heavily on its internal information systems, which, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect the company's business. The company's current global operations reside on multiple technology platforms.  The size and complexity of the company's computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, and random attack.  Likewise, data privacy breaches by employees and others who access the company's systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public.  While the company believes that it has taken appropriate security measures to protect its data and information technology systems, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in the company's systems that could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.  Because many of the company's systems consist of a number of legacy, internally developed applications, it can be harder to upgrade and may be more difficult to adapt to commercially available software.   The company has initiated a global enterprise resource planning (""ERP"") effort to standardize processes worldwide and adopt best-in-class capabilities. The company has committed significant resources to this new ERP system, which replaces multiple legacy systems of the company, and is expected to be implemented globally over the next several years.  This conversion is extremely complex, in part, because of the wide range of processes and the multiple legacy systems that must be integrated globally.  The company is using a controlled project plan that it believes will provide for the adequate allocation of resources.  However, such a plan, or a divergence from it, may result in cost overruns, project delays, or business interruptions.  During the conversion process, the company may be limited in its ability to integrate any business that it may want to acquire.  Failure to properly or adequately address these issues could impact the company's ability to perform necessary business operations, which could materially adversely affect the company's business.The company may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees and could limit the company's ability to use certain technologies in the future.Certain of the company's products and services include intellectual property owned primarily by the company's third party suppliers and, to a lesser extent, the company itself.  Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the semiconductor/integrated circuit, software and some service industries.  From time to time, third parties (including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent, copyright and/or other intellectual property rights to 12technologies that are important to the company's business.   In some cases, depending on the nature of the claim, the company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that the company is fully protected against such claims.  In addition, the company is exposed to potential liability for technology that it develops itself for which it has no indemnification protections.  In any dispute involving products or services that incorporate intellectual property developed, licensed by the company, or obtained through acquisition, the company's customers could also become the target of litigation.  The company is obligated in many instances to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the company sells are alleged to infringe any third party's intellectual property rights.  Any infringement claim brought against the company, regardless of the duration, outcome, or size of damage award, could:•result in substantial cost to the company;•divert management's attention and resources;•be time consuming to defend;•result in substantial damage awards; or•cause product shipment delays.Additionally, if an infringement claim is successful the company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.  The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase the company's operating expenses and harm the company's operating results and financial condition.  Also, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all.  The company may have to stop selling certain products or using technologies, which could affect the company's ability to compete effectively.    Compliance with government regulations regarding the use of ""conflict minerals"" may result in increased costs and risks to the company.  As part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the ""Act""), the SEC has promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, known as conflict minerals.  The disclosure rules will take effect for the company in May 2014.  The company will have to publicly disclose whether it manufactures (as defined in the Act) any products that contain conflict minerals and could incur significant costs related to implementing a process that will meet the mandates of the Act.  Additionally, customers typically rely on the company to provide critical data regarding the parts they purchase, including conflict mineral information.  The company's material sourcing is broad-based and multi-tiered, and it may not be able to easily verify the origins for conflict minerals used in the products it sells.  The company has many suppliers and each provides conflict mineral information in a different manner, if at all.  Accordingly, because the supply chain is complex, the company may face reputational challenges if it is unable to sufficiently verify the origins of conflict minerals used in its products.  Additionally, customers may demand that the products they purchase be free of conflict minerals.  This may limit the number of suppliers that can provide products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or at competitive prices"

Not only does the company compete with other distributors, it also competes for customers with many of its own suppliers.  Additional competition has emerged from third-party logistics providers, catalogue distributors, and brokers.  The company's failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could adversely affect its business and prospects.  Furthermore, the company's efforts to compete in the marketplace could cause deterioration of gross profit margins and, thus, overall profitability.  The sizes of the company's competitors vary across market sectors, as do the resources the company has allocated to the sectors in which it does business.  Therefore, some of the competitors may have a more extensive customer and/or supplier base than the company in one or more of its market sectors.Products sold by the company may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against the company, which may have a material adverse effect on the company.  The company sells its components at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated.  As a result, the company may face claims for damages (such as consequential damages) that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits it receives from the components involved in the claims.

The European Union, China, and other jurisdictions in which the company's products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other related matters. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of the company's products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters.

The company was also named as a defendant in a private lawsuit filed in connection with alleged contamination at a small industrial building formerly leased by Wyle Laboratories in El Segundo, California.  The lawsuit was settled, but the possibility remains that government entities or others may attempt to involve the company in further characterization or remediation of groundwater issues in the area.  The presence of environmental contamination could also interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect the company's ability to sell or lease its properties.  The discovery of contamination for which the company is responsible, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing requirements are enforced, could require the company to incur costs for compliance or subject it to unexpected liabilities.  The foregoing matters could materially adversely affect the company's business.Expansion into the electronic asset disposition market has broadened the company's risk profile. The company has recently expanded into the electronics asset disposition business, pursuant to which it provides services related to electronic devices being disposed of by business customers,  including wiping data from customer equipment and either recycling it through resale or disposing of it in an environmentally compliant manner.  The company may also hold equipment in order to protect and preserve customer data.  If the company does not meet its contractual and regulatory obligations with respect to such data, it could be subject to contractual damages, penalties, and damage to reputation.  Also, the company's or its subcontractors' failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations in disposing of the equipment could result in liability.  Such environmental liability may be joint and several, meaning that the company could be held responsible for more than its share of the liability involved.   To the extent that company fails to comply with its obligations and such failure is not covered by insurance, the company's business could be adversely affected.The company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources. The company requires cash or committed liquidity facilities for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital, acquisition, and capital expenditure needs, as well as to refinance indebtedness.  At December 31, 2012, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $409.7 million.  In addition, the company currently has access to committed credit lines of $1.975 billion, of which the company had outstanding borrowings of $348.6 million at December 31, 2012.  At December 31, 2012, the company also had 6.875% senior notes with a carrying value of $335.4 million maturing in July 2013. The company's ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond its control. The company may, in the future, need to access the financial markets to satisfy its cash needs.  The company's ability to obtain external financing is affected by various factors including general financial market conditions and the company's debt ratings.  While, thus far, uncertainties in global credit markets have not significantly affected the company's access to capital, future financing could be difficult or more expensive.  Further, any increase in the company's level of debt, change in status of its debt from unsecured to secured debt, or deterioration of its operating results may cause a reduction in its current debt ratings. Any downgrade in the company's current debt rating or tightening of credit availability could impair the company's ability to obtain additional financing or renew existing credit facilities on acceptable terms.  Under the terms of any external financing, the company may 9incur higher financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants. For example, the company's existing debt agreements contain restrictive covenants, including covenants requiring compliance with specified financial ratios, and a failure to comply with these or any other covenants may result in an event of default.  The company's lack of access to cost-effective capital resources, an increase in the company's financing costs, or a breach of debt covenants could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. The agreements governing some of the company's financing arrangements contain various covenants and restrictions that limit some of management's discretion in operating the business and could prevent the company from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to its business.The agreements governing the company's financings contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, could limit its ability to:•grant liens on assets;•make restricted payments (including paying dividends on capital stock or redeeming or repurchasing capital stock);•make investments;•merge, consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets;•incur additional debt; or•engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the company may be limited in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, compete effectively, or make investments.The company's failure to have long-term sales contracts may have a material adverse effect on its business.Most of the company's sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts.  The company generally works with its customers to develop non-binding forecasts for future volume of orders.  Based on such non-binding forecasts, the company makes commitments regarding the level of business that it will seek and accept, the inventory that it purchases, and the levels of utilization of personnel and other resources.  A variety of conditions, both specific to each customer and generally affecting each customer's industry may cause customers to cancel, reduce, or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated, go bankrupt or fail, or default on their payments.  Generally, customers cancel, reduce, or delay purchase orders and commitments without penalty.  The company seeks to mitigate these risks, in some cases, by entering into noncancelable/nonreturnable sales agreements, but there is no guarantee that such agreements will adequately protect the company.  Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays in orders by customers, loss of customers, and/or customer defaults on payments could materially adversely affect the company's business.The company's revenues originate primarily from the sales of semiconductor, PEMCO (passive, electro-mechanical and interconnect), IT hardware and software products, the sales of which are traditionally cyclical. The semiconductor industry historically has experienced fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity and subject to significant economic market upturns and downturns.  Sales of semiconductor products and related services represented approximately 43%, 47%, and 49% of the company's consolidated sales in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.  The sale of the company's PEMCO products closely tracks the semiconductor market.  Accordingly, the company's revenues and profitability, particularly in its global components business segment, tend to closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market.  Further, economic weakness could cause a decline in spending in information technology, which could have a negative impact on the company's ECS business. A cyclical downturn in the technology industry could have a material adverse effect on the company's business and negatively impact its ability to maintain historical profitability levels.The company's non-U.S. sales represent a significant portion of its revenues, and consequently, the company is exposed to risks associated with operating internationally. In 2012, 2011, and 2010, approximately 52%, 55%, and 56%, respectively, of the company's sales came from its operations outside the United States.  As a result of the company's international sales and locations, its operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following: •import and export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;•the burden and cost of compliance with international laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations; 10•potential restrictions on transfers of funds;•import and export duties and value-added taxes;•transportation delays and interruptions;•uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations; •enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or similar laws of other jurisdictions;•foreign laws that potentially discriminate against companies which are headquartered outside that jurisdiction;•recent volatility associated with sovereign debt of certain international economies;•potential military conflicts and political risks; and•currency fluctuations, which the company attempts to minimize through traditional hedging instruments.Furthermore, products the company sells which are either manufactured in the United States or based on U.S. technology (""U.S. Products"") are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (""EAR"") when exported and re-exported to and from all international jurisdictions, in addition to the local jurisdiction's export regulations applicable to individual shipments.  Licenses or proper license exemptions may be required by local jurisdictions' export regulations, including EAR, for the shipment of certain U.S. Products to certain countries, including China, India, Russia, and other countries in which the company operates.  Non-compliance with the EAR or other applicable export regulations can result in a wide range of penalties including the denial of export privileges, fines, criminal penalties, and the seizure of inventories.  In the event that any export regulatory body determines that any shipments made by the company violate the applicable export regulations, the company could be fined significant sums and/or its export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.Also, the company's operating income margins are lower in certain geographic markets.  Operating income in the components business in Asia/Pacific and the global ECS business in Europe tends to be lower than operating income in the other markets in which the company sells products and services.  As sales in those markets increased as a percentage of overall sales, consolidated operating income margins have fallen.  The financial impact of lower operating income on returns on working capital was offset, in part, by lower working capital requirements.  While the company has and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business abroad, it cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on its business.When the company makes acquisitions, it may take on additional liabilities or not be able to successfully integrate such acquisitions.As part of the company's history and growth strategy, it has acquired other businesses.  Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:•problems combining the acquired operations, technologies, or products;•unanticipated costs or assumed liabilities, including those associated with regulatory actions or investigations;•diversion of management's attention;•negative effects on existing customer and supplier relationships; and•potential loss of key employees, especially those of the acquired companies.Further, the company has made, and may continue to make acquisitions of, or investments in new services, businesses or technologies to expand our current service offerings and product lines.  Some of these may involve risks that may differ from those traditionally associated with our core distribution business, including undertaking product or service warranty responsibilities that in our traditional core business would generally reside primarily with our suppliers. If we are not successful in mitigating or insuring against such risks, they could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.The company's goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of its assets and reduce its net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the assets acquired.  The company also ascribes value to certain identifiable intangible assets, which consist primarily of customer relationships and trade names, among others, as a result of acquisitions.  The company may incur impairment charges on goodwill or identifiable intangible assets if it determines that the fair values of the goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are less than their current carrying values.  The company evaluates, on a regular basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill may no longer be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary.  Refer to Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and 'Critical Accounting Policies' in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion of the impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.  11A decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations could impact the judgments and assumptions about the fair value of the company's businesses and the company could be required to record impairment charges on its goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the future, which could impact the company's consolidated balance sheet, as well as the company's consolidated statement of operations. If the company was required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the company's consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings. If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discovers material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. An effective internal control environment is necessary for the company to produce reliable financial reports and is an important part of its effort to prevent financial fraud.  The company is required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal controls over financial reporting.  Based on these evaluations, the company may conclude that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable.  While management evaluates the effectiveness of the company's internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective.  There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment.  In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate financial statement risk.  If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or the company's independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in the company's internal controls, it may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.  In addition, the company may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or the NYSE.  Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the company's financial statements, which could cause the market price of its common stock to decline or limit the company's access to capital.The company relies heavily on its internal information systems, which, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect the company's business. The company's current global operations reside on multiple technology platforms.  The size and complexity of the company's computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion, and random attack.  Likewise, data privacy breaches by employees and others who access the company's systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public.  While the company believes that it has taken appropriate security measures to protect its data and information technology systems, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in the company's systems that could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.  Because most of the company's systems consist of a number of legacy, internally developed applications, it can be harder to upgrade and may be more difficult to adapt to commercially available software.   The company has initiated a global enterprise resource planning (""ERP"") effort to standardize processes worldwide and adopt best-in-class capabilities. The company has committed significant resources to this new ERP system, which replaces multiple legacy systems of the company, and is expected to be implemented globally over the next several years.  This conversion is extremely complex, in part, because of the wide range of processes and the multiple legacy systems that must be integrated globally.  The company is using a controlled project plan that it believes will provide for the adequate allocation of resources.  However, such a plan, or a divergence from it, may result in cost overruns, project delays, or business interruptions.  During the conversion process, the company may be limited in its ability to integrate any business that it may want to acquire.  Failure to properly or adequately address these issues could impact the company's ability to perform necessary business operations, which could materially adversely affect the company's business.The company may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees and could limit the company's ability to use certain technologies in the future.Certain of the company's products and services include intellectual property owned by the company and/or its third party suppliers.  Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the semiconductor/integrated circuit, software and some service industries.  From time to time, third parties (including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent, copyright and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company's business.   In some cases, depending on the nature of the claim, the company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that the company is fully protected against such claims.  In addition, the company is exposed to potential liability for technology that it develops itself for which it has no indemnification protections.  In any dispute involving products or services that incorporate 12intellectual property developed, licensed by the company, or obtained through acquisition, the company's customers could also become the target of litigation.  The company is obligated in many instances to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the company sells are alleged to infringe any third party's intellectual property rights.  Any infringement claim brought against the company, regardless of the duration, outcome, or size of damage award, could:•result in substantial cost to the company;•divert management's attention and resources;•be time consuming to defend;•result in substantial damage awards; or•cause product shipment delays.Additionally, if an infringement claim is successful the company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.  The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase the company's operating expenses and harm the company's operating results and financial condition.  Also, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all.  The company may have to stop selling certain products or using technologies, which could affect the company's ability to compete effectively.    Compliance with government regulations regarding the use of ""conflict minerals"" may result in increased costs and risks to the company.  As part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the ""Act""), the SEC has promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, known as conflict minerals.  The disclosure rules will take effect for the company in May 2014.  The company may have to publicly disclose whether the products it sells contain conflict minerals and could incur significant costs related to implementing a process that will meet the mandates of the Act.  Additionally, customers rely on the company to provide critical data regarding the parts they purchase and will likely request conflict mineral information.  The company's material sourcing is broad-based and multi-tiered, and it may not be able to easily verify the origins for conflict minerals used in the products it sells.  The company has many suppliers and each will provide conflict mineral information in a different manner, if at all.  Accordingly, because the supply chain is complex, the company may face reputational challenges if it is unable to sufficiently verify the origins of conflict minerals used in its products.  Additionally, customers may demand that the products they purchase be free of conflict minerals.  The implementation of this requirement could affect the sourcing and availability of products the company purchases from its suppliers. This may reduce the number of suppliers that may be able to provide conflict free products, and may affect the company's ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or at competitive prices"
1,ARW,ARROW ELECTRONICS INC,2012-02-01,"Risk Factors
.Described below and throughout this report are certain risks that the company's management believes are applicable to the company's business and the industry in which it operates.  If any of the described events occur, the company's business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected.  When stated below that a risk may have a material adverse effect on the company's business, it means that such risk may have one or more of these effects.  There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known.  There are also risks within the economy, the industry, and the capital markets that could materially adversely affect the company, including those associated with an economic recession, inflation, and a global economic slowdown.  There are also risks associated with the occurrence of natural disasters such as tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods. These factors affect businesses generally, including the company's customers and suppliers and, as a result, are not discussed in detail below except to the extent such conditions could materially affect the company and its customers and suppliers in particular ways. If the company is unable to maintain its relationships with its suppliers or if the suppliers materially change the terms of their existing agreements with the company, the company's business could be materially adversely affected. A substantial portion of the company's inventory is purchased from suppliers with which the company has entered into non-exclusive distribution agreements.  These agreements are typically cancelable on short notice (generally 30 to 90 days).  Certain parts of the company's business, such as the company's global ECS business, rely on a limited number of suppliers.  To the extent that the company's significant suppliers reduce the amount of products they sell through distribution, are unwilling to continue to do business with the company, or are unable to continue to meet or significantly alter their obligations, the company's business could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, to the extent that the company's suppliers modify the terms of their contracts with the company, limit supplies due to capacity constraints, or other factors, there could be a material adverse effect on the company's business.The competitive pressures the company faces could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.The market for the company's products and services is very competitive and subject to rapid technological change.  Not only does the company compete with other distributors, it also competes for customers with many of its own suppliers.  Additional competition has emerged from third-party logistics providers, catalogue distributors, and brokers.  The company's failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could adversely affect its business and prospects.  Furthermore, the company's efforts to compete in the marketplace could cause deterioration of gross profit margins and, thus, overall profitability.  The sizes of the company's competitors vary across market sectors, as do the resources the company has allocated to the sectors in which it does business.  Therefore, some of the competitors may have a more extensive customer and/or supplier base than the company in one or more of its market sectors.Products sold by the company may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against the company, which may have a material adverse effect on the company.  The company sells its components at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated.  As a result, the company may face claims for damages (such as consequential damages) that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits it receives from the components involved in the claims.  While the company typically has provisions in its supplier agreements that hold the supplier accountable for defective products, and the company and its suppliers generally exclude consequential damages in their standard terms and conditions, the company's ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited as a result of differing factors, such as the inability to exclude such damages due to the laws of some of the countries where it does business.  The company's business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in the products sold by the company, if it is required to pay for the associated damages.  Although the company currently has product liability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage and amount.  9Declines in value and other factors pertaining to the company's inventory could materially adversely affect its business. The market for the company's products and services is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in end-market demand, oversupply of product, and regulatory requirements, which can contribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of inventory.  Although most of the company's suppliers provide the company with certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and certain rights of return), the company cannot be sure that such protections will fully compensate it for the loss in value, or that the suppliers will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements.  For example, many of the company's suppliers will not allow products to be returned after they have been held in inventory beyond a certain amount of time, and, in most instances, the return rights are limited to a certain percentage of the amount of product the company purchased in a particular time frame.  All of these factors pertaining to inventory could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.The company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could materially adversely affect its business. The European Union, China, and other jurisdictions in which the company's products are sold have enacted or are proposing to enact laws addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal, use of hazardous materials in products, use of chemicals in manufacturing, recycling of products at the end of their useful life, and other related matters. These laws prohibit the use of certain substances in the manufacture of the company's products and directly and indirectly impose a variety of requirements for modification of manufacturing processes, registration, chemical testing, labeling, and other matters.  Failure to comply with these laws or any other applicable environmental regulations could result in fines or suspension of sales.  Additionally, these directives and regulations may result in the company having non-compliant inventory that may be less readily salable or have to be written off.  Some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigating or cleaning up contamination on or emanating from the company's currently or formerly owned, leased, or operated property, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personal injury arising out of such contamination.  As the distribution business, in general, does not involve the manufacture of products, it is typically not subject to significant liability in this area.  However, there may be occasions, including through acquisitions, where environmental liability arises.  For example, the company has recently expanded into the electronics asset disposition business, or EAD, pursuant to which, the company is responsible to its customers to dispose of certain assets in an environmentally compliant manner.  The company's or its subcontractors' failure to comply with the applicable environmental laws and regulations could result in additional liability.  Such liability may be joint and several, meaning that the company could be held responsible for more than its share of the liability involved.  The presence of environmental contamination could also interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect the company's ability to sell or lease its properties.  The discovery of contamination for which the company is responsible, the enactment of new laws and regulations, or changes in how existing requirements are enforced, could require the company to incur costs for compliance or subject it to unexpected liabilities.  The foregoing matters could materially adversely affect the company's business.The company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of environmental matters at two sites as a result of its Wyle Electronics acquisition, and the company is in litigation related to those sites.  In 2000, the company acquired Wyle Electronics (""Wyle"") and assumed its outstanding liabilities, including responsibility for environmental problems at sites Wyle had previously owned.  The Wyle purchase agreement includes an indemnification from the seller, now known as E.ON AG, in favor of the company, covering virtually all costs arising out of or in connection with those environmental obligations.  Two sites are known to have environmental issues, one at Norco, California and the other at Huntsville, Alabama.  The company has thus far borne most of the cost of the investigation and remediation of the Norco and Huntsville sites, under the direction of the cognizant state agencies.  The company has spent approximately $45.0 million to date in connection with these sites.  In addition, the company was named as a defendant in a private lawsuit filed in connection with alleged contamination at a small industrial building formerly leased by Wyle Laboratories in El Segundo, California.  The lawsuit was settled, but the possibility remains that government entities or others may attempt to involve the company in further characterization or remediation of groundwater issues in the area.E.ON AG acknowledged liability under the contractual indemnities with respect to the Norco and Huntsville sites and made a small initial payment, but has subsequently refused to make further payments.  As a result, the company is suing E.ON AG in the Regional Court in Frankfurt, Germany.  The litigation is currently suspended while the company engages in a court-facilitated mediation with E.ON AG.  The mediation commenced in December 2009 and is ongoing.As successor-in-interest to Wyle, the company is the beneficiary of the various Wyle insurance policies that covered liabilities arising out of operations at the two contaminated sites.  Certain of the insurance carriers implicated in actions, which were brought 10in Riverside, California, County Court by landowners and residents alleging personal injury and property damage caused by contaminated groundwater and related soil-vapor found in certain residential areas adjacent to the Norco site, have undertaken substantial portions of the defense of the company, and the company has recovered approximately $13.0 million from them to date. However, the company has sued certain other umbrella liability policy carriers because they have yet to make payment on claims filed by the company.  These disputes generally relate to the umbrella liability policy carriers' proportional share of the total liability as opposed to the applicability of coverage. The company believes strongly in the merits of its positions regarding the E.ON AG indemnity and the liabilities of the insurance carriers, but there can be no guarantee of the outcome of litigation.  Should and to the extent some or all of the insurance policies at issue prove insufficient or unavailable, and E.ON AG prevails in the litigation pending in Germany, the company would be responsible for the costs.  The total costs of (i) the investigation and remediation of the two sites, (ii) the defense of the company and the defense and indemnity of Wyle Laboratories in the Riverside County cases, (iii) the settlement amount in those cases, and (iv) the amount of any shortfall in the availability of the E.ON AG indemnity and/or the insurance coverage are all as yet undetermined.  Any or all of those costs could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. The company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources. The company requires cash or committed liquidity facilities for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital, acquisition, and capital expenditure needs, as well as to refinance indebtedness.  At December 31, 2011, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $396.9 million.  In addition, the company currently has access to committed credit lines of $1.975 billion, of which the company had outstanding borrowings of $354.0 million at December 31, 2011.  The company's ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond its control. The company may, in the future, need to access the financial markets to satisfy its cash needs.  The company's ability to obtain external financing is affected by various factors including general financial market conditions and the company's debt ratings.  While, thus far, uncertainties in global credit markets have not significantly affected the company's access to capital, future financing could be difficult or more expensive.  Further, any increase in the company's level of debt, change in status of its debt from unsecured to secured debt, or deterioration of its operating results may cause a reduction in its current debt ratings. Any downgrade in the company's current debt rating or tightening of credit availability could impair the company's ability to obtain additional financing or renew existing credit facilities on acceptable terms.  Under the terms of any external financing, the company may incur higher financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants. For example, the company's existing debt agreements contain restrictive covenants, including covenants requiring compliance with specified financial ratios, and a failure to comply with these or any other covenants may result in an event of default.  The company's lack of access to cost-effective capital resources, an increase in the company's financing costs, or a breach of debt instrument covenants could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. The agreements governing some of the company's financing arrangements contain various covenants and restrictions that limit some of management's discretion in operating the business and could prevent the company from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to its business.The agreements governing the company's financings contain various covenants and restrictions that, in certain circumstances, could limit its ability to:•grant liens on assets;•make restricted payments (including paying dividends on capital stock or redeeming or repurchasing capital stock);•make investments;•merge, consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets;•incur additional debt; or•engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the company may be limited in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt, compete effectively, or make investments.The company's failure to have long-term sales contracts may have a material adverse effect on its business.Most of the company's sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-term sales contracts.  The company generally works with its customers to develop non-binding forecasts for future volume of orders.  Based on such non-binding forecasts, the company makes commitments regarding the level of business that it will seek and accept, the inventory that it 11purchases, and the levels of utilization of personnel and other resources.  A variety of conditions, both specific to each customer and generally affecting each customer's industry may cause customers to cancel, reduce, or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated, go bankrupt or fail, or default on their payments.  Generally, customers cancel, reduce, or delay purchase orders and commitments without penalty.  The company seeks to mitigate these risks, in some cases, by entering into noncancelable/nonreturnable sales agreements, but there is no guarantee that such agreements will adequately protect the company.  Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays in orders by customers, loss of customers, and/or customer defaults on payments could materially adversely affect the company's business.The company's revenues originate primarily from the sales of semiconductor, PEMCO (passive, electro-mechanical and interconnect), IT hardware and software products, the sales of which are traditionally cyclical. The semiconductor industry historically has experienced fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity and subject to significant economic market upturns and downturns.  Sales of semiconductor products and related services represented approximately 47%, 49%, and 46% of the company's consolidated sales in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.  The sale of the company's PEMCO products closely tracks the semiconductor market.  Accordingly, the company's revenues and profitability, particularly in its global components business segment, tend to closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market.  Further, economic weakness of the financial and credit markets during 2008 and 2009 had a negative impact on the company's financial results.  The company's financial results for 2010 and 2011 suggest that the company's business has experienced a recovery; however, there can be no assurance that the recovery to date will continue at the current pace or at all.  Another downturn in the world's economies or in the technology industry could have a material adverse effect on the company's business and negatively impact its ability to maintain historical profitability levels.The company's non-U.S. sales represent a significant portion of its revenues, and consequently, the company is exposed to risks associated with operating internationally. In 2011, 2010, and 2009, approximately 55%, 56%, and 57%, respectively, of the company's sales came from its operations outside the United States.  As a result of the company's international sales and locations, its operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following: •import and export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;•the burden and cost of compliance with international laws, treaties, and technical standards and changes in those regulations; •potential restrictions on transfers of funds;•import and export duties and value-added taxes;•transportation delays and interruptions;•uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations; •enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or similar laws of other jurisdictions;•foreign laws that potentially discriminate against companies which are headquartered outside that jurisdiction;•recent volatility associated with sovereign debt of certain international economies;•potential military conflicts and political risks; and•currency fluctuations, which the company attempts to minimize through traditional hedging instruments.Furthermore, products the company sells which are either manufactured in the United States or based on U.S. technology (""U.S. Products"") are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (""EAR"") when exported and re-exported to and from all international jurisdictions, in addition to the local jurisdiction's export regulations applicable to individual shipments.  Licenses or proper license exemptions may be required by local jurisdictions' export regulations, including EAR, for the shipment of certain U.S. Products to certain countries, including China, India, Russia, and other countries in which the company operates.  Non-compliance with the EAR or other applicable export regulations can result in a wide range of penalties including the denial of export privileges, fines, criminal penalties, and the seizure of inventories.  In the event that any export regulatory body determines that any shipments made by the company violate the applicable export regulations, the company could be fined significant sums and/or its export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.Also, the company's operating income margins are lower in certain geographic markets.  Operating income in the components business in Asia/Pacific and the global ECS business in Europe tends to be lower than operating income in the other markets in which the company sells products and services.  As sales in those markets increased as a percentage of overall sales, consolidated operating income margins have fallen.  The financial impact of lower operating income on returns on working capital was offset, in part, by lower working capital requirements.  While the company has and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business abroad, it cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on its business.12When the company makes acquisitions, it may take on additional liabilities or not be able to successfully integrate such acquisitions.As part of the company's history and growth strategy, it has acquired other businesses.  Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:•problems combining the acquired operations, technologies, or products;•unanticipated costs or assumed liabilities, including those associated with regulatory actions or investigations;•diversion of management's attention;•negative effects on existing customer and supplier relationships; and•potential loss of key employees, especially those of the acquired companies.Further, the company has made, and may continue to make acquisitions of, or investments in new services, businesses or technologies to expand our current service offerings and product lines.  Some of these may involve risks that may differ from those traditionally associated with our core distribution business, including undertaking product or service warranty responsibilities that in our traditional core business would generally reside primarily with our suppliers.  In addition, with respect to the company's acquisition of EAD related businesses, its failure to properly safeguard confidential customer data could subject the company to penalties, damage to reputation, result in breaches of its contracts, and cause it to expend capital and other resources to protect against future security breaches. If we are not successful in mitigating or insuring against such risks, they could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.The company's goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of its assets and reduce its net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the assets acquired.  The company also ascribes value to certain identifiable intangible assets, which consist primarily of customer relationships and trade names, among others, as a result of acquisitions.  The company may incur impairment charges on goodwill or identifiable intangible assets if it determines that the fair values of the goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are less than their current carrying values.  The company evaluates, on a regular basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill may no longer be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary.  See Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and 'Critical Accounting Policies' in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion of the impairment testing of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.  A decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations could impact the judgments and assumptions about the fair value of the company's businesses and the company could be required to record impairment charges on its goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets in the future, which could impact the company's consolidated balance sheet, as well as the company's consolidated statement of operations. If the company was required to recognize an impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impact the company's consolidated cash flows, current liquidity, capital resources, and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, asset securitization program, and other outstanding borrowings. If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discovers material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. An effective internal control environment is necessary for the company to produce reliable financial reports and is an important part of its effort to prevent financial fraud.  The company is required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal controls over financial reporting.  Based on these evaluations, the company may conclude that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable.  While management evaluates the effectiveness of the company's internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective.  There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment.  In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate financial statement risk.  If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or the company's independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in the company's internal controls, it may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.  In addition, the company may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or the NYSE.  Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the company's financial statements, which could cause the market price of its common stock to decline or limit the company's access to capital.13The company relies heavily on its internal information systems, which, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect the company's business. The company's current global operations reside on multiple technology platforms.  The size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and random attack.  Likewise, data privacy breaches by employees and others who access our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public.  While we believe that we have taken appropriate security measures to protect our data and information technology systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could have a material adverse effect on the company's business.  Because most of the company's systems consist of a number of legacy, internally developed applications, it can be harder to upgrade and may be more difficult to adapt to commercially available software.   The company is in the process of converting its various business information systems worldwide to a single Enterprise Resource Planning system.  The company has committed significant resources to this conversion, and is expected to be phased in over several years.  This conversion is extremely complex, in part, because of the wide range of processes and the multiple legacy systems that must be integrated globally.  The company is using a controlled project plan that it believes will provide for the adequate allocation of resources.  However, such a plan, or a divergence from it, may result in cost overruns, project delays, or business interruptions.  During the conversion process, the company may be limited in its ability to integrate any business that it may want to acquire.  Failure to properly or adequately address these issues could impact the company's ability to perform necessary business operations, which could materially adversely affect the company's business.The company may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees and could limit the company's ability to use certain technologies in the future.Certain of the company's products and services include intellectual property owned by the company and/or its third party suppliers.  Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the semiconductor/integrated circuit, software and some service industries.  From time to time, third parties (including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent, copyright and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company's business.   In some cases, depending on the nature of the claim, the company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that the company is fully protected against such claims.  In addition, the company is exposed to potential liability for technology that it develops itself for which it has no indemnification protections.  In any dispute involving products or services that incorporate intellectual property developed, licensed by the company, or obtained through acquisition, the company's customers could also become the target of litigation.  The company is obligated in many instances to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the company sells are alleged to infringe any third party's intellectual property rights.  Any infringement claim brought against the company, regardless of the duration, outcome, or size of damage award, could:•result in substantial cost to the company;•divert management's attention and resources;•be time consuming to defend;•result in substantial damage awards; or•cause product shipment delays.Additionally, if an infringement claim is successful the company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.  The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase the company's operating expenses and harm the company's operating results and financial condition.  Also, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all.  The company may have to stop selling certain products or using technologies, which could affect the company's ability to compete effectively.    Compliance with government regulations regarding the use of  ""conflict minerals"" could result in difficulty in obtaining parts and be very costly to the company.  As part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act), the SEC has proposed disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, as well as procedures regarding a manufacturer's efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals.  The additional disclosure rules will take effect after the company's first full year following the promulgation of the SEC's final rules. The implementation of these requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of products we purchase from our suppliers. This may reduce the number of suppliers who provide products containing conflict free metals, and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, 14the company may have to publicly disclose its efforts regarding conflict minerals.  Our material sourcing is broad based and multi-tiered, and we may not be able to easily verify the origins for all metals used in our products.  As a result, the costs of such an effort could be significant"
2,ARW,ARROW ELECTRONICS INC,2009-02-26,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.Described below and throughout this report are certain risks that the companys management believesare applicable to the companys business and the industry in which it operates. If any of thedescribed events occur, the companys business, results of operations, financial condition,liquidity, or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected. When statedbelow that a risk may have a material adverse effect on the companys business, it means that suchrisk may have one or more of these effects. There may be additional risks that are not presentlymaterial or known. There are also risks within the economy, the industry and the capital marketsthat could materially adversely affect the company, including those associated with an economicrecession, and global economic slowdown. The recent financial crisis affecting the banking systemsand financial markets and the current uncertainty in global economic conditions have resulted in atightening in the credit markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, and extremevolatility in the credit and equity markets. These factors affect businesses generally and, as aresult, are not discussed in detail below except to the extent such conditions could materiallyaffect the company and its customers and suppliers in particular ways.If the company is unable to maintain its relationships with its suppliers or if the suppliersmaterially change the terms of their existing agreements with the company, the companys businesscould be materially adversely affected.A substantial portion of the companys inventory is purchased from suppliers with which the companyhas entered into non-exclusive distribution agreements. These agreements are typically cancelableon short notice (generally 30 to 90 days). Certain parts of the companys business, such as thecompanys global ECS business, rely on a limited number of suppliers. For example, sales fromproducts and services from one of the companys suppliers, IBM, accounted for approximately 11% ofthe companys consolidated sales in 2008. To the extent that the companys significant suppliersreduce the amount of products they sell through distribution, or are unwilling to continue to dobusiness with the company, or are unable to continue to meet its obligations, the companysbusiness could be materially adversely affected. In addition, to the extent that the companyssuppliers modify the terms of their contracts with the company, or extend lead times, limitsupplies due to capacity constraints, or other factors, there could be a material adverse effect onthe companys business.The competitive pressures the company faces could have a material adverse effect on the companysbusiness.The market for the companys products and services is very competitive and subject to rapidtechnological change. Not only does the company compete with other distributors, it also competesfor customers with many of its own suppliers. Additional competition has emerged from third-partylogistics providers, catalogue distributors, and brokers. The companys failure to maintain andenhance its competitive position could adversely affect its business and prospects. Furthermore,the companys efforts to compete in the marketplace could cause deterioration of gross profitmargins and, thus, overall profitability. The sizes of the companys competitors vary acrossmarket sectors, as do the resources the company has allocated to the sectors in which it doesbusiness. Therefore, some of the competitors may have a more extensive customer base than thecompany in one or more of its market sectors.Products sold by the company may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty and/or productliability claims may be asserted against the company, which may have a material adverse effect onthe company.The company sells its components at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of theequipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. Since a defect or failure in a productcould give rise to failures in the end products that incorporate them, the company may face claimsfor damages (such as consequential damages) that are disproportionate to the revenues and profitsit receives from the products involved in the claims. While the company typically has provisionsin its supplier agreements that hold the supplier accountable for defective products, and thecompany and its suppliers generallyexclude consequential damages in their standard terms and conditions, the companys ability toavoid9Table of Contentssuch liabilities may be limited as a result of differing factors, such as the inability toexclude such damages due to the laws of some of the countries where it does business. Thecompanys business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a significant quality orperformance issue in the products sold by the company, if it is required to pay for the associateddamages. Although the company currently has product liability insurance, such insurance is limitedin coverage and amount.Declines in value and other factors pertaining to the companys inventory could materiallyadversely affect its business.The market for the companys products and services is subject to rapid technological change,evolving industry standards, changes in end-market demand, and regulatory requirements, which cancontribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of inventory. During an economic downturn,prices could decline due to various factors including an oversupply of product and, therefore,there may be greater risk of declines in inventory value. Although most of the companys suppliersprovide the company with certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as priceprotection and certain rights of return), the company cannot be sure that such protections willfully compensate it for the loss in value, or that the suppliers will choose to, or be able to,honor such agreements. For example, many of the companys suppliers will not allow products to bereturned after they have been held in inventory beyond a certain amount of time, and, in mostinstances, the return rights are limited to a certain percentage of the amount of product thecompany purchased in a particular time frame. In addition, as discussed below, the companyhistorically has sold and continues to sell products that contain substances that are regulated, ormay be regulated, by various environmental laws. Some of the companys inventory may becomeobsolete as a result of these or other existing or new regulations. All of these factorspertaining to inventory could have a material adverse effect on the companys business.The company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could materially adversely affectits business.The company is subject to a wide and ever-changing variety of international and U.S. federal,state, and local laws and regulations, compliance with which may require substantial expense. Ofparticular note are three European Union (EU) directives known as the (i) Restriction of CertainHazardous Substances Directive (RoHS), (ii) the Waste Electrical and Electronic EquipmentDirective, and (iii) the Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH). Thefirst two directives restrict the distribution of products within the EU containing certainsubstances and require a manufacturer or importer to recycle products containing those substances.REACH will require companies to inform all purchasers of certain products in the EU to what extentthey contain certain substances covered by the legislation. In addition, China has passed theManagement Methods on Control of Pollution from Electronic Information Products, which prohibitsthe import of products for use in China that contain similar substances banned by the RoHSdirective. Failure to comply with these directives or any other applicable environmentalregulations could result in fines or suspension of sales. Additionally, these directives andregulations may result in the company having non-compliant inventory that may be less readilysalable or have to be written off.In addition, some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigatingor cleaning up contamination on or emanating from the companys currently or formerly owned,leased, or operated property, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and forpersonal injury arising out of such contamination. As the distribution business, in general, doesnot involve the manufacture of products, it is typically not subject to significant liability inthis area. However, there may be occasions, including through acquisitions, where environmentalliability arises. Such liability may be joint and several, meaning that the company could be heldresponsible for more than its share of the liability involved, or even the entire share. Inaddition, the presence of environmental contamination could also interfere with ongoing operationsor adversely affect the companys ability to sell or lease its properties. The discovery ofcontamination for which the company is responsible, or the enactment of new laws and regulations,or changes in how existing requirements are enforced, could require the company to incur costs forcompliance or subject it to unexpected liabilities.The foregoing matters could materially adversely affect the companys business.10Table of ContentsThe company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of environmental matters attwo sites as a result of its Wyle Electronics acquisition, and the company is in litigation relatedto those sites.In 2000, the company acquired Wyle Electronics (Wyle) and assumed its outstanding liabilities,including responsibility for environmental problems at sites Wyle had previously owned. The Wylepurchase agreement includes an indemnification from the seller, now known as E.ON AG, in favor ofthe company, covering virtually all costs arising out of or in connection with those environmentalobligations. Two sites are known to have environmental issues, one at Norco, California and theother at Huntsville, Alabama. The company has thus far borne most of the cost of the investigationand remediation of the Norco and Huntsville sites, under the direction of the cognizant stateagencies. The company has spent approximately $32 million to date in connection with these sites.In addition, the company was named as a defendant in a private lawsuit filed in connection withalleged contamination at a small industrial building formerly leased by Wyle Laboratories in ElSegundo, California. The lawsuit was settled, but the possibility remains that government entitiesor others may attempt to involve the company in further characterization or remediation ofgroundwater issues in the area.E.ON AG acknowledged liability under the contractual indemnities with respect to the Norco andHuntsville sites and made a small initial payment, but has subsequently refused to make furtherpayments. As a result, the company is suing E.ON AG in the Regional Court in Frankfurt, Germany.In addition, the company is a defendant in two actions brought in Riverside, California, CountyCourt by landowners and residents alleging personal injury and property damage caused bycontaminated groundwater and related soil-vapor found in certain residential areas adjacent to theNorco site. Co-defendant Wyle Laboratories, formerly a division of Wyle, has demanded defense andindemnification from the company in connection with the litigation, which the company must providesubject to the terms of several related agreements and orders. These costs are also part of thecompanys claim against E.ON AG.As successor-in-interest to Wyle, the company is the beneficiary of the various Wyle insurancepolicies that covered liabilities arising out of operations at the two contaminated sites. Certainof the carriers of the primary insurance policies implicated in the pending claims have undertakensubstantial portions of the defense of the company in the Riverside County cases, and the companyhas recovered approximately $10 million from them to date. The company has sued certain of theumbrella liability policy carriers, however, they have yet to make payment on the tendered losses.The company believes strongly in the merits of its positions regarding the E.ON AG indemnity, theliabilities of the insurance carriers, and the absence of compensable damage to the RiversideCounty plaintiffs, but there can be no guarantee of the outcome of litigation. Should and to theextent some or all of the insurance policies at issue prove insufficient or unavailable, and E.ONAG prevails in the litigation pending in Germany, the company would be responsible for the costs.The total costs of 1) the investigation and remediation of the two sites, 2) the defense of thecompany and the defense and indemnity of Wyle Laboratories in the Riverside County cases, 3) thepotential amount of any adverse verdict in those cases, and 4) the amount of any shortfall in theavailability of the E.ON AG indemnity and/or the insurance coverage are all as yet undetermined.Any or all of those costs could have a material adverse effect on the companys business.The company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources.The company requires cash or committed liquidity facilities for general corporate purposes, such asfunding its ongoing working capital, acquisition, and capital expenditure needs, as well as to makeinterest payments on and to refinance indebtedness. At December 31, 2008, the company had cash andcashequivalents of $451.3 million. In addition, the company currently has access to committed creditlines of $1.4 billion. The companys ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on its ability togenerate11Table of Contentscash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject togeneral economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that arebeyond its control.The company may, in the future, need to access the financial markets to satisfy its cash needs.The companys ability to obtain external financing is affected by general financial marketconditions and the companys debt ratings. While, thus far, uncertainties in global credit marketshave not significantly affected the companys access to capital, future financing could bedifficult or more expensive. Further, any increase in the companys level of debt, change instatus of its debt from unsecured to secured debt, or deterioration of its operating results maycause a reduction in its current debt ratings. Any downgrade in the companys current debt ratingor tightening of credit availability could impair the companys ability to obtain additionalfinancing or renew existing credit facilities on acceptable terms. Under the terms of any externalfinancing, the company may incur higher than expected financing expenses and become subject toadditional restrictions and covenants. For example, the companys existing debt agreements containrestrictive covenants, including covenants requiring compliance with specified financial ratios,and a failure to comply with these or any other covenants may result in an event of default. Thecompanys lack of access to cost-effective capital resources, an increase in the companysfinancing costs, or a breach of debt instrument covenants could have a material adverse effect onthe companys business.The agreements governing some of the companys financing arrangements contain various covenants andrestrictions that limit some of managements discretion in operating the business and could preventthe company from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to its business.The agreements governing the companys financings contain various covenants and restrictions that,in certain circumstances, could limit its ability to:  grant liens on assets;   make restricted payments (including paying dividends on capital stock or redeeming orrepurchasing capital stock);   make investments;   merge, consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets;   incur additional debt; or   engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the company may be limited in how it conducts itsbusiness and may be unable to raise additional debt, compete effectively, or make investments.The companys failure to have long-term sales contracts may have a material adverse effect on itsbusiness.Most of the companys sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-termsales contracts. The company generally works with its customers to develop non-binding forecastsfor future volume of orders. Based on such non-binding forecasts, the company makes commitmentsregarding the level of business that it will seek and accept, the inventory that it purchases, andthe levels of utilization of personnel and other resources. A variety of conditions, both specificto each customer and generally affecting each customers industry, may cause customers to cancel,reduce, or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated, go bankrupt or fail, ordefault on their payments. Generally, customers cancel, reduce, or delay purchase orders andcommitments without penalty. The company seeks to mitigate these risks, in some cases, by enteringinto noncancelable/nonreturnable sales agreements, but there is no guarantee that such agreementswill adequately protect the company. Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays inorders by customers, losses of customers, and/or customer defaults on payment could materiallyadversely affect the companys business.12Table of ContentsA large portion of the companys revenues comes from the sale of semiconductors, which, in thepast, has been a cyclical industry.The semiconductor industry historically has experienced fluctuations in product supply and demand,often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity and subject to significanteconomic market upturns and downturns. Sales of semiconductor products and related servicesrepresented approximately 46%, 48%, and 56% of the companys consolidated sales in 2008, 2007, and2006, respectively, and the companys revenues and profitability, particularly in its globalcomponents business segment, tend to closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductormarket. Any cyclical downturn in the technology industry, particularly in the semiconductor sector,could have a material adverse effect on the companys business and negatively impact its ability tomaintain historical profitability levels.The companys non-U.S. sales represent a significant portion of its revenues, and consequently, thecompany is increasingly exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.In 2008, 2007, and 2006, approximately 54%, 50%, and 53%, respectively, of the companys sales camefrom its operations outside the United States. As a result of the companys international salesand locations, its operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to internationaloperations, including the following:  import and export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;   the burden and cost of compliance with international laws, treaties, and technicalstandards and changes in those regulations;   potential restrictions on transfers of funds;   currency fluctuations;   import and export duties and value-added taxes;   transportation delays and interruptions;   uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations; and   potential military conflicts and political risks.Furthermore, products the company sells which are either manufactured in the United States or basedon U.S. technology (U.S. Products) are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR)when exported and re-exported to and from all international jurisdictions, in addition to the localjurisdictions export regulations applicable to individual shipments. Licenses or proper licenseexceptions may be required by local jurisdictions export regulations, including EAR, for theshipment of certain U.S. Products to certain countries, including China, India, Russia, and othercountries in which the company operates. Non-compliance with the EAR or other applicable exportregulations can result in a wide range of penalties including the denial of export privileges,fines, criminal penalties, and the seizure of commodities. In the event that any export regulatorybody determines that any shipments made by the company violate the applicable export regulations,the company could be fined significant sums and/or its export capabilities could be restricted,which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business.Also, the companys operating income margins are lower in certain geographic markets. Operatingincome in the components business in Asia/Pacific tends to be lower than operating income in NorthAmerica and Europe. As sales in Asia/Pacific increased as a percentage of overall sales,consolidated operating income margins have fallen. The financial impact of the lower operatingincome on returns on working capital was offset, in part, by lower working capital requirements.While the company has and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of lossesresulting from the risks of doing business abroad, it cannot ensure that such measures will beadequate and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on its business.13Table of ContentsWhen the company makes acquisitions, it may not be able to successfully integrate them.If the company is unsuccessful in integrating its acquisitions, or if integration is more difficultthan anticipated, the company may experience disruptions that could have a material adverse effecton its business.The companys goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could become impaired, which could reducethe value of its assets and reduce its net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the assetsacquired. The company also ascribes value to certain identifiable intangible assets, which consistprimarily of customer relationships, non-competition agreements, a long-term procurement agreement,customer databases, and sales backlog, among others, as a result of acquisitions. The company mayincur impairment charges on goodwill or identifiable intangibleassets if it determines that thefair values of the goodwill or identifiable intangible assets are less than their current carryingvalues. The company evaluates, on a regular basis, whether events or circumstances have occurredthat indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of goodwill may no longer be recoverable,in which case an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary.As a result of significant declines in macroeconomic conditions, there has been adecline in global equity valuations since October 1, 2008. Both of these factors have impacted thecompanys market capitalization, and the company determined itwas necessary to perform an interimimpairment test of its goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. Based upon the results of suchtesting, the company concluded that a portion of its goodwill was impaired and, as such, recognizeda non-cash impairment charge of $1.02 billion($905.1 million net of related taxes or $7.49 pershare on both a basic and diluted basis) as of December 31, 2008. The impairment charge did not impact thecompanys consolidated cash flows, liquidity, capital resources,and covenantsunder its existing revolving credit facility, asset securitization program, and other outstandingborrowings. No impairment existed as of December 31, 2008 withrespect to the companys identifiable intangible assets. See Notes 1 and 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements and Critical Accounting Policies in Managements Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations for further discussion of the impairment testing of goodwilland identifiable intangible assets.A continued decline in general economic conditions or global equity valuations, could impact thejudgments and assumptions about the fair value of the companysbusinesses and the company could be required to recordan additional impairment charge in the future, which could impact the companys consolidatedbalance sheet, as well as the companys consolidated statement of operations. If the company wasrequired to recognize an additional impairment charge in the future, the charge would not impactthe companys consolidated cash flows, current liquidity,capital resources and covenants under its existing revolving credit facility, asset securitization program, and otheroutstanding borrowings.If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discovers materialweaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, it may not be able to report itsfinancial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effecton its business.An effective internal control environment is necessary for the company to produce reliablefinancial reports and is an important part of its effort to prevent financial fraud. The companyis required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internalcontrols over financial reporting. Based on these evaluations, the company may conclude thatenhancements, modifications or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable. Whilemanagement evaluates the effectiveness of the companys internal controls on a regular basis, thesecontrols may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness ofinternal controls, including collusion, management14Table of Contentsoverride, and failure in human judgment. In addition, control procedures are designed to reducerather than eliminate business risks. If the company fails to maintain an effective system ofinternal controls, or if management or the companys independent registered public accounting firmdiscovers material weaknesses in the companys internal controls, it may be unable to producereliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on thecompanys business. In addition, the company may be subject to sanctions or investigation byregulatory authorities, such as the SEC or the NYSE. Any such actions could result in an adversereaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the companysfinancial statements, which could cause the market price of its common stock to decline or limitthe companys access to capital.The company relies heavily on its internal information systems, which, if not properly functioning,could materially adversely affect the companys business.The companys current global operations reside on multiple technology platforms. These platformsare subject to electrical or telecommunications outages, computer hacking, or other general systemfailure, which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business. Because most of thecompanys systems consist of a number of legacy, internally developed applications, it can beharder to upgrade and may be more difficult to adapt to commercially available software.The company is in the process of converting its various business information systems worldwide to asingle Enterprise Resource Planning system. The company has committed significant resources tothis conversion, which started in late 2006 and is expected to be phased in over several years.This conversion is extremely complex, in part, because of the wide range of processes and themultiple legacy systems that must be integrated globally. The company will be using a controlledproject plan that it believes will provide for the adequate allocation of resources. However, sucha plan, or a divergence from it, may result in cost overruns, project delays, or businessinterruptions. During the conversion process, the company may be limited in its ability tointegrate any business that it may want to acquire. Failure to properly or adequately addressthese issues could impact the companys ability to perform necessary business operations, whichcould materially, adversely affect the companys business.The company may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend,could require payment of damages or licensing fees and could limit the companys ability to usecertain technologies in the future.Certain of the companys products include intellectual property owned by the company and/or ourthird party suppliers. Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectualproperty rights exist in the semiconductor/integrated circuit and software industries. From timeto time, third parties (including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not forthe purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensingrevenue from purported infringers) may assert patent, copyright and/or other intellectual propertyrights to technologies that are important to the companys business. In some cases, depending onthe nature of the claim, the company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers foritself and its customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that it will be successfulin obtaining such indemnification or that the company is fully protected against such claims. Inaddition, the company is exposed to potential liability for technology that it develops itself forwhich we have no indemnification protections. In any dispute involving products that incorporateintellectual property developed or licensed by the company, the companys customers could alsobecome the target of litigation. We are obligated in many instances to indemnify and defend ourcustomers if the products or services we sell are alleged to infringe any third partysintellectual property rights. Any infringement claim brought against the company, regardless ofthe duration, outcome or size of damage award, could:  result in substantial cost to the company;   divert managements attention and resources;   be time consuming to defend;   result in substantial damage awards;   cause product shipment delays; or15Table of Contents  require the company to seek to enter into royalty or other licensing agreements.Additionally, if an infringement claim is successful the company may be required to pay damages orseek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase our operating expenses andharm the companys operating results and financial condition. Also, royalty or licensearrangements may not be available at all. The company may have to stop selling certain products orusing technologies, which could affect the companys ability to compete effectively"
6,ARW,ARROW ELECTRONICS INC,2008-02-08,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.Described below and throughout this report are certain risks that the companys management believesare applicable to the companys business and the industry in which it operates. There may beadditional risks that are not presently material or known. There are also risks within theeconomy, the industry and the capital markets that affect business generally, and the company aswell, which are not described.If any of the described events occur, the companys business, results of operations, financialcondition, liquidity, or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected.When stated below that a risk may have a material adverse effect on the companys business, itmeans that such risk may have one or more of these effects.A large portion of the companys revenues comes from the sale of semiconductors, which hashistorically been a cyclical industry.Although the market seems to have stabilized in recent years, the semiconductor industryhistorically has experienced fluctuations in product supply and demand, often associated withchanges in technology and manufacturing capacity. Sales of semiconductor products and relatedservices represented approximately 48%, 56%, and 53% of the companys consolidated sales in 2007,2006 and 2005, respectively, and the companys revenues and profitability, particularly in itsglobal components business segment, tend to closely follow the strength or weakness of thesemiconductor market. While the semiconductor industry has strengthened in recent years from itsdownturn in 2000 and 2001, any potential future cyclical downturns in the technology industry,particularly in the semiconductor sector, could have a material adverse effect on the companysbusiness and negatively impact its ability to maintain current profitability levels.If the company was unable to maintain its relationships with its suppliers or if the suppliersmaterially change the terms of their existing agreements with the company, the companys businesscould be materially adversely affected.A substantial portion of the companys inventory is purchased from suppliers with which the companyhas entered into non-exclusive distribution agreements. These agreements are typically cancelableon short notice (generally 30 to 90 days). Certain parts of the companys business, such as thecompanys global ECS business, rely on a limited number of suppliers. For example, sales fromproducts and services from one of the companys suppliers, IBM, accounted for approximately 10% ofits consolidated sales in 2007. To the extent that the companys significant suppliers areunwilling to continue to do business with the company, the companys business could be materiallyadversely affected. In addition, to the extent that the companys suppliers modify the terms oftheir contracts with the company (including, without limitation, the terms regarding priceprotection, rights of return, rebates, or other terms that are favorable to the company), or extendlead times, limit supplies due to capacity constraints, or other factors, there could be a materialadverse effect on the companys business.The competitive pressures the company faces could have a material adverse affect on the companysbusiness.The market for the companys products and services is very competitive and subject to rapidtechnological change. Not only does the company compete with other distributors, it also competesfor customers with many of its own suppliers. Additional competition has emerged from third-partylogistics providers, catalogue distributors, and brokers. The companys failure to maintain andenhance its competitive position could adversely affect its business and prospects. Furthermore,the companys efforts to compete in the marketplace could cause deterioration of gross profitmargins and, thus, overall profitability. The sizes of the companys competitors vary acrossmarket sectors, as do the resources the company has allocated to the sectors in which it doesbusiness. Therefore, some of the competitors may have more extensive customer base than thecompany has in all or more of its market sectors.8Table of ContentsProducts sold by the company may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty and/or productliability claims may be asserted against the company, which may have a material adverse effect onthe company.The company sells its components at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of theequipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. Since a defect or failure in a productcould give rise to failures in the end products that incorporate them (and claims for consequentialdamages against the company from its customers), the company may face claims for damages that aredisproportionate to the revenues and profits it receives from the products involved in the claims.While the company typically has provisions in its supplier agreements that hold the supplieraccountable for defective products, and the company and its suppliers generally excludeconsequential damages in their standard terms and conditions, the companys ability to avoid suchliabilities may be limited as a result of differing factors, such as the inability to exclude suchdamages due to the laws of some of the countries where it does business. The companys businesscould be materially adversely affected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue inthe products sold by the company, if it is required to pay for the damages that result. Althoughthe company currently has product liability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage andamount.Declines in value and other factors pertaining to the companys inventory could materiallyadversely affect its business.The market for the companys products and services is subject to rapid technological change,evolving industry standards, changes in end-market demand, and regulatory requirements, which cancontribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of inventory. During an economic downturn,prices could decline due to an oversupply of product and, therefore, there may be greater risk ofdeclines in inventory value. Although most of the companys suppliers provide the company withcertain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection and certainrights of return), the company cannot be sure that such protections will fully compensate it forthe loss in value, or that the suppliers will choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements. Forexample, many of the companys suppliers will not allow products to be returned after they havebeen held in inventory beyond a certain amount of time, and, in most instances, the return rightsare limited to a certain percentage of the amount of product the company purchased in a particulartime frame. In addition, as discussed below, the company historically has sold and continues tosell products that contain substances that are regulated, or may be regulated, by variousenvironmental laws. Some of the companys inventory may become obsolete as a result of these orother existing or new regulations. All of these factors pertaining to inventory could have amaterial adverse effect on the companys business.The company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could materially adversely affectits business.The company is subject to a wide and ever-changing variety of international and U.S. federal,state, and local laws and regulations, compliance with which may require substantial expense. Ofparticular note are two European Union (EU) directives known as the Restriction of CertainHazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic EquipmentDirective. These directives restrict the distribution of products within the EU containing certainsubstances and require a manufacturer or importer to recycle products containing those substances.In addition, China has recently passed the Management Methods on Control of Pollution fromElectronic Information Products, which will eventually prohibit the import of products for use inChina that contain similar substances banned by the RoHS directive. Failure to comply with thesedirectives or any other applicable environmental regulations could result in fines or suspension ofsales. Additionally, these directives and regulations may result in the company havingnon-compliant inventory that may be less readily salable or have to be written off.In addition, some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigatingor cleaning up contamination on or emanating from the companys currently or formerly owned,leased, or operated property, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and forpersonal injury arising out of such contamination. As the distribution business, in general, doesnot involve the manufacture of products, it is typically not subject to significant liability inthis area. However, there may be occasions, including through acquisitions, where environmentalliability arises. Such liability may be joint and several, meaning that the company could be heldresponsible for more than its share of the liability involved, or even the entire share. Inaddition, the presence of environmental contamination could also interfere with ongoing operationsor adversely affect the companys ability to sell or lease its properties. The discovery ofcontamination for which the company is responsible, or the enactment of new laws and regulations,or changes in how existing requirements are enforced, could require the company to incur costs forcompliance or subject it to9Table of Contentsunexpected liabilities.The foregoing matters could materially adversely affect the companys business.The company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of environmental matters attwo sites as a result of its Wyle Electronics acquisition, and the company is in litigation relatedto those sites.As a result of its acquisition of Wyle Electronics (Wyle) from the VEBA Group (VEBA) in 2000,the company assumed Wyles outstanding liabilities, including the responsibility for certainenvironmental contamination at sites formerly owned by Wyle. The agreement pursuant to which thecompany bought Wyle from VEBA contains an indemnification from VEBA to the company for all of thecosts associated with the Wyle environmental obligations. Two sites are known to have suchcontamination, one at Norco, California and the other at Huntsville, Alabama, and the company hasthus far borne most of the cost of the investigation and remediation of the Norco and Huntsvillesites, under the direction of the cognizant state agencies. The company has expended approximately$25 million to date in connection with these sites. In addition, the company was named as adefendant in a private lawsuit filed in connection with alleged contamination at a small industrialbuilding formerly leased by Wyle Laboratories in El Segundo, California. The lawsuit was settled, but thepossibility remains that government entities or others may attempt to involve the company infurther characterization or remediation of groundwater issues in the area.VEBAs successor-in-interest, E.ON AG, acknowledged liability under the VEBA contractualindemnities with respect to the Norco and Huntsville sites and made a small initial payment, buthas subsequently refused to make further payments. The company is engaged in litigation againstE.ON AG and certain other parties in the federal courts of the United States and in the Frankfurtam Main Regional Court in Germany. The company believes strongly in the merits of its cases andthe probability of recovery from E.ON AG, but there can be no guaranty of the outcome oflitigation, and, should the company lose on all of its claims in both cases, it would bear all ofthe cost of the Wyle environmental obligations. Because characterization and remedial design isnot yet complete at any of these sites, the future costs in excess of accrued costs associatedtherewith are as yet undetermined and could have a material adverse effect on the companysbusiness.In addition, the company is, along with other parties, a defendant in three suits, all of whichwere consolidated for pre-trial purposes, by plaintiff landowners and residents in Riverside CountyCourt in California for personal injury and property damages allegedly caused by the contaminatedgroundwater and related soil-vapor found in certain residential areas adjacent to the Norco site.Wyle Laboratories, formerly a division of Wyle Electronics, has demanded defense andindemnification from the company in connection with the litigation, and the company has, in turndemanded defense and indemnification from E.ON AG. The claims for indemnification are at issue inthe U.S. and Frankfurt court proceedings.While the company believes strongly in the merits of its claim for indemnification against E.ON AGand has no reason to believe that the plaintiffs allegations of damages in the Norco matterpending in Riverside County have merit, there can be no guaranty regarding the outcome of any ofthe matters, and should the company be found to be liable for damages and E.ON AG found not to beliable to indemnify the company for those damages and those costs that will be incurred in thefuture, it could have a material adverse effect on the companys business.The company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources.The company needs cash or committed liquidity facilities to make interest payments on and torefinance indebtedness, and for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing workingcapital, acquisition, and capital expenditure needs (including the companys new EnterpriseResource Planning system). At December 31, 2007, the company had cash and cash equivalents of$447.7 million. In addition, the company currently has access to committed credit lines of $1.4billion. The companys ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on its ability to generate cashfrom operations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic,financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond its control.The company may, in the future, need to access the financial markets to satisfy its cash needs.The companys ability to obtain external financing is affected by its debt ratings. Any increasein the companys level of debt, change in status of its debt from unsecured to secured debt, ordeterioration of its operating10Table of Contentsresults may cause a reduction in its current debt ratings. Any downgrade in the companys currentdebt rating could impair the companys ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms.Under the terms of any external financing, the company may incur higher than expected financingexpenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants. For example, the companysexisting debt agreements contain restrictive covenants, including covenants requiring compliancewith specified financial ratios, and a failure to comply with these or any other covenants mayresult in an event of default. An increase in the companys financing costs or a breach of debtinstrument covenants could have a material adverse effect on the companys business.The agreements governing some of the companys financing arrangements contain various covenants andrestrictions that limit the discretion of management in operating the business and could preventthe company from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to its business.The agreements governing the companys financings contain various covenants and restrictions that,in certain circumstances, could limit its ability to:  grant liens on assets;  make restricted payments (including paying dividends on capital stock or redeeming orrepurchasing capital stock);  make investments;  merge, consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets;  incur additional debt; or  engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the company may be limited in how it conducts itsbusiness and may be unable to raise additional debt, compete effectively, or make investments.The companys failure to have long-term sales contracts may have a material adverse effect on itsbusiness.Most of the companys sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-termsales contracts. The company generally works with its customers to develop non-binding forecastsfor future volume of orders. Based on such non-binding forecasts, the company makes commitmentsregarding the level of business that it will seek and accept, the inventory that it purchases, thetiming of production schedules, and the levels of utilization of personnel and other resources. Avariety of conditions, both specific to each customer and generally affecting each customersindustry, may cause customers to cancel, reduce, or delay orders that were either previously madeor anticipated. Generally, customers cancel, reduce, or delay purchase orders and commitmentswithout penalty. The company seeks to mitigate these risks, in some cases, by entering intononcancelable/nonreturnable sales agreements, but there is no guaranty that such agreements willadequately protect the company. Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, or delays inorders by customers could materially adversely affect the companys business.The companys non-U.S. locations represent a significant portion of its sales, and consequently,the company is increasingly exposed to risks associated with operating internationally.In 2007, 2006, and 2005, approximately 50%, 53%, and 47%, respectively, of the companys sales camefrom its operations outside the United States. As a result of the companys international salesand locations, its operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to internationaloperations, including the following:  import and export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;  the burden and cost of compliance with international laws, treaties, and technicalstandards and changes in those regulations;  potential restrictions on transfers of funds;  foreign currency fluctuations;  import and export duties and value-added taxes;  transportation delays and interruptions;  uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations; and  potential military conflicts and political risks.11Table of ContentsFurther, the companys operating income margins are lower in certain geographic markets. Operatingincome in the components business in Asia/Pacific tends to be lower than operating income in NorthAmerica and Europe. As sales in Asia/Pacific increased as a percentage of overall sales,consolidated operating income margins have fallen. The financial impact of the lower operatingincome on returns on working capital was offset, in part, by lower working capital requirements.While the company has and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of lossesresulting from the risks of doing business abroad, it cannot ensure that such measures will beadequate.When the company makes acquisitions, it may not be able to successfully integrate them or attainthe anticipated benefits.If the company is unsuccessful in integrating its acquisitions, or if integration is more difficultthan anticipated, the company may experience disruptions that could have a material adverse effecton its business. In addition, the company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from itsacquisitions, which could result in an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets.If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discoversmaterial weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, it may not be able to reportits financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverseeffect on its business.An effective internal control environment is necessary for the company to produce reliablefinancial reports and is an important part of its effort to prevent financial fraud. The companyis required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internalcontrols over financial reporting. Based on these evaluations, the company may conclude thatenhancements, modifications or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable. Whilemanagement evaluates the effectiveness of the companys internal controls on a regular basis, thesecontrols may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness ofinternal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment. Inaddition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks. If thecompany fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or thecompanys independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in thecompanys internal controls, it may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or preventfraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business. In addition, thecompany may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC orthe NYSE. Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to aloss of confidence in the reliability of the companys financial statements, which could cause themarket price of its common stock to decline or limit the companys access to capital.The regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions for which the company ships product could levysubstantial fines on the company or limit its ability to export and re-export products if thecompany ships product in violation of applicable export regulations.A significant percentage of the companys sales are made outside of the United States through theexporting and re-exporting of product. Many of the products the company sells are eithermanufactured in the United States or based on U.S. technology (U.S. Products). As a result, inaddition to the local jurisdictions export regulations applicable to individual shipments, U.S.Products are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) when exported and re-exportedto and from all international jurisdictions. Licenses or proper license exceptions may be requiredby local jurisdictions export regulations, including EAR, for the shipment of certain U.S.Products to certain countries, including China, India, Russia, and other countries in which thecompany operates. Non-compliance with the EAR or other applicable export regulations can result ina wide range of penalties including the denial of export privileges, fines, criminal penalties, andthe seizure of commodities. In the event that any export regulatory body determines that anyshipments made by the company violate the applicable export regulations, the company could be finedsignificant sums and/or its export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a materialadverse effect on the companys business.The company relies heavily on its internal information systems, which, if not properly functioning,could materially adversely affect the companys business.The companys current global operations reside on multiple technology platforms. These platformsare subject to electrical or telecommunications outages, computer hacking, or other general systemfailure, which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business. Because most of thecompanys systems12Table of Contentsconsist of a number of legacy, internally developed applications, it can be harder to upgrade andmay not be adaptable to commercially available software.The company is in the process of converting its various business information systems worldwide toa single Enterprise Resource Planning system. The company has committed significant resources tothis conversion, which started in late 2006 and is expected to be phased in over a four-yearperiod. This conversion is extremely complex, in part, because of the wide range of processes andthe multiple legacy systems that must be integrated globally. The company will be using acontrolled project plan that it believes will provide for the adequate allocation of resources.However, such a plan, or a divergence from it, may result in cost overruns, project delays, orbusiness interruptions. During the conversion process, the company may be limited in its abilityto integrate any business that it may want to acquire. Failure to properly or adequately addressthese issues could impact the companys ability to perform necessary business operations, whichcould materially, adversely affect the companys business.The company may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend,could require payment of damages or licensing fees and could limit the companys ability to usecertain technologies in the future.The company sells products and utilizes processes that are highly innovative and may be subject toallegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Without limitingthe generality of the foregoing, the company notes that in recent years certain companies in thebusiness of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intentionof aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers have made an increasing numberof claims against the company and/or its customers. In some cases, depending on the nature of theclaim, the company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and itscustomers against such claims, but there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtainingsuch indemnification.Intellectual property right infringement claims, with or without merit, can be time-consuming andcostly to litigate or settle and can divert management resources and attention. If successfulthey may require the company to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may notbe available on commercially reasonable terms. The payment of any such damages or royalties maysignificantly increase the companys operating expenses and harm its operating results andfinancial condition. Also, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all. Thecompany may have to stop selling certain products or using technologies, which could affect thecompanys ability to compete effectively"

There are also risks within theeconomy, the industry and the capital markets that affect business generally, and the company aswell, which have not been described.If any of the described events occur, the companys business, results of operations, financialcondition, liquidity, or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected.When stated below that a risk may have a material adverse effect on the companys business, itmeans that such risk may have one or more of these effects.A large portion of the companys revenues comes from the sale of semiconductors, which is a highlycyclical industry, and an industry down-cycle could have a material adverse effect on the companysbusiness.The semiconductor industry historically has experienced fluctuations in product supply and demand,often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity, and is generally consideredto be highly cyclical. Sales of semiconductor products and related services representedapproximately 56% of the companys consolidated sales in 2006 and 53% in both 2005 and 2004, andthe companys revenues, particularly in its electronic components businesses, tend to closelyfollow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market. While the semiconductor industry hasstrengthened in recent years, it is uncertain whether this improvement will continue, and futuredownturns in the technology industry, particularly in the semiconductor sector, could have amaterial adverse effect on the companys business and negatively impact its ability to maintaincurrent profitability levels.If the company is unable to maintain its relationships with its suppliers, its business could bematerially adversely affected.Substantially all of the companys inventory is purchased from suppliers with which the company hasentered into non-exclusive distribution agreements. These agreements are typically cancelable onshort notice (generally 30 to 90 days). Certain parts of the companys business, such as thecompanys ECS business, rely on a limited number of suppliers. To the extent that the companyssignificant suppliers are unwilling to continue to do business with the company, the companysbusiness could be materially adversely affected. In addition, to the extent that the companyssuppliers modify the terms of their contracts with the company (including, without limitation, theterms regarding price protection, rights of return, rebates, or other terms that are favorable tothe company), or extend lead times, limit supplies due to capacity constraints, or other factors,there could be a material adverse effect on the companys business.The company operates in a competitive industry and continues to be under the pressure of erodinggross profit margins, which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business.The market for the companys products and services is very competitive and subject to rapidtechnological change. Not only does the company compete with other distributors, it also competesfor customers with many of its own suppliers. Additional competition has emerged from third-partylogistics providers, fulfillment companies, catalogue distributors and online distributors andbrokers.Additionally, prices for the companys products tend to decrease over their life cycle, which canresult in decreased gross profit margins for the company. There is also substantial and continuingpressure from customers to reduce their total cost for products. Suppliers may also seek toincrease their own profitability by reducing the companys gross profit margin on products theysell to the company. The company expends substantial amounts on the value creation servicesrequired to remain competitive, retain existing business, and gain new customers, and the companymust evaluate the expense of those efforts against the impact of price and margin reductions.Further, our margins are lower in certain geographic markets and certain parts of our business thanin others. For example, the components we sell in the Asian markets tend to have lower profitmargins than in North America and Europe. Additionally, our ECS products typically have lowerprofit margins than our componentsbusinesses. As our ECS sales and sales in lower margin jurisdictions have increased as apercentage of overall sales, our profit margins have fallen. Thus, the companys consolidatedgross profit margins have eroded over time, from 16.2% in 2004 to 15.0% in 2006. If the company isunable to effectively compete in its7Table of Contentsindustry or is unable to maintain acceptable gross profitmargins, its business could be materially adversely affected.Products sold by the company may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty and/or productliability claims may be asserted against the company, which may have a material adverse effect onthe company.The company sells its components at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of theequipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. Since a defect or failure in a productcould give rise to failures in the end products that incorporate them (and claims for consequentialdamages against the company from its customers), the company may face claims for damages that aredisproportionate to the revenues and profits it receives from the products involved in the claims.While the company and its suppliers generally exclude consequential damages in their standard termsand conditions, the companys ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited as a result ofdiffering factors, such as the inability to exclude such damages due to the laws of some of thecountries where it does business. The companys business could be materially adversely affected asa result of a significant quality or performance issue in the products sold by the company, if itis required to pay for the damages that result. Although the company currently has productliability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage and amount.Declines in value and other factors pertaining to the companys inventory could materiallyadversely affect its business.The electronic components and computer products industries are subject to rapid technologicalchange, evolving industry standards, changes in end-market demand, and regulatory requirements,which can contribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of inventory. During an economicdownturn, prices could decline due to an oversupply of product and, therefore, there may begreater risk of declines in inventory value. Although most of the companys suppliers provide thecompany with certain protections from the loss in value of inventory (such as price protection andcertain rights of return), the company cannot be sure that such protections will fully compensateit for the loss in value, or that the suppliers will choose to, or be able to, honor suchagreements.

In addition, as discussed below, the company historically has sold andcontinues to sell products that contain substances that are regulated, or may be regulated, byvarious environmental laws. Some of the companys inventory may become obsolete as a result ofthese or other existing or new regulations. All of these factors pertaining to inventory couldhave a material adverse effect on the companys business.The company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could materially adversely affectits business.The company is subject to a wide and ever-changing variety of foreign and U.S. federal, state, andlocal laws and regulations, compliance with which may require substantial expense. Of particularnote are two European Union (EU) directives known as the Restriction of Certain HazardousSubstances Directive (RoHS) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive. Thesedirectives restrict the distribution of products within the EU containing certain substances andrequire a manufacturer or importer to recycle products containing those substances. In addition,China has recently passed the Management Methods on Control of Pollution from ElectronicInformation Products, which will eventually prohibit the import of products for use in China thatcontain the same substances banned by the RoHS directive. Failure to comply with these directivesor any other applicable environmental regulations could result in fines or suspension of sales.Additionally, these directives and regulations may result in the company having non-compliantinventory that may be less readily salable or have to be written off.In addition, some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigatingor cleaning up contamination on or emanating from the companys currently or formerly owned,leased, or operated property, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and forpersonal injury arising out of such contamination.

Thediscovery of contamination for which the company is responsible, or the enactment of new laws andregulations, or changes in how existing8Table of Contentsrequirements are enforced, could require the company toincur costs for compliance or subject it to unexpected liabilities.The foregoing matters could materially adversely affect the companys business.The company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of environmental problems attwo sites and has been named as a defendant with regard to a third site as a result of its WyleElectronics acquisition, and the company is in litigation related to those sites.As a result of its acquisition of Wyle Electronics (Wyle) from the VEBA Group (VEBA) in 2000,the company assumed Wyles outstanding liabilities, including the responsibility for certainenvironmental contamination at sites formerly owned by Wyle. The agreement pursuant to which thecompany bought Wyle from VEBA contains an indemnification from VEBA to the company for all of thecosts associated with the Wyle environmental obligations. Three sites are known to have suchcontamination, one at Norco, California, one at El Segundo, California, and the third atHuntsville, Alabama, and the company has thus far borne most of the cost of the investigation andremediation of the Norco and Huntsville sites, under the direction of the cognizant state agencies.The company has expended more than $17 million to date in connection with these sites. Withregard to the El Segundo site, the company has also been named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed inconnection with alleged contamination at a small industrial building formerly leased by WyleLaboratories. The outcome of the lawsuit, the nature of any contamination, and the amount of anyassociated liability are as yet unknown.VEBAs successor-in-interest, E.ON AG, acknowledged liability under the VEBA contractualindemnities with respect to the Norco and Huntsville sites and made a small initial payment, buthas subsequently refused to make further payments. As a result, the company has initiatedlitigation against E.ON AG and certain others in the United States District Court for the CentralDistrict of California and in the Frankfurt am Main Regional Court in Germany. The companybelieves strongly in the merits of its cases and the probability of recovery from E.ON AG, butthere can be no guaranty of the outcome of litigation, and, should the company lose on all of itsclaims in both cases, it would bear all of the cost of the Wyle environmental obligations. Becausecharacterization and remedial design is not yet complete at any of these sites, the future costs inexcess of accrued costs associated there with are as yet undetermined and could have a materialadverse effect on the company.In addition, the company is, along with other parties, a defendant in three suits, all of whichhave been consolidated for pre-trial purposes, by plaintiff landowners and residents in RiversideCounty Court in California for personal injury and property damages allegedly caused by thecontaminated groundwater and related soil-vapor found in certain residential areas adjacent to theNorco site. Wyle Laboratories, formerly a division of Wyle Electronics, has demanded defense andindemnification from the company in connection with the litigation, and the company has, in turndemanded defense and indemnification from E.ON AG. The claims for indemnification are at issue inthe U.S. District Court and Frankfurt Regional Court proceedings.While the company believes strongly in the merits of its claim for indemnification against E.ON AGand has no reason to believe that the plaintiffs allegations of damages in the Norco matterpending in Riverside County have merit, there can be no guaranty regarding the outcome of any ofthe matters, and should the company be found to be liable for damages and E.ON AG found not to beliable to indemnify the company for those damages and those costs that will be incurred in thefuture, it could have a material adverse effect on the company.The company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources.The company needs cash or committed liquidity facilities to make interest payments on and torefinance indebtedness, and for general corporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing workingcapital, acquisition, and capital expenditure needs. At December 31, 2006, the company had cashand cash equivalents of $337.7 million. In addition, the company currently has access to creditlines in excess of $1.3 billion. The companys ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on itsability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets, both of which aresubject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factorsthat are beyond its control.The company may, in the future, need to access the financial markets to satisfy its cash needs.The companys ability to obtain external financing is affected by its debt ratings. Any increasein the companys level of debt, change in status of its debt from unsecured to secured debt, ordeterioration of its operating results may cause a reduction in its current debt ratings. Anydowngrade in the companys current debt rating9Table of Contentscould impair the companys ability to obtainadditional financing on acceptable terms. Under the terms of any external financing, the companymay incur higher than expected financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions andcovenants. For example, the companys existing debt agreements contain restrictive covenants,including covenants requiring compliance with specified financial ratios, and a failure to complywith these or any other covenants may result in an event of default. An increase in the companysfinancing costs or a breach of debt instrument covenants could have a material adverse effect onthe company.The agreements governing some of the companys financing arrangements contain various covenants andrestrictions that limit the discretion of management in operating the business and could preventthe company from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to its business.The agreements governing the companys financings contain various covenants and restrictions that,in certain circumstances, could limit its ability to:  grant liens on assets;   make restricted payments (including paying dividends on capital stock or redeeming orrepurchasing capital stock);   make investments;   merge, consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of its assets;   incur additional debt; or   engage in certain transactions with affiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the company may be limited in how it conducts itsbusiness and may be unable to raise additional debt, compete effectively, or make investments.The companys failure to have long-term sales contracts may have a material adverse effect on itsbusiness.Most of the companys sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-termsales contracts. The company generally works with its customers to develop non-binding forecastsfor future volume of orders. Based on such non-binding forecasts, the company makes commitmentsregarding the level of business that it will seek and accept, the inventory that it purchases, thetiming of production schedules, and the levels of utilization of personnel and other resources. Avariety of conditions, both specific to each customer and generally affecting each customersindustry, may cause customers to cancel, reduce, or delay orders that were either previously madeor anticipated. Generally, customers cancel, reduce, or delay purchase orders and commitmentswithout penalty. The company seeks to mitigate these risks, in some cases, by entering intononcancelable/nonreturnable sales agreements, but there is no guaranty that such agreements willadequately protect the company. Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, or delays inorders by customers could materially adversely affect the companys business.The companys non-U.S. locations represent a significant and growing portion of its sales, andconsequently, the company is increasingly exposed to risks associated with operatinginternationally.In 2006, 2005, and 2004, approximately 53%, 47%, and 46%, respectively, of the companys sales camefrom its operations outside the United States. As a result of the companys foreign sales andlocations, its operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to internationaloperations, including the following:  import and export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;   the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties, and technical standardsand changes in those regulations;   potential restrictions on transfers of funds;   foreign currency fluctuations;   import and export duties and value-added taxes;   transportation delays and interruptions;   uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations; and   potential military conflicts and political risks.While the company has and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of lossesresulting from the risks of doing business abroad, it cannot ensure that such measures will beadequate.10Table of ContentsWhen the company makes acquisitions, it may not be able to successfully integrate them or attainthe anticipated benefits.If the company is unsuccessful in integrating its acquisitions, or ifintegration is more difficult than anticipated, the company may experience disruptions that couldhave a material adverse effect on its business. In addition, the company may not realize all ofthe anticipated benefits from its acquisitions, which could result in an impairment of goodwill orother intangible assets.If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discoversmaterial weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, it may not be able to reportits financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverseeffect on its business.An effective internal control environment is necessary for the company to produce reliablefinancial reports and is an important part of its effort to prevent financial fraud. The companyis required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internalcontrols over financial reporting. Based on these evaluations, the company may conclude thatenhancements, modifications or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable. Whilemanagement evaluates the effectiveness of the companys internal controls on a regular basis, thesecontrols may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness ofinternal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure of human judgment. Inaddition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks. If thecompany fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or thecompanys independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in thecompanys internal controls, it may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or preventfraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business. In addition, thecompany may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatoryauthorities, such as the SEC or the NYSE. Any such actions could result in an adversereaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the companysfinancial statements, which could cause the market price of its common stock to decline or limitthe companys access to capital.The regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions for which the company ships product could levysubstantial fines on the company or limit its ability to export and re-export products if thecompany ships product in violation of applicable export regulations.A significant percentage of the companys sales are made outside of the United States through theexporting and re-exporting of product. Many of the products the company sells are eithermanufactured in the United States or based on U.S. technology (U.S. Products). As a result, inaddition to the local jurisdictions export regulations applicable to individual shipments, U.S.Products are subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) when exported and re-exportedto and from all international jurisdictions. Licenses or proper license exceptions may be requiredby local jurisdictions export regulations, including EAR, for the shipment of certain U.S.Products to certain countries, including China, India, Russia, and other countries in which thecompany operates. Non-compliance with the EAR or other applicable export regulations can result ina wide range of penalties including the denial of export privileges, fines, criminal penalties, andthe seizure of commodities. In the event that any export regulatory body determines that anyshipments made by the company violate the applicable export regulations, the company could be finedsignificant sums and/or its export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a materialadverse effect on the companys business.The company relies heavily on its internal information systems, which, if not properly functioning,could materially adversely affect the companys business.The companys current global operations reside on multiple technology platforms. These platformsare subject to electrical or telecommunications outages, computer hacking, or other general systemfailure, which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business. Because most of thecompanys systems consist of a number of legacy, internally developed applications, it can beharder to upgrade and may not be adaptable to commercially available software. Additionally, thecompany recently completed the process of installing certain modules in North America as part of aphased implementation schedule associated with the design of a new global financial system. Thecompany is about to undergo the same process in Asia and parts of Europe. There is no guaranteethat the implementation will be successful or that there will not be integration difficulties thatwill adversely affect the companys operations or the accurate recording and11Table of Contentsreporting of financialdata. Failure ofthe companys internal information systems or material difficulties in upgrading its globalfinancial system could have material adverse effects on its business.Further, the company is converting its various business information systems worldwide to a singleEnterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. The company has committed significant resources tothis conversion, which started in late 2006 and is expected to be phased in over the next fouryears. This conversion is extremely complex, in part, because of the wide range of processes andthe multiple legacy systems that must be integrated globally. The company will be using acontrolled project plan that it believes will provide for the adequate allocation of resources.However, such a plan, or a divergence from it, may result in cost overruns, project delays, orbusiness interruptions. During the conversion process, the company may be limited in its abilityto integrate any business that it may want to acquire. Failure to properly or adequately addressthese issues could impact the companys ability to perform necessary business operations, whichcould materially adversely affect the companys business"
5,ARW,ARROW ELECTRONICS INC,2006-02-27,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.Described below and throughout this report are certain risks that the companys management believesare applicable to the companys business and the industry in which it operates. There may beadditional risks that are not presently material or known. There are also risks within theeconomy, the industry and the capital markets that affect business generally, and the company aswell, which have not been described.If any of the described events occur, the companys business, results of operations, financialcondition, liquidity or access to the capital markets could be materially adversely affected. Whenstated below that a risk may have a material adverse effect on the companys business, it meansthat such risk may have one or more of these effects.A large portion of the companys revenues come from the sale of semiconductors, which is a highlycyclical industry, and an industry down-cycle could have a material adverse effect on the companysbusiness.The semiconductor industry historically has experienced fluctuations in product supply and demand,often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity, and is generally consideredto be highly cyclical. During the last three fiscal years, sales of semiconductor products andrelated services represented approximately 53% of the companys consolidated sales, and thecompanys revenues, particularly in its electronic components group, tend to closely follow thestrength or weakness of the semiconductor market. For example, as a result of the semiconductorindustry downturn in 2001 and 2002, the companys revenues fell from $12.0 billion in 2000 to $9.4billion in 2001 and $7.3 billion in 2002. The company also generated a net loss in 2001 and 2002.While the semiconductor industry has strengthened in recent years, it is uncertain whether thisimprovement will continue, and future downturns in the technology industry, particularly in thesemiconductor sector, could have a material adverse effect on the companys business and negativelyimpact its ability to maintain current profitability levels.If the company is unable to maintain its relationshipswith its suppliers, its business could be materially adversely affected.Substantially all of the companys inventory has been and will be purchased from suppliers withwhich the company has entered into non-exclusive distribution agreements. These agreements aretypically cancelable on short notice (generally 30 to 90 days). There are also certain parts ofthe companys business that rely on a limited number of suppliers. For a significant portion ofthe companys Arrow Enterprise Computing Solutions business, the company relies on three suppliers.To the extent that the companys significant suppliers are unwilling to do business with thecompany, the companys business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, to the extentthat the companys suppliers modify the terms of their contracts with the company (including,without limitation, the terms regarding price protection, rights of return, rebates or other termsthat are favorable to the company), or extend lead times, limit supplies due to capacityconstraints or other factors, there could a material adverse affect on the companys business.The company operates in a competitive industry and continues to be under the pressure of erodinggross profit margins, which could have a material adverse effect on the companys business.The market for the companys products and services is very competitive and subject to rapidtechnological change. Not only does the company compete with other distributors, it also competesfor customers with many of its own suppliers. This is particularly true of the companys largercustomers whose volumes of purchases make them more attractive to suppliers for direct sales.Additional competition has emerged from third party logistics providers, fulfillment companies,catalogue distributors and on-line distributors and brokers.Additionally, prices for the companys products tend to decrease over their life cycle. Suchdecreases often result in decreased gross profit margins for the company. There is alsosubstantial and continuing pressure from customers to reduce their total cost for products.Suppliers may also seek to reduce the companys margins on the sale of their products in order toincrease their own profitability. The company expends substantial amounts on the value creationservices required to remain competitive, retain existing business and gain new customers, and the company must evaluate the expense of those efforts against theimpact of price and margin reductions.8Table of ContentsFurther, the manufacturing of electronic components and computer products is increasingly shiftingto lower-cost production facilities in Asia, most notably China. Suppliers in Asia havetraditionally had lower gross profit margins than those in the United States and Europe, andtypically charge lower prices in the Asian markets for their products, which places pressure on thecompany to lower its prices to meet competition. Thus, the companys consolidated gross profitmargins have eroded over time, from 16.7% in 2003, to 16.2% in 2004, and 15.6% in 2005. If thecompany is unable to effectively compete in its industry or is unable to maintain acceptable grossprofit margins, its business could be materially adversely affected.Products sold by the company may be found to be defective and, as a result, warranty and/or productliability claims may be asserted against the company which may have a material adverse effect onthe company.Products sold by the company are at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of theequipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. Since a defect or failure in a productcould give rise to failures in the end products that incorporate them (and claims for consequentialdamages against the company from its customers), the company may face claims for damages that aredisproportionate to the sales and profits it receives from the products involved. While thecompany and its suppliers specifically exclude consequential damages in their standard terms andconditions, the companys ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited by the laws of some ofthe countries where it does business. The companys business could be materially adverselyaffected as a result of a significant quality or performance issue in the products sold by thecompany, if it is required to pay for the damages that result. Although the company currently hasproduct liability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage and amount.Declines in value and other factors pertaining to the companys inventory could materiallyadversely affect its business.The electronic components and computer products industries are subject to rapid technologicalchange, evolving industry standards, changes in end-market demand and regulatory requirements,which can contribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of inventory. During an economicdownturn, it is possible that prices will decline due to an oversupply of product and, therefore,there may be greater risk of declines in inventory value. Although it is the policy of most of thecompanys suppliers to provide distributors with certain protections from the loss in value ofinventory (such as price protection, certain rights of return and rebates), the company cannot besure that such protections will fully compensate it for the loss in value, or that the supplierswill choose to, or be able to, honor such agreements. For example, many of the companys supplierswill not allow it to return products after they have been held in inventory beyond a certain amountof time and, in most instances, the return rights are limited to a certain percentage of the amountof product the company purchased in a particular time frame. In addition, as discussed below, thecompany historically has sold products that contain substances that are now or will soon beregulated by various environmental laws. Some of the companys inventory may become obsolete as aresult of these or other existing or new regulations. All of these factors pertaining to inventorycould have a material adverse effect on the companys business.The company is subject to environmental laws and regulations that could materially adversely affectits business.The company is subject to a wide and ever-changing variety of U.S. and foreign federal, state, andlocal laws and regulations, compliance with which may require substantial expense. Of particularnote are two recent European Union (EU) directives, known as the Restriction of Certain HazardousSubstances Directive (RoHS) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE).These directives restrict the distribution of products within the EU of certain substances andrequire a manufacturer or importer to recycle products containing those substances. Failure tocomply with these directives could result in fines or suspension of sales. Additionally, RoHS mayresult in the company having non-compliant inventory that may be less readily salable or have to bewritten off.In addition, some environmental laws impose liability, sometimes without fault, for investigatingor cleaning up contamination on or emanating from the companys currently or formerly owned, leasedor operated property, as well as for damages to property or natural resources and for personalinjury arising out of such contamination. As the distribution business, in general, does notinvolve the manufacture of products, it is typically not subject to significant liability in thisarea. However, there may be occasions, including through acquisitions, where environmentalliability arises. Such liability may be joint and several, meaning that the company could be held responsible for more than its share of the liability involved, or even theentire share. In addition, the presence of environmental contamination could also interfere withongoing operations or adversely affect the companys ability to sell or lease its properties. Thediscovery of contamination for which9Table of Contentsthe company is responsible, or the enactment of new laws andregulations, or changes in how existing requirements are enforced, could require the company toincur costs for compliance or subject it to unexpected liabilities.The foregoing matters could materially adversely affect the companys business.The company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of environmental problems attwo sites as a result of its Wyle Electronics acquisition, and the company is in litigation relatedto those sites.As a result of itsacquisition of Wyle Electronics from the VEBA Group (VEBA) in 2000, the company assumedWyles outstanding liabilities, including the responsibility for certain environmentalcontamination at sites formerly owned by Wyle. Two sites are known to have such contamination, oneat Norco, California, and the other at Huntsville, Alabama, and the company has thus far borne mostof the cost of the investigation and remediation of each, under the direction of the cognizantstate agencies. The company has expended more than $13 million to date in connection with thesesites. The company has also recently received and is reviewing a demand regarding allegedcontamination at a third site related to Wyle, in El Segundo, California.The agreement pursuant to which the company bought Wyle from VEBA contains an indemnification fromVEBA to the company for all of the costs associated with the Wyle environmental obligations.VEBAs successor-in-interest, E.ON AG, acknowledged liability under the VEBA contractualindemnities with respect to the Norco and Huntsville sites, and made a small initial payment, buthas subsequently refused to make further payments. As a result, the company has initiatedlitigation against E.ON AG and certain others in the United States District Court for the CentralDistrict of California and in the Regional Court in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. The companybelieves strongly in the merits of its case and the probability ofrecovery from E.ON AG, but therecan be no guaranty of the outcome of litigation, and should the company lose on all of its claimsin both cases, it would bear all of the cost of the Wyle environmental obligations. Becausecharacterization and remedial design is not yet complete at any of these sites, the future costs inexcess of accrued costs associated therewith are as yet undetermined and could have a materialadverse effect on the company. The company has accrued the minimum ofthe estimated range of costs associated with the Wyle environmentalobligations and, during the fourth quarter of 2005, has recorded a$10.3 million offset relating to the probable recovery of costs fromE.ON AG.In addition, the company is, along with other parties, a defendant in a suit filed by 91 plaintifflandowners and residents in Riverside County Court in California for personal injury and propertydamages allegedly caused by the contaminated groundwater and related soil-vapor found in certainresidential areas adjacent to the Norco site. Wyle Laboratories, formerly a division of WyleElectronics, has demanded defense and indemnification from the company in connection with thelitigation, and the company has, in turn demanded defense andindemnification from E.ON AG. Theclaims for indemnification are at issue in the U.S. District Court and Frankfurt Regional Courtproceedings.While the company believesstrongly in the merits of its claim for indemnification against E.ONAG,and has no reason to believe that the plaintiffs allegations of damages in the Norco matterpending in Riverside County have merit, there can be no guaranty regarding the outcome of eithermatter, and should the company be found to be liable for damages to the Riverside plaintiffs andE.ON AG found not to be liable to indemnify the company for those damages, it could have a materialadverse effect on the company.The company may not have adequate or cost-effective liquidity or capital resources.The company needs cash to make interest payments on and to refinance indebtedness, and for generalcorporate purposes, such as funding its ongoing working capital and capital expenditure needs. AtDecember 31, 2005, the company had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $580.7million. In addition, the company currently has access to credit lines in excess of $1.1 billion.The companys ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on its ability to generate cash fromoperations and to access the financial markets, both of which are subject to general economic,financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control.The company may in the future need to access the financial markets to satisfy its cash needs. Thecompanys ability to obtain external financing is affected by its debt ratings. Any increase inthe companys level of debt, change in status of its debt from unsecured to secured debt, ordeterioration of its operating results may cause a reduction in its current debt ratings. Anydowngrade in the companys current debt rating could impair the companys ability to obtainadditional financing on acceptable terms. Under the terms of any external financing, the company may incur higher than expected financing expenses and become subject toadditional10Table of Contentsrestrictions and covenants. For example, the companys existing debt agreements containrestrictive covenants, including covenants requiring compliance with specified financial ratios anda failure to comply with these or any other covenants may result in an event of default. Anincrease in the companys financing costs or a breach of debt instrument covenants could have amaterial adverse effect on the company.The agreements governing some of the companys financing arrangements contain various covenants andrestrictions that limit the discretion of management in operating the business and could preventthe company from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to its business.The agreements governing the companys financings contain various covenants and restrictions that,in certain circumstances, could limit its ability to:  grant liens on assets;   make restricted payments (including paying dividends on capital stock or redeeming orrepurchasing capital stock);   make investments;   merge, consolidate or transfer all orsubstantially all of its assets;   incur additional debt; or   engage in certain transactions withaffiliates.As a result of these covenants and restrictions, the company may be limited in how it conducts itsbusiness and may be unable to raise additional debt, compete effectively or make investments.The companys failure to have long-term sales contracts may have a material adverse effect on itsbusiness.Most of the companys sales are made on an order-by-order basis, rather than through long-termsales contracts. The company generally works with its customers to develop non-binding forecastsfor future volume of orders. Based on such nonbinding forecasts, the company makes commitmentsregarding the level of business that it will seek and accept, the inventory that it purchases, thetiming of production schedules, and the levels of utilization of personnel and other resources. Avariety of conditions, both specific to each customer and generally affecting each customersindustry, may cause customers to cancel, reduce or delay orders that were either previously made oranticipated. Generally, customers cancel, reduce or delay purchase orders and commitments withoutpenalty. The company seeks to mitigate these risks, in some cases, by entering intononcancelable/nonreturnable sales agreements, but there is no guaranty that such agreements willadequately protect the company. Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions or delays inorders by customers could materially adversely affect the companys business.The companys non-U.S. locations, particularly Asia, represent a significant and growing portion ofits sales, and consequently, the company is increasingly exposed to risks associated with operatinginternationally.In 2005, approximately 47% of the companys sales came from its operations outside the UnitedStates. During 2004 and 2003, approximately 46% of sales were from locations outside the UnitedStates. As a result of the companys foreign sales and locations, its operations are subject to avariety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:  import and export regulations that coulderode profit margins or restrict exports;   the burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties and technicalstandards and changes in those regulations;   potential restrictions on transfers offunds;   foreign currency fluctuations;   import and export duties and value addedtaxes;   transportation delays andinterruptions;   uncertainties arising from localbusiness practices and cultural considerations; and   potential military conflicts andpolitical risks.While the company has and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of lossesresulting from the risks of doing business abroad, it cannot ensure that such measures will beadequate.11Table of ContentsIn the event the company makes acquisitions, it may not be able to successfully integrate suchacquisitions or attain the anticipated benefits.While acquisitions no longer represent a major part of the companys core growth strategy, thecompany will continue to consider financially attractive and strategic acquisitions asopportunities arise. If the company is unsuccessful in integrating the acquisitions it does make,or if integration is more difficult than anticipated, the company may experience disruptions thatcould have a material adverse effect on its business. In addition, the company may not realize allof the benefits it anticipates from such acquisitions. For example, a certain portion of thepurchase price for most acquisitions is considered goodwill, an asset. In the event that anacquired company does not perform as anticipated, the value of the goodwill may have to be writtendown, which could have a material adverse effect on the company.If the company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discoversmaterial weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, it may not be able to reportits financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverseeffect on its business.An effective internal control environment is necessary for the company to produce reliablefinancial reports and is important in its effort to prevent financial fraud. The company isrequired to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internalcontrols over financial reporting. These evaluations may result in the conclusion thatenhancements, modifications or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable. Whilemanagement evaluates the effectiveness of the companys internal controls on a regular basis, thesecontrols may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness ofinternal controls including collusion, management override, and failure of human judgment. Inaddition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks. If thecompany fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or if management or thecompanys independent registered public accounting firm was to discover material weaknesses in thecompanys internal controls, it may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or preventfraud and it could have a material adverse effect on the companys business. In addition, thecompany may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as theSecurities and Exchange Commission or The New York Stock Exchange. Any such actions could resultin an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability ofthe companys financial statements, which could cause the market price of its common stock todecline or limit the companys access to other forms of capital.The Commerce Department may levy substantial fines on the company or may limit its ability toexport products.Under U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR), administered by the Bureau of Industry andSecurity of the Department of Commerce (BIS), licenses or proper license exceptions are requiredfor the shipment of certain U.S. goods and technology to certain countries, including China, India,Russia and other countries in which the company operates. Non-compliance with the ExportAdministration Regulations can result in a wide range of penalties including the denial of exportprivileges, fines, criminal penalties, and the seizure of commodities. In September 2004, thecompany made a preliminary, voluntary disclosure to the BIS advising them that it suspected thatits Hong Kong subsidiary, Arrow Asia Pac, Ltd., may have exported or re-exported certain productswithout the required licenses. The company performed a review of its historical shipments fromNorth America and the Asia/Pacific region to determine the number and nature of any violations. InMarch 2005, the company advised the BIS that it had identified 28 export or re-export shipments,over a five-year period, that may constitute violations of the EAR. The statutory maximum civilpenalty for each violation of the EAR identified is $11,000 for all but two of the shipments inquestion, which are subject to a higher statutory maximum civil penalty of $120,000 per violation.However, because it is not known whether the BIS will agree with the companys count orcharacterization of the violations, and because penalties for such violations may also includeexport prohibitions or restrictions, it is not possible at this time to determine the extent of thepenalties the company may incur. In the event that BIS views these shipments as violations of theEAR, the company could be fined significant sums and/or its export capabilities could berestricted. Such results could have a material adverse effect on the company.The company relies heavily on its internal information systems which, if not properlyfunctioning, could materially adversely affect the companys business.The companys current global operations reside on four separate technology platforms. Any of thesesystems are subject to electrical or telecommunications outages, computer hacking or other generalsystem failure. Moreover, the company recently initiated the design of a new global financialsystem. The implementation and12Table of Contentsinstallation of this system will be complicated and will take more than a year to finalize. Thereis no guarantee that the implementation will be successful or that there will not be integrationdifficulties that will adversely affect the companys operations or the accurate recording andreporting of financial data. Failure of its internal information systems or material difficultiesin upgrading its global financial system could have material adverse effects on the companysbusiness"
