8,ATRO,ASTRONICS CORP,2024-03-05,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSOur business faces many risks, and you should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this report, including the financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report, when deciding to invest in us. Any of the risks discussed below, or elsewhere in this report or in our other SEC filings, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in the future.Market RisksThe loss of Boeing as a major customer or a significant reduction in business with this customer would reduce our sales and earnings. In 2023, 2022, and 2021 we had a concentration of sales to Boeing representing approximately 11.0%, 11.0%, and 10.0% of our sales, respectively. Revenue earned from sales to Boeing may decline or fluctuate significantly in the future. We may not be able to offset any decline in sales from Boeing with sales from new customers or other existing customers. The loss of this customer or a significant reduction in business with them would significantly reduce our sales and earnings. Accordingly, a portion of our potential for success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage our relationship with Boeing.The markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions, conflicts and events, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate. The markets we serve are sensitive to fluctuations in general business cycles, global pandemics, domestic and foreign governmental tariffs, trade and monetary policies, national and international conflicts, and economic conditions and events, and are facing varying levels of supply chain pressures from the residual impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Domestic air travel has recovered from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and international travel utilizing primarily widebody aircraft is close to pre-pandemic levels. If a global health crisis, similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, we to occur in the future, we may find it difficult to access our existing financing or obtain additional financing and/or fund our operations and meet our debt service obligations. Any new pandemic or other future public health crisis, or a resurgence of COVID-19 or variants could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations.In our Aerospace segment, demand by the general aviation markets for our products is dependent upon several factors, including capital investment, product innovations, economic growth and wealth creation and technology upgrades. In addition, the commercial airline industry is highly cyclical with significant downturns in the past and sensitive to such things as fuel price increases, labor disputes, global economic conditions, availability of capital to fund new aircraft purchase and upgrades of existing aircraft and passenger demand. A change in any of these factors could result in a further reduction in the amount of air travel and the ability of airlines to invest in new aircraft or to upgrade existing aircraft. Therefore, our business is directly affected by economic factors and other trends that affect our customers in the commercial aerospace industry. These factors would reduce orders for new aircraft and would likely reduce airlines’ spending for cabin upgrades for which we supply 8products, thus reducing our sales and profits. A reduction in air travel may also result in our commercial airline customers being unable to pay our invoices on a timely basis or at all. We are a supplier on various new aircraft programs just entering or expected to begin production in the future. As with any new program, there is risk as to whether the aircraft or program will be successful and accepted by the market. As is customary for our business, we purchase inventory and invest in specific capital equipment to support our production requirements generally based on delivery schedules provided by our customer. If a program or aircraft is not successful, we may have to write-off all or a part of the inventory, accounts receivable and capital equipment related to the program. A write-off of these assets could result in a significant reduction of earnings and cause covenant violations relating to our debt agreements. This could result in our being unable to borrow additional funds under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our indebtedness.In our Test Systems segment, the market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment. In any one reporting period, a single customer or several customers may contribute an even larger percentage of our consolidated sales. In addition, our ability to increase sales will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers. The opportunities to obtain orders from these customers may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow sales. We expect that sales of our Test Systems products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future. Additionally, demand for some of our test products is dependent upon government funding levels for our products, our ability to compete successfully for those contracts and our ability to develop products to satisfy the demands of our customers.Our products are sold in highly competitive markets. Some of our competitors are larger, more diversified corporations and have greater financial, marketing, production and research and development resources than we do. As a result, they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns or other market changing events. Our operations and financial performance will be negatively impacted if our competitors:•develop products that are superior to our products;•develop products that are more competitively priced than our products;•develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services; or•adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.We believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality, price, design and engineering capabilities, product development, conformity to customer specifications, quality of support after the sale, timeliness of delivery and effectiveness of the distribution organization. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. If we do not maintain, or are otherwise unable to maintain, sufficient resources to make these investments, or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position, our business operations and financial performance will suffer.We depend on government contracts and subcontracts with defense prime contractors and subcontractors that may not be fully funded, may be terminated, or may be awarded to our competitors. The failure to be awarded these contracts, the failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales. Sales to the U.S. government and its prime contractors and subcontractors represent a significant portion of our business. The funding of these programs is generally subject to annual congressional appropriations, and congressional priorities are subject to change. We cannot be certain that current levels of congressional funding for programs involving our products or services will continue and that our business related to these products and services will not decline or increase at currently anticipated levels, or that we will not be subject to delays in the negotiation of contracts or increased costs due to changes in the funding of U.S. government programs or government shutdowns. In addition, government expenditures for defense programs may decline or these defense programs may be terminated. A decline in governmental expenditures, a change in spending priorities (e.g., shifting funds to assist Ukraine in the Russia and Ukraine conflict), or the termination of existing contracts may result in a reduction in the volume of contracts awarded to us. Furthermore, on contracts for which we are a subcontractor and not the prime contractor, the U.S. government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, irrespective of our performance as a subcontractor. Also, sales to the U.S. government and its contractors as well as foreign military and government customers, either directly or as a subcontractor to other contractors, often use a competitive bidding process and have unique purchasing and delivery requirements, which often makes the timing of sales to these customers unpredictable. We have resources applied to specific government contracts and if any of those contracts were terminated, we may incur substantial costs redeploying those resources.Contracting in the defense industry is subject to significant regulation, including rules related to bidding, billing and accounting kickbacks and false claims, and any non-compliance could subject us to fines and penalties or possible debarment. Like all government contractors, we are subject to risks associated with this contracting. These risks include the 9potential for substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation, which could significantly reduce our sales and earnings. It could also result in our suspension or debarment from future government contracts, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Strategic RisksIf we are unable to adapt to technological change, demand for our products may be reduced. The technologies related to our products have undergone, and in the future may undergo, significant changes. To succeed in the future, we will need to continue to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so successfully, if at all, or on a timely, cost effective, or repeatable basis. Our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we develop or that render our technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive. Furthermore, our products could become unmarketable if new industry standards emerge. We may have to modify our products significantly in the future to remain competitive, and new products we introduce may not be accepted by our customers.Our new product development efforts may not be successful, which would result in a reduction in our sales and earnings. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development of new products or product enhancements, and new products or product enhancements may not be accepted by our customers. Because it is generally not possible to predict the amount of time required and the costs involved in achieving certain research, development, and engineering objectives, the development expenses we incur may exceed our cost estimates and estimated product development schedules may be extended. Furthermore, any new products we develop may not generate sales sufficient to offset our costs. If any of these events occur, our sales and profits could be adversely affected.We may incur losses and liabilities as a result of our acquisition strategy. Growth by acquisition involves risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results, including:•the potential exposure to unanticipated liabilities;•the potential that expected benefits or synergies are not realized and that operating costs increase;•the risks associated with incurring additional acquisition indebtedness, including that additional indebtedness could limit our cash flow availability for operations and our flexibility;•difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies;•the potential loss of key employees, suppliers or customers of acquired businesses; and•diversion of management time and attention from our core business.In addition, any acquisition, once successfully integrated, could negatively impact our financial performance if it does not perform as planned, does not increase earnings, or does not prove otherwise to be beneficial to us.Operational RisksOur business and operations could be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology infrastructure or adversely impacted by a successful cyber-attack. We are dependent on various information technologies throughout our Company to administer, store and support multiple business activities. We routinely experience various cybersecurity threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure, unauthorized attempts to gain access to our Company sensitive information, and denial-of-service attacks as do our customers, suppliers and subcontractors. We conduct regular periodic training of our employees as to the protection of sensitive information which includes security awareness training intended to prevent the success of “phishing” attacks. The threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries, such as ransomware attacks to disable critical infrastructure and extort companies for ransom payments, to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, including nation states, which target us and other defense contractors because we protect sensitive information. If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures, and depending on the severity of the incident, our customers’ data, our employees’ data, our intellectual property, and other third-party data (such as subcontractors, suppliers and vendors) could be compromised. As a consequence of their persistence, sophistication and volume, we may not be successful in defending against all such attacks. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.10Although we work cooperatively with our customers, suppliers, and subcontractors to seek to minimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by these entities, which may affect the security of our information. These entities have varying levels of cybersecurity expertise and safeguards and their relationships with U.S. government contractors, such as Astronics, may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber threats we face. If we experience a data security breach from an external source or from an insider threat, we may have a loss in sales or increased costs arising from the restoration or implementation of additional security measures, either of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. Other potential costs could include damage to our reputation, loss of brand value, incident response costs, loss of stock market value, regulatory inquiries, litigation and management distraction. A security breach that involves classified information could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, loss of a government contract, loss of access to classified information, or debarment as a government contractor. Similarly, a breach that involves loss of customer-provided data could subject us to loss of a customer, loss of a contract, litigation costs and legal damages and reputational harm.Our inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property or defend against assertions of infringement could prevent or restrict our ability to compete. We rely on patents, trademarks and proprietary knowledge and technology, both internally developed and acquired, in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Our inability to defend against the unauthorized use of these rights and assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the United States or abroad will be adequate, or that others will not develop technologies similar or superior to our technology or design around our proprietary rights. Litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against claims of infringement. This litigation could result in significant costs and divert our management’s focus away from operations. Refer to the risk factor related to pending patent infringement litigation below and Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report for further discussion.If critical components or raw materials used to manufacture our products or used in our development programs become scarce or unavailable, then we may incur delays in manufacturing and delivery of our products and in completing our development programs, which has damaged, and could continue to damage, our business, results of operations and financial condition. Due to increased demand across a range of industries, the global supply chain for certain critical components or raw materials used in the manufacture of our products and used in our development programs has experienced, and may in future periods experience, significant strain in recent periods. Residual impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have contributed to and exacerbated this strain to varying degrees. This constrained supply environment has adversely affected, and could further affect, availability, lead times and the cost of components, and could impact our ability to timely complete development programs, respond to accelerated or quick-turn delivery requests from customers, or meet customer demand and product delivery dates for our end customers in situations where we cannot timely secure adequate supply of these components. Moreover, if any of our suppliers become financially unstable, or otherwise unable or unwilling to provide us with raw materials or components, then we may have to find new suppliers. It may take several months to locate alternative suppliers, if required, or to redesign our products to accommodate components from different suppliers. We may experience significant delays in manufacturing and shipping our products to customers and incur additional development, manufacturing and other costs to establish alternative sources of supply if we lose any of these sources or are required to redesign our products. We cannot predict if we will be able to obtain replacement components within the time frames that we require at an acceptable cost, if at all. In an effort to mitigate these risks, in some cases, we have incurred higher costs to secure available inventory, or have extended or placed non-cancellable purchase commitments with suppliers, which introduces inventory risk if our forecasts and assumptions prove inaccurate. While we may attempt to recover the increased costs through price increases to our customers, we may be unable to mitigate the effect on our results of operations. We have also multi-sourced and pre-ordered components and raw materials inventory in some cases in an effort to reduce the impact of the adverse supply chain conditions we have experienced. Despite our attempts to mitigate the impact on our business, these constrained supply conditions are expected to adversely impact our costs of goods sold, including our ability to continue to reduce the cost to produce our products in a manner consistent with prior periods. In addition, some suppliers have indicated that, as a result of current shortages, they intend to cease manufacture of certain components used in our products. Limits on manufacturing availability or capacity or delays in production or delivery of components or raw materials could further delay or inhibit our ability to obtain supply of components and produce finished goods. These supply chain constraints and their related challenges could result in shortages, increased material costs or use of cash, engineering design changes, and delays in new product introductions, each of which could adversely impact our growth, gross margin and financial results. These types of negative financial impacts on our business may become more acute if supply chain pressures increase.Our financial results could continue to be adversely impacted by the escalation of labor and benefit costs. Consistent with the experience of other employers, our labor, medical and workers’ compensation costs have increased substantially in recent 11years and are expected to continue to rise. If this trend continues, the cost of labor and to provide healthcare and other benefits to our employees could continue to increase, adversely impacting our future profitability. Competition for employees has escalated in the labor market which has increased costs associated with attracting and retaining employees. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently or that our labor costs will not increase as a result of a shortage in the availability of skilled employees. Changes to healthcare regulations involving the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may also increase the cost of providing such benefits to our employees. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing, or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation or related proposals and policies on our results. Any significant increases in the costs attributable to our self-insured health and workers’ compensation plans could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Price inflation for labor and materials, further exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine or the Israel-Hamas war, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have experienced considerable price inflation in our costs for labor and materials in recent years, which has adversely affected our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may not be able to pass through inflationary cost increases under our existing fixed-price contracts. Our ability to raise prices to reflect increased costs may be limited by competitive conditions in the market for our products and services. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, and prolonged conflict in either such situation, may continue to result in increased inflation, escalating energy and commodity prices and increasing costs of materials. We continue to work to mitigate such pressures on our business operations as they develop. To the extent the war in Ukraine or the Israel-Hamas war adversely affects our business as discussed above, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein, such as those relating to cybersecurity, supply chain, volatility in prices and market conditions, any of which could negatively affect our business and financial condition.If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, our prime contract performance and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted. Many of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor. Failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide, on a timely basis, the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations with our customer and could result in the assessment of late delivery penalties. Subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders.Some of our contracts contain late delivery penalties. Failure to deliver in a timely manner due to supplier and supply chain problems, labor availability, development schedule slides, manufacturing difficulties, or similar schedule-related events could have a material adverse effect on our business. No significant penalties have been incurred to date.Our results of operations are affected by our fixed-price contracts, which could subject us to losses in the event that we have cost overruns. For the year ended December 31, 2023, fixed-price contracts represented almost all of the Company’s sales. On fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the scope of work specified in the contract for a predetermined price. Depending on the fixed price negotiated, these contracts may provide us with an opportunity to achieve higher profits based on the relationship between our costs and the contract’s fixed price. However, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit or cause us to incur a loss on the contract, which would reduce our net earnings. Because our ability to terminate contracts is generally limited, we may not be able to terminate our performance requirements under these contracts at all or without substantial liability and, therefore, in the event we are sustaining reduced profits or losses, we could continue to sustain these reduced profits or losses for the duration of the contract term. The failure of our products may damage our reputation, necessitate a product recall or result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages. Defects in the design and manufacture of our products may necessitate a product recall. We include complex system design and components in our products that could contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products. If any of our products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. Such an event could result in significant expenses, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products. We are also exposed to product liability claims. We carry aircraft and non-aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms. However, this insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover the payment of any potential claim. Additionally, should insurance market conditions change, aircraft and non-aircraft product liability insurance coverage may not be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us. A product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our operations depend on our manufacturing facilities, which are subject to physical and other risks that could disrupt production. Our manufacturing facilities or our customers' facilities could be damaged or disrupted by a natural disaster, war, 12or terrorist activity. We maintain property damage and business interruption insurance at the levels typical in our industry or for our customers and suppliers, however, a pandemic or other major catastrophe, such as an earthquake, hurricane, fire, flood, tornado or other natural disaster at any of our sites, or war or terrorist activities in any of the areas where we conduct operations could result in a prolonged interruption of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers, and we may not have insurance to adequately compensate us for any of these events. For leased facilities, timely renewal of leases and risk mitigation from the sale of our leased facilities is required to avoid any business interruption.We may be subject to work stoppages at our facilities or those of our principal customers and suppliers, which could seriously impact the profitability of our business. Many aircraft manufacturers, airlines, and aerospace suppliers have unionized work forces. Any strikes, work stoppages, or slowdowns experienced by aircraft manufacturers, airlines, or aerospace suppliers could reduce our customers’ demand for additional aircraft structures or prevent us from completing production of our products.A small percentage of our workforce is represented by unions. If we were unable to renew our labor agreements at expiration, or if our workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, we could experience a disruption of our operations, which could cause us to be unable to deliver products to certain of our customers on a timely basis and could result in a breach of such supply agreements. This could negatively impact our results. In addition, our non-unionized labor force may become subject to labor union organizing efforts, which could cause us to incur additional labor costs and increase the related risks that we now face.The construction of aircraft is heavily regulated, and failure to comply with applicable laws could reduce our sales or require us to incur additional costs to achieve compliance, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with new or more stringent governmental regulation. The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the United States by the FAA and in other countries by similar agencies. We must be certified by the FAA and, in some cases, by individual OEMs in order to engineer and service parts, components and aerostructures used in specific aircraft models. If any of our material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended, our operations would be adversely affected. New or more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted, or industry oversight heightened in the future, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or any heightened industry oversight. In addition, in January 2024, the FAA ordered the temporary grounding of Boeing 737-9 MAX aircraft as a result of an incident where a Boeing 737-9 MAX lost a “door plug.” This incident and the subsequent investigation, and the potential for more issues to be identified during further investigations, could result in a suspension or reduction of manufacturing of 737 MAX aircraft by Boeing. Air travelers may also respond negatively to the 737 MAX aircraft due to perceived safety concerns, which would negatively impact Boeing. Boeing is a major customer of ours and any financial or customer losses it suffers may result in a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Financial RisksWe have incurred losses in prior fiscal years and our future profitability is not certain. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred net loss of $26.4 million. Our operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and we cannot be certain that we will be profitable or that we will not experience substantial net losses in the future. If we are not able to increase revenue or reduce our costs, we may not be able to achieve profitability in future periods and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility contain financial and restrictive covenants that we may be unable to satisfy, and that, if not satisfied, could result in the acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness thereunder and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the terms of our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility contain covenants that restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to take certain actions. Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility each subject us to various financial and other affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply on an ongoing or periodic basis. These include financial covenants pertaining to minimum trailing four quarter EBITDA requirements, minimum liquidity requirements, minimum fixed charge coverage ratio requirements, maximum capital expenditure requirements, and excess cash flow repayment provisions. An unexpected decline in our revenues or operating income, including occurring as a result of events beyond our control, could cause us to violate our financial covenants. A covenant violation could result in a default under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility. If any such default occurs, the lenders may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. Further, as the amount available to us under our credit facilities is subject to borrowing base calculations determined by the value of accounts receivable and inventory (under our ABL Revolving Credit Facility) and real estate and fixed assets (under our Term Loan Facility), an unexpected decline in the value of these assets would require a mandatory prepayment. If any of these events were to occur, we may not be able to pay our debts and other monetary obligations as they come due, and our ability to continue to 13operate as a going concern could be impaired, which could in turn cause a significant decline in our stock price and could result in a significant loss of value for our shareholders. Furthermore, the lenders also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings, which could leave us without access to sufficient liquidity to operate our business. In addition, following an event of default, the lenders under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which includes our available accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, real estate and intellectual property. If the debt under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt. Additionally, our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility also contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on the Company and our subsidiaries and may limit our ability to engage in acts that we believe to be in our long-term best interests. The ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility include covenants restricting, among other things, the ability of the Company and our subsidiaries to: •incur additional indebtedness;•pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock;•make certain acquisitions or investments;•sell assets; and•engage in certain business activities.The amount of debt we have outstanding, as well as any debt we may incur in the future, could have an adverse effect on our operational and financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $172.5 million of debt outstanding. Changes to our level of debt subsequent to December 31, 2023 could have significant consequences to our business, including the following:•Depending on interest rates and debt maturities, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to paying principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for our acquisition strategy, capital expenditures or other purposes;•A significant amount of additional debt could make us more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions or increases in prevailing interest rates;•Our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, capital expenditures or for other purposes could be impaired;•The increase in the amount of debt we have outstanding and the associated interest expense increases the risk of non-compliance with some of the covenants in our debt agreements which require us to maintain specified financial ratios; and•We may be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may result in a competitive disadvantage.Subject to the limits contained in our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks described above related to our debt could intensify.We are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks that could adversely affect our business, liquidity and operating results. Changes in the availability, terms and cost of capital, and increases in interest rates could cause our cost of doing business to increase and place us at a competitive disadvantage. At December 31, 2023, all of our debt was subject to variable interest rates.A write-off of all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our operating results and net worth. At December 31, 2023, goodwill and net intangible assets were approximately 9.2% and 10.3% of our total assets, respectively. We had no goodwill impairment charges during 2023, 2022 or 2021. Our goodwill and other intangible assets may increase in the future since our strategy includes growing through acquisitions. We may have to write-off all or part of our goodwill or purchased intangible assets if their value becomes impaired. Although this write-off would not result in an outlay of cash and is not included in the financial covenant calculation, it could reduce our earnings and net worth significantly.Our future operating results could be impacted by estimates used to calculate impairment losses on goodwill and long-lived assets. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant and subjective estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of tangible and intangible long-lived assets, including goodwill, in the financial statements. These estimates are integral in the determination of whether a potential non-cash impairment loss exists as well as the calculation of that loss. Actual future results could differ from those estimates. We had no such asset impairment charges in 2023, 2022 or 2021.Changes in discount rates and other estimates could affect our future earnings and equity. Our goodwill asset impairment evaluations are determined using valuations that involve several assumptions, including discount rates, cash flow estimates, 14growth rates and terminal values. Certain of these assumptions, particularly the discount rate, are based on market conditions and are outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity.Additionally, pension obligations and the related costs are determined using actual results and actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions. The most critical assumption is the discount rate. Other assumptions include mortality, salary and bonus levels and retirement age. The discount rate assumptions are based on current market conditions and are outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity. Changes in tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results. Changes in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those with retroactive effect, could result in increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows. For example, beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years for tax purposes. The most significant impact of this provision is to the cash tax liability for 2023 (as the liability for 2022 is partially offset by certain tax credits and loss carryforwards); the impact will decline annually thereafter over the five-year amortization period to an immaterial amount in year six.Legal and Compliance RisksWe currently are involved in, and may become involved in the future in, legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could materially and adversely impact our financial condition. As an aerospace company, we may become a party to litigation, including, among others, matters alleging product liability, warranty claims, intellectual property infringement, breach of commercial or government contract or other legal actions. In general, litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.Currently, our AES subsidiary is a defendant in actions filed in various jurisdictions by Lufthansa Technik AG relating to an allegation of patent infringement and based on rulings to date we have concluded that losses related to these proceedings are probable. If these actions are decided adversely against the Company, the associated damages could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Refer to Note 19 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report for discussion on this and other legal proceedings. Other than these proceedings, we are not party to any significant pending legal proceedings that management believes will result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Our operations in foreign countries expose us to political and currency risks and adverse changes in local legal and regulatory environments. In 2023, approximately 10% of our sales were made by our subsidiaries in foreign countries, predominately in our subsidiaries in France and Canada. Net assets held by our foreign subsidiaries total $39.1 million at December 31, 2023. Approximately 25% of our consolidated sales in 2023 were made to customers outside of the United States. Our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies and by the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local currencies into U.S. dollars. We expect international operations and export sales to continue to contribute to our earnings for the foreseeable future. Both the sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside of the U.S. Such risks include the possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations, changes in tariff and trade barriers and import or export licensing requirements, and political or economic reprioritization, insurrection, civil disturbance or war.Government regulations could limit our ability to sell our products outside the U.S. and could otherwise adversely affect our business. Certain of our sales are subject to compliance with U.S. export regulations. Our failure to obtain, or fully adhere to the limitations contained in, the requisite licenses, meet registration standards or comply with other government export regulations would hinder our ability to generate sales of our products outside the U.S. Compliance with these government regulations may also subject us to additional fees and operating costs. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In order to sell our products in European Union countries, we must satisfy certain technical requirements. If we are unable to comply with those requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products, our sales in Europe would be restricted. Doing business internationally also subjects us to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, foreign corrupt practices and anti-boycott provisions. Our failure, or failure by an authorized agent or representative that is attributable to us, to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in monetary penalties, suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which would have a material adverse effect on us.15Trade policies, treaties, and tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business is dependent on the availability of raw materials and components for our products, particularly electrical components common in the semiconductor industry. There is continued uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and various other countries, most significantly China, with respect to trade policies, treaties, tariffs, and taxes. Changes in U.S. administrative policy could lead to changes in existing trade agreements, greater restrictions on free trade generally, and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States, particularly tariffs on products manufactures in China and Mexico, among other possible changes. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, could have a material effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and could significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between the impacted nations and the United States.This uncertainty includes: (i) the possibility of altering the existing tariffs or penalties on products manufactured outside the United States, including the U.S. government’s 25% tariff on a range of products from China; (ii) the effects stemming from the removal of such previously imposed tariffs; (iii) subsequent tariffs imposed by the United States on any other U.S. trading partners such as Russia; and (iv) potential tariffs imposed by trading partners on U.S. goods. The institution of trade tariffs on items imported by us from other countries could increase our costs, which could have a negative impact on our business.We cannot predict whether, and to what extent, there may be changes to international trade agreements or whether quotas, duties, tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions on our products will be changed or imposed. In addition, an open conflict or war across any region could affect our ability to obtain raw materials. For example, the current military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and related sanctions, export controls or other actions that may be initiated by nations, including the United States, the European Union or Russia (e.g., potential cyberattacks, disruption of energy flows, etc.) or potential sanctions or relevant export controls related to China or Taiwan could adversely affect our business and/or our supply chain or our business partners or customers in other countries beyond Russia and Ukraine. Although we currently maintain alternative sources for raw materials, if we are unable to source our products from the countries where we wish to purchase them, either because of the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts, regulatory changes or for any other reason, or if the cost of doing so increases, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Disruptions in the supply of raw materials and components could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers or require us to pay higher prices to obtain these raw materials or components from other sources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations.We may face reputational, regulatory or financial risks from a perceived, or an actual, failure to achieve our sustainability goals. The increased focus on sustainability practices and disclosures is rapidly evolving, as is the criteria to measure our sustainability performance; both of which could result in greater expectations and may cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy the evolving criteria. As we advance our sustainable business model, we are pursuing programs that we believe will improve our environmental practices, social engagement and how we govern ourselves. We periodically publish information about our sustainability goals, standards and frameworks. Achievement of these objectives is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our direct control, and it is possible we may fail, or be perceived to have failed, in the achievement of our sustainability goals. Also, certain customers, associates, shareholders, investors, suppliers, business partners, government agencies and non-governmental organizations may not be satisfied with our sustainability efforts. A failure or perceived failure of our sustainability goals could negatively affect our reputation and our results of operations.We are subject to extensive regulation and audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. The accuracy and appropriateness of certain costs and expenses used to substantiate our direct and indirect costs for the U.S. Government contracts are subject to extensive regulation and audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency, an arm of the U.S. Department of Defense (“USDOD”). Such audits and reviews could result in adjustments to our contract costs and profitability. However, we cannot ensure the outcome of any future audits and adjustments may be required to reduce net sales or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. If any audit or review were to uncover inaccurate costs or improper activities, we could be subject to penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from conducting future business with the U.S. Government. Any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.We are subject to the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual for facility security clearance, which is a prerequisite for our ability to perform on classified contracts for the U.S. Government. USDOD facility security clearance is required in order to be awarded and be able to perform on classified contracts for the USDOD and certain other agencies of the U.S. Government, which is a significant part of our business. We have obtained clearance at appropriate levels that require stringent qualifications, and we may be required to seek higher level clearances in the future. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our security clearance. If for some reason our security clearance is invalidated or terminated, we may not be able to continue to perform our present classified contracts or be able to enter into new classified contracts, which could affect our ability to compete for and capture new business.16Our business is subject to regulation in the United States and internationally. The manufacturing of our products is subject to numerous federal, state and foreign governmental regulations. The number of laws and regulations that are being enacted or proposed by various governmental bodies and authorities is increasing. Compliance with these regulations is difficult and expensive. If we fail to adhere, or are alleged to have failed to adhere, to any applicable federal, state, or foreign laws or regulations, or if such laws or regulations negatively affect sales of our products, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, our future results could be adversely affected by changes in applicable federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, including those relating to manufacturing processes, product liability, government contracts, trade rules and customs regulations, intellectual property, consumer laws, privacy laws, environmental protection, climate change, as well as accounting standards and taxation requirements (including tax-rate changes, new tax laws or revised tax law interpretations).General RisksOur future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team and technical personnel. The loss of members of our management team could have a material and adverse effect on our business. In addition, competition for qualified technical personnel in our industry is intense, and we believe that our future growth and success will depend on our ability to attract, train and retain such personnel.Future terror attacks, war, or other civil disturbances could negatively impact our business. Continued terror attacks, war or other disturbances could lead to economic instability and decreases in demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Terrorist attacks world-wide have caused instability from time to time in global financial markets and the aviation industry. The long-term effects of terrorist attacks on us are unknown. These attacks and the U.S. government’s continued efforts against terrorist organizations may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the U.S. or elsewhere, which may further contribute to economic instability.If we fail to meet expectations of securities analysts or investors due to fluctuations in our sales or operating results, our stock price could decline significantly. Our sales and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including delays or cancellations of programs and supply chain challenges on revenues and costs. It is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. In this event, the trading price of our stock could decline significantly.Our stock price is volatile. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our stock price ranged from a low of $10.14 to a high of $22.01. The price of our common stock has been and likely will continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of events and factors, such as:•our ability to comply with the financial and other affirmative and negative covenants included in our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility;•quarterly variations in operating results;•variances of our quarterly results of operations from securities analyst estimates;•changes in financial estimates;•announcements of technological innovations and new products;•news reports relating to trends in our markets or adverse happenings at our customers;•the cancellation of major contracts or programs with our customers; and•residual impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the aerospace industry and our Company.In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for companies in the aerospace and defense industry in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies affected by these fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Global health crises, similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the breadth of its impact worldwide, and particularly on the aerospace industry, could also cause significant volatility in the market price"
12,ATRO,ASTRONICS CORP,2023-03-10,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSOur business faces many risks, and you should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this report, including the financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8 of this report, when deciding to invest in us. Any of the risks discussed below, or elsewhere in this report or in our other SEC filings, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in the future.Market RisksThe loss of Boeing or Panasonic as major customers or a significant reduction in business with either of those customers would reduce our sales and earnings. In 2022 and 2021, we had a concentration of sales to Boeing representing approximately 11.0% and 10.0% of our sales, respectively. In 2020, we also had a concentration of sales to Panasonic representing approximately 11.1% of our sales. Revenue earned from sales to Boeing or Panasonic may decline or fluctuate significantly in the future. We may not be able to offset any decline in sales from Boeing or Panasonic with sales from new customers or other existing customers. The loss of these customers or a significant reduction in business with them would significantly reduce our sales and earnings. Accordingly, a portion of our potential for success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage our relationships with Boeing and Panasonic.The markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions, conflicts and events, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate. The markets we serve are sensitive to fluctuations in general business cycles, global pandemics, domestic and foreign governmental tariffs, trade and monetary policies, national and international conflicts, and economic conditions and events, and are facing varying levels of pressure from the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic drastically reduced air traffic as travel restrictions and social distancing measures were implemented to help control the spread of the virus. While U.S. domestic air travel has recovered, international travel utilizing wide-body aircraft will take longer to fully recover. Furthermore, as companies and employees become accustomed to working remotely, business travel and the associated flight hours may not reach the pre-pandemic levels. As such, OEMs may continue to directionally match their wide-body aircraft production rates with the reduced, albeit recovering, air traffic volume, which could lower demand for our products. If the pandemic worsens or there is significant uncertainty in the commercial aerospace industry’s recovery, we may find it difficult to access our existing financing or obtain additional financing and/or fund our operations and meet our debt service obligations.In our Aerospace segment, demand by the general aviation markets for our products is dependent upon several factors, including capital investment, product innovations, economic growth and wealth creation and technology upgrades. In addition, the commercial airline industry is highly cyclical with significant downturns in the past and sensitive to such things as fuel price increases, labor disputes, global economic conditions, availability of capital to fund new aircraft purchase and upgrades of existing aircraft and passenger demand. A change in any of these factors could result in a further reduction in the amount of air travel and the ability of airlines to invest in new aircraft or to upgrade existing aircraft. Therefore, our business is directly affected by economic factors and other trends that affect our customers in the commercial aerospace industry. These factors would reduce orders for new aircraft and would likely reduce airlines’ spending for cabin upgrades for which we supply products, thus reducing our sales and profits. A reduction in air travel may also result in our commercial airline customers being unable to pay our invoices on a timely basis or at all. We are a supplier on various new aircraft programs just entering or expected to begin production in the future. As with any new program, there is risk as to whether the aircraft or program will be successful and accepted by the market. As is customary for our business, we purchase inventory and invest in specific capital equipment to support our production requirements generally based on delivery schedules provided by our customer. If a program or aircraft is not successful, we may have to write-off all or a part of the inventory, accounts receivable and capital equipment related to the program. A write-off of these assets could result in a significant reduction of earnings and cause covenant violations relating to our debt agreements. This could result in our being unable to borrow additional funds under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our indebtedness.In our Test Systems segment, the market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment. In any one reporting period, a single customer or several customers may contribute an even larger percentage of our consolidated sales. In addition, our ability to increase sales will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers. The opportunities to obtain orders from these customers may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow sales. We expect that sales of our Test Systems products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future. Additionally, demand for some of our test products is dependent upon government funding levels for our products, our ability to compete successfully for those contracts and our ability to develop products to satisfy the demands of our customers.9Our products are sold in highly competitive markets. Some of our competitors are larger, more diversified corporations and have greater financial, marketing, production and research and development resources than we do. As a result, they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns or other market changing events. Our operations and financial performance will be negatively impacted if our competitors:•develop products that are superior to our products;•develop products that are more competitively priced than our products;•develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services; or•adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.We believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality, price, design and engineering capabilities, product development, conformity to customer specifications, quality of support after the sale, timeliness of delivery and effectiveness of the distribution organization. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. If we do not maintain, or are otherwise unable to maintain, sufficient resources to make these investments, or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position, our business operations and financial performance will suffer.We depend on government contracts and subcontracts with defense prime contractors and subcontractors that may not be fully funded, may be terminated, or may be awarded to our competitors. The failure to be awarded these contracts, the failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales. Sales to the U.S. government and its prime contractors and subcontractors represent a significant portion of our business. The funding of these programs is generally subject to annual congressional appropriations, and congressional priorities are subject to change. We cannot be certain that current levels of congressional funding for programs involving our products or services will continue and that our business related to these products and services will not decline or increase at currently anticipated levels, or that we will not be subject to delays in the negotiation of contracts or increased costs due to changes in the funding of U.S. government programs or government shutdowns. In addition, government expenditures for defense programs may decline or these defense programs may be terminated. A decline in governmental expenditures, a change in spending priorities (e.g., shifting funds to efforts to combat the impact of the pandemic or efforts to assist Ukraine in the Russia and Ukraine conflict), or the termination of existing contracts may result in a reduction in the volume of contracts awarded to us. Furthermore, on contracts for which we are a subcontractor and not the prime contractor, the U.S. government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, irrespective of our performance as a subcontractor. Also, sales to the U.S. government and its contractors as well as foreign military and government customers, either directly or as a subcontractor to other contractors, often use a competitive bidding process and have unique purchasing and delivery requirements, which often makes the timing of sales to these customers unpredictable. We have resources applied to specific government contracts and if any of those contracts were terminated, we may incur substantial costs redeploying those resources.Contracting in the defense industry is subject to significant regulation, including rules related to bidding, billing and accounting kickbacks and false claims, and any non-compliance could subject us to fines and penalties or possible debarment. Like all government contractors, we are subject to risks associated with this contracting. These risks include the potential for substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation, which could significantly reduce our sales and earnings. It could also result in our suspension or debarment from future government contracts, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Strategic RisksIf we are unable to adapt to technological change, demand for our products may be reduced. The technologies related to our products have undergone, and in the future may undergo, significant changes. To succeed in the future, we will need to continue to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so successfully, if at all, or on a timely, cost effective, or repeatable basis. Our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we develop or that render our technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive. Furthermore, our products could become unmarketable if new industry standards emerge. We may have to modify our products significantly in the future to remain competitive, and new products we introduce may not be accepted by our customers.Our new product development efforts may not be successful, which would result in a reduction in our sales and earnings. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development of new products or product 10enhancements, and new products or product enhancements may not be accepted by our customers. Because it is generally not possible to predict the amount of time required and the costs involved in achieving certain research, development, and engineering objectives, the development expenses we incur may exceed our cost estimates and estimated product development schedules may be extended. Furthermore, any new products we develop may not generate sales sufficient to offset our costs. If any of these events occur, our sales and profits could be adversely affected.We may incur losses and liabilities as a result of our acquisition strategy. Growth by acquisition involves risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results, including:•the potential exposure to unanticipated liabilities;•the potential that expected benefits or synergies are not realized and that operating costs increase;•the risks associated with incurring additional acquisition indebtedness, including that additional indebtedness could limit our cash flow availability for operations and our flexibility;•difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies;•the potential loss of key employees, suppliers or customers of acquired businesses; and•diversion of management time and attention from our core business.In addition, any acquisition, once successfully integrated, could negatively impact our financial performance if it does not perform as planned, does not increase earnings, or does not prove otherwise to be beneficial to us.Operational RisksOur business and operations could be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology infrastructure or adversely impacted by a successful cyber-attack. We are dependent on various information technologies throughout our Company to administer, store and support multiple business activities. We routinely experience various cybersecurity threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure, unauthorized attempts to gain access to our Company sensitive information, and denial-of-service attacks as do our customers, suppliers and subcontractors. We conduct regular periodic training of our employees as to the protection of sensitive information which includes security awareness training intended to prevent the success of “phishing” attacks. The threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries, such as ransomware attacks to disable critical infrastructure and extort companies for ransom payments, to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, including nation states, which target us and other defense contractors because we protect sensitive information. If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures, and depending on the severity of the incident, our customers’ data, our employees’ data, our intellectual property, and other third-party data (such as subcontractors, suppliers and vendors) could be compromised. As a consequence of their persistence, sophistication and volume, we may not be successful in defending against all such attacks. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.Although we work cooperatively with our customers, suppliers, and subcontractors to seek to minimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by these entities, which may affect the security of our information. These entities have varying levels of cybersecurity expertise and safeguards and their relationships with U.S. government contractors, such as Astronics, may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber threats we face. If we experience a data security breach from an external source or from an insider threat, we may have a loss in sales or increased costs arising from the restoration or implementation of additional security measures, either of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. Other potential costs could include damage to our reputation, loss of brand value, incident response costs, loss of stock market value, regulatory inquiries, litigation and management distraction. A security breach that involves classified information could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, loss of a government contract, loss of access to classified information, or debarment as a government contractor. Similarly, a breach that involves loss of customer-provided data could subject us to loss of a customer, loss of a contract, litigation costs and legal damages and reputational harm.Our inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property or defend against assertions of infringement could prevent or restrict our ability to compete. We rely on patents, trademarks and proprietary knowledge and technology, both internally developed and acquired, in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Our inability to defend against the unauthorized use of these rights and assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the United States or abroad will be adequate, or that others will not develop technologies similar or superior to our technology or design around our proprietary rights. Litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against claims of infringement. This litigation could result in significant costs and divert our management’s focus away from operations. Refer to the risk factor related to pending patent 11infringement litigation below and Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report for further discussion.If critical components or raw materials used to manufacture our products or used in our development programs become scarce or unavailable, then we may incur delays in manufacturing and delivery of our products and in completing our development programs, which has damaged, and could continue to damage, our business, results of operations and financial condition. Due to increased demand across a range of industries, the global supply chain for certain critical components or raw materials used in the manufacture of our products and used in our development programs has experienced significant strain in recent periods. Particularly, the market for electronic components is experiencing increased demand, creating substantial uncertainty regarding our suppliers’ continued production of key components for our products. The COVID-19 pandemic has also contributed to and exacerbated this strain. This constrained supply environment has adversely affected, and could further affect, availability, lead times and cost of components, and could impact our ability to complete development programs, respond to accelerated or quick-turn delivery requests from customers, or meet customer demand and product delivery dates for our end customers where we cannot timely secure adequate supply of these components. Moreover, if any of our suppliers become financially unstable, or otherwise unable or unwilling to provide us with raw materials or components, then we may have to find new suppliers. It may take several months to locate alternative suppliers, if required, or to redesign our products to accommodate components from different suppliers. We may experience significant delays in manufacturing and shipping our products to customers and incur additional development, manufacturing and other costs to establish alternative sources of supply if we lose any of these sources or are required to redesign our products. We cannot predict if we will be able to obtain replacement components within the time frames that we require at an acceptable cost, if at all. In an effort to mitigate these risks, in some cases, we have incurred higher costs to secure available inventory, or have extended or placed non-cancellable purchase commitments with suppliers, which introduces inventory risk if our forecasts and assumptions prove inaccurate. While we may attempt to recover the increased costs through price increases to our customers, we may be unable to mitigate the effect on our results of operations. We have also multi-sourced and pre-ordered components and raw materials inventory in some cases in an effort to reduce the impact of the adverse supply chain conditions we have experienced. Despite our attempts to mitigate the impact on our business, these constrained supply conditions are expected to adversely impact our costs of goods sold, including our ability to continue to reduce the cost to produce our products in a manner consistent with prior periods. In addition, some suppliers have indicated that, as a result of current shortages, they intend to cease manufacture of certain components used in our products. Limits on manufacturing availability or capacity or delays in production or delivery of components or raw materials due to COVID-related restrictions could further delay or inhibit our ability to obtain supply of components and produce finished goods. There can be no assurance that the impacts of the pandemic on the supply chain will not continue, or worsen, in the future. These supply chain constraints and their related challenges could result in shortages, increased material costs or use of cash, engineering design changes, and delays in new product introductions, each of which could adversely impact our growth, gross margin and financial results. These types of negative financial impacts on our business may become more acute as supply chain pressures increase.Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the escalation of labor and benefit costs. Consistent with the experience of other employers, our labor, medical and workers’ compensation costs have increased substantially in recent years and are expected to continue to rise. If this trend continues, the cost of labor and to provide healthcare and other benefits to our employees could increase, adversely impacting profitability. As the labor market recovers from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, competition for employees has escalated which has increased costs associated with attracting and retaining employees. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently or that our labor costs will not increase as a result of a shortage in the availability of skilled employees. Changes to healthcare regulations involving the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may also increase the cost of providing such benefits to our employees. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing, or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation or related proposals and policies on our results. Any significant increases in the costs attributable to our self-insured health and workers’ compensation plans could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Price inflation for labor and materials, further exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We experienced considerable price inflation in our costs for labor and materials during 2022, which adversely affected our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may not be able to pass through inflationary cost increases under our existing fixed-price contracts. Our ability to raise prices to reflect increased costs may be limited by competitive conditions in the market for our products and services. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and prolonged conflict there, may continue to result in increased inflation, escalating energy and commodity prices and increasing costs of materials. We continue to work to mitigate such pressures on our business operations as they develop. To the extent the war in Ukraine adversely affects our business as discussed above, it may also have the effect of heightening 12many of the other risks described herein, such as those relating to cybersecurity, supply chain, volatility in prices and market conditions, any of which could negatively affect our business and financial condition.If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, our prime contract performance and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted. Many of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor. Failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide, on a timely basis, the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations with our customer and could result in the assessment of late delivery penalties. Subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders.Some of our contracts contain late delivery penalties. Failure to deliver in a timely manner due to supplier and supply chain problems, labor availability, development schedule slides, manufacturing difficulties, or similar schedule-related events could have a material adverse effect on our business. No significant penalties have been incurred to date.Our results of operations are affected by our fixed-price contracts, which could subject us to losses in the event that we have cost overruns. For the year ended December 31, 2022, fixed-price contracts represented almost all of the Company’s sales. On fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the scope of work specified in the contract for a predetermined price. Depending on the fixed price negotiated, these contacts may provide us with an opportunity to achieve higher profits based on the relationship between our costs and the contract’s fixed price. However, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit or cause us to incur a loss on the contract, which would reduce our net earnings. Because our ability to terminate contracts is generally limited, we may not be able to terminate our performance requirements under these contracts at all or without substantial liability and, therefore, in the event we are sustaining reduced profits or losses, we could continue to sustain these reduced profits or losses for the duration of the contract term. The failure of our products may damage our reputation, necessitate a product recall or result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages. Defects in the design and manufacture of our products may necessitate a product recall. We include complex system design and components in our products that could contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products. If any of our products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. Such an event could result in significant expenses, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products. We are also exposed to product liability claims. We carry aircraft and non-aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms. However, this insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover the payment of any potential claim. Additionally, should insurance market conditions change, aircraft and non-aircraft product liability insurance coverage may not be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us. A product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Financial RisksWe have incurred losses in prior fiscal years and our future profitability is not certain. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred a net loss of $35.7 million. Our operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and we cannot be certain that we will be profitable or that we will not experience substantial net losses in the future. If we are not able to increase revenue and reduce our costs, we may not be able to achieve profitability in future periods and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility contain financial and restrictive covenants that we may be unable to satisfy, and that, if not satisfied, could result in the acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness thereunder and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the terms of our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility contain covenants that restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to take certain actions. Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility each subject us to various financial and other affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply on an ongoing or periodic basis. These include financial covenants pertaining to minimum trailing four quarter EBITDA requirements, minimum liquidity requirements, minimum fixed charge coverage ratio requirements, maximum capital expenditure requirements, and excess cash flow repayment provisions. An unexpected decline in our revenues or operating income, including occurring as a result of events beyond our control, could cause us to violate our financial covenants. A covenant violation could result in a default under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility. If any such default occurs, the lenders may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. Further, as the amount available to us under our credit facilities is subject to borrowing base calculations determined by the value of accounts 13receivable and inventory (under our ABL Revolving Credit Facility) and real estate and fixed assets (under our Term Loan Facility), an unexpected decline in the value of these assets would require a mandatory prepayment.  If any of these events were to occur, we may not be able to pay our debts and other monetary obligations as they come due, and our ability to continue to operate as a going concern could be impaired, which could in turn cause a significant decline in our stock price and could result in a significant loss of value for our shareholders. Furthermore, the lenders also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings, which could leave us without access to sufficient liquidity to operate our business. In addition, following an event of default, the lenders under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which includes our available accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, real estate and intellectual property. If the debt under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt. Additionally, our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility also contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on the Company and our subsidiaries and may limit our ability to engage in acts that we believe to be in our long-term best interests. The ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility includes covenants restricting, among other things, the ability of the Company and our subsidiaries to: •incur additional indebtedness;•pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock;•make certain acquisitions or investments;•sell assets; and•engage in certain business activities.The amount of debt we have outstanding, as well as any debt we may incur in the future, could have an adverse effect on our operational and financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $164.0 million of debt outstanding. Changes to our level of debt subsequent to December 31, 2022 could have significant consequences to our business, including the following:•Depending on interest rates and debt maturities, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to paying principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for our acquisition strategy, capital expenditures or other purposes;•A significant amount of additional debt could make us more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions or increases in prevailing interest rates;•Our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, capital expenditures or for other purposes could be impaired;•The increase in the amount of debt we have outstanding and the associated interest expense increases the risk of non-compliance with some of the covenants in our debt agreements which require us to maintain specified financial ratios; and•We may be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may result in a competitive disadvantage.Subject to the limits contained in our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks described above related to our debt could intensify.A write-off of all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our operating results and net worth. At December 31, 2022, goodwill and net intangible assets were approximately 9.5% and 12.9% of our total assets, respectively. In 2020, we recorded goodwill impairment charges associated with four Aerospace reporting units, totaling $86.3 million. We had no such impairment charges during 2022 or 2021. Our goodwill and other intangible assets may increase in the future since our strategy includes growing through acquisitions. We may have to write-off all or part of our goodwill or purchased intangible assets if their value becomes impaired. Although this write-off would not result in an outlay of cash and is not included in the financial covenant calculation, it could reduce our earnings and net worth significantly.We are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks that could adversely affect our business, liquidity and operating results. Changes in the availability, terms and cost of capital, and increases in interest rates could cause our cost of doing business to increase and place us at a competitive disadvantage. At December 31, 2022, all of our debt was subject to variable interest rates.Our future operating results could be impacted by estimates used to calculate impairment losses on long-lived assets. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant and subjective estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of tangible and intangible long-lived assets in the financial statements. These estimates are integral in the determination of whether a potential non-cash impairment loss exists as well as the calculation of that loss. Actual future results could differ from those estimates. As 14discussed in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report, we recorded a long-lived asset impairment charge of approximately $0.7 million in the year ending December 31, 2020. We had no such impairment charges in 2022 or 2021.Changes in discount rates and other estimates could affect our future earnings and equity. Our goodwill asset impairment evaluations are determined using valuations that involve several assumptions, including discount rates, cash flow estimates, growth rates and terminal values. Certain of these assumptions, particularly the discount rate, are based on market conditions and are outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity.Additionally, pension obligations and the related costs are determined using actual results and actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions. The most critical assumption is the discount rate. Other assumptions include mortality, salary levels and retirement age. The discount rate assumptions are based on current market conditions and are outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity. Changes in tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results. Changes in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those with retroactive effect, could result in increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows. For example, beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years for tax purposes. The most significant impact of this provision is to the cash tax liability for 2023 (as the liability for 2022 is partially offset by certain tax credits and loss carryforwards); the impact will decline annually thereafter over the five-year amortization period to an immaterial amount in year six.Legal and Compliance RisksWe currently are involved in, and may become involved in the future in, legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could materially and adversely impact our financial condition. As an aerospace company, we may become a party to litigation, including, among others, matters alleging product liability, warranty claims, intellectual property infringement, breach of commercial or government contract or other legal actions. In general, litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.Currently, our AES subsidiary is a defendant in actions filed in various jurisdictions by Lufthansa Technik AG relating to an allegation of patent infringement and based on rulings to date we have concluded that losses related to these proceedings are probable. If these actions are decided adversely against the Company, the associated damages could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Refer to Note 19 of our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report for discussion on this and other legal proceedings. Other than these proceedings, we are not party to any significant pending legal proceedings that management believes will result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Our operations in foreign countries expose us to political and currency risks and adverse changes in local legal and regulatory environments. In 2022, approximately 9% of our sales were made by our subsidiaries in foreign countries, predominately in our subsidiaries in France and Canada. Net assets held by our foreign subsidiaries total $36.6 million at December 31, 2022. Approximately 22% of our consolidated sales in 2022 were made to customers outside of the United States. Our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies and by the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local currencies into U.S. dollars. We expect international operations and export sales to continue to contribute to our earnings for the foreseeable future. Both the sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside of the U.S. Such risks include the possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations, changes in tariff and trade barriers and import or export licensing requirements, and political or economic reprioritization, insurrection, civil disturbance or war.Government regulations could limit our ability to sell our products outside the U.S. and could otherwise adversely affect our business. Certain of our sales are subject to compliance with U.S. export regulations. Our failure to obtain, or fully adhere to the limitations contained in, the requisite licenses, meet registration standards or comply with other government export regulations would hinder our ability to generate sales of our products outside the U.S. Compliance with these government regulations may also subject us to additional fees and operating costs. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In order to sell our products in European Union countries, we must satisfy certain technical requirements. If we are unable to comply with those requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products, our sales in Europe would be restricted. Doing business internationally also subjects us to numerous 15U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, foreign corrupt practices and anti-boycott provisions. Our failure, or failure by an authorized agent or representative that is attributable to us, to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in monetary penalties, suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which would have a material adverse effect on us.Trade policies, treaties, and tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our business is dependent on the availability of raw materials and components for our products, particularly electrical components common in the semiconductor industry. There is continued uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and various other countries, most significantly China, with respect to trade policies, treaties, tariffs, and taxes. Under the Biden administration, changes in U.S. administrative policy could lead to changes in existing trade agreements, greater restrictions on free trade generally, and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States, particularly tariffs on products manufactures in China and Mexico, among other possible changes. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, could have a material effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and could significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between the impacted nations and the United States.We may face reputational, regulatory or financial risks from a perceived, or an actual, failure to achieve our sustainability goals. The increased focus on sustainability practices and disclosures is rapidly evolving, as is the criteria to measure our sustainability performance; both of which could result in greater expectations and may cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy the evolving criteria. As we advance our sustainable business model, we are pursuing programs that we believe will improve our environmental practices, social engagement and how we govern ourselves. We periodically publish information about our sustainability goals, standards and frameworks. Achievement of these objectives is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our direct control, and it is possible we may fail, or be perceived to have failed, in the achievement of our sustainability goals. Also, certain customers, associates, shareholders, investors, suppliers, business partners, government agencies and non-governmental organizations may not be satisfied with our sustainability efforts. A failure or perceived failure of our sustainability goals could negatively affect our reputation and our results of operations.This uncertainty includes: (i) the possibility of altering the existing tariffs or penalties on products manufactured outside the United States, including the U.S. government’s 25% tariff on a range of products from China; (ii) the effects stemming from the removal of such previously imposed tariffs; (iii) subsequent tariffs imposed by the United States on any other U.S. trading partners such as Russia; and (iv) potential tariffs imposed by trading partners on U.S. goods. The institution of trade tariffs on items imported by us from other countries could increase our costs, which could have a negative impact on our business.We cannot predict whether, and to what extent, there may be changes to international trade agreements or whether quotas, duties, tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions on our products will be changed or imposed. In addition, an open conflict or war across any region could affect our ability to obtain raw materials. For example, the current military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and related sanctions, export controls or other actions that may be initiated by nations, including the United States, the European Union or Russia (e.g., potential cyberattacks, disruption of energy flows, etc.) or potential sanctions or relevant export controls related to China or Taiwan could adversely affect our business and/or our supply chain or our business partners or customers in other countries beyond Russia and Ukraine. Although we currently maintain alternative sources for raw materials, if we are unable to source our products from the countries where we wish to purchase them, either because of the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts, regulatory changes or for any other reason, or if the cost of doing so increases, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Disruptions in the supply of raw materials and components could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers or require us to pay higher prices to obtain these raw materials or components from other sources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations.General RisksOur future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team and technical personnel. The loss of members of our management team could have a material and adverse effect on our business. In addition, competition for qualified technical personnel in our industry is intense, and we believe that our future growth and success will depend on our ability to attract, train and retain such personnel.Future terror attacks, war, or other civil disturbances could negatively impact our business. Continued terror attacks, war or other disturbances could lead to economic instability and decreases in demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Terrorist attacks world-wide have caused instability from time to time in global financial markets and the aviation industry. The long-term effects of terrorist attacks on us are unknown. These attacks and the U.S. government’s continued efforts against terrorist organizations may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the U.S. or elsewhere, which may further contribute to economic instability.16If we fail to meet expectations of securities analysts or investors due to fluctuations in our sales or operating results, our stock price could decline significantly. Our sales and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including delays or cancellations of programs and the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain challenges on revenues and costs. It is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. In this event, the trading price of our stock could decline significantly.Our stock price is volatile. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our stock price ranged from a low of $7.61 to a high of $14.71. The price of our common stock has been and likely will continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of events and factors, such as:•our ability to comply with the financial and other affirmative and negative covenants included in our ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility;•quarterly variations in operating results;•variances of our quarterly results of operations from securities analyst estimates;•changes in financial estimates;•announcements of technological innovations and new products;•news reports relating to trends in our markets;•the cancellation of major contracts or programs with our customers; and•impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the aerospace industry and our Company.In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for companies in the aerospace and defense industry in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies affected by these fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Global health crises, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, with the breadth of its impact worldwide, and particularly on the aerospace industry, could also cause significant volatility in the market price"
0,ATRO,ASTRONICS CORP,2022-03-04,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSCovid-19 Pandemic RisksOur business, financial results, and prospects are dependent on global aerospace demand. The continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had and are expected to continue to have a significant negative impact on aerospace demand, our business and our industry, including any potential impacts of vaccination requirements. Other epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar impact. As previously disclosed, we face risks related to outbreaks of infectious diseases, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has caused significant volatility in financial markets, including the market price of our stock, and the aerospace industry. The continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had and are expected to continue to have a significant negative impact on aviation demand, our business, our supply chain and our industry, including any potential impacts of vaccination requirements.The extent to which the pandemic will continue to negatively affect our business and results of operations will depend on many changing factors and developments including, without limitation, the following:•the severity, extent, and duration of the pandemic including emerging variants of the virus, its impact on the aircraft industry and aviation and related aftermarket demand, and any additional production suspensions or reductions relating to the pandemic;•the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments against emerging variant strains of COVID-19 and over the long-term;•continued travel restrictions and bans, bans on public gatherings, and closures of non-essential businesses;•any potential impacts of vaccination requirements and the ability to retain and recruit the workforce required to meet production requirements;•economic stimulus efforts;•economic recessions resulting from the pandemic;•any inability of significant portions of our workforce to work effectively, including because of illness, remote work, quarantines, social distancing, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic;•potential lawsuits or regulatory actions due to COVID-19 spread in the workplace;•our ability to maintain our compliance practices and procedures, financial reporting processes and related controls, and manage the complex accounting issues presented by the COVID-19 pandemic;•the impact on the Company’s vendors and outsourced business processes and their process and controls documentation;•potential failure or reduced capacity of third parties on which the Company relies, including suppliers, lenders, and other business partners, to meet the Company’s obligations and needs;8•the impact of the pandemic on the financial position of our customers;•the impact of the pandemic on the availability and cost of materials;•the impact on our contracts with our customers and suppliers, including force majeure provisions;•the impact on the financial markets, including volatility in the financial markets;•the availability and cost of credit to the Company; and•the impact of government health and protection policies on future air traffic demand.Several of these effects have already occurred and any or all of these items may occur or recur, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While the Company has taken action to reduce costs, increase liquidity and strengthen its financial position in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance that our actions will mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our business.We expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a significant negative impact on our business for the duration of the pandemic and for an indeterminate time thereafter until demand grows closer to 2019 levels and supply chain challenges abate. Our business improvement depends on OEM production of aircraft at sufficient levels, which depends upon the public’s willingness to use aircraft travel, the success of vaccination programs across the globe, sufficient OEM demand and orders (without suspension) from airlines, and the ability of airlines to weather the crisis and expand. Further, we expect that the pandemic recovery time for wide-body aircraft may be longer than for narrow-body aircraft due to reduced traveler demand and lower volumes of international travel. If the pandemic worsens or there is significant uncertainty on the commercial aerospace industry’s recovery, we may find it difficult to obtain additional financing and/or fund our operations and meet our debt repayment obligations. Recognizing the unprecedented nature, scale and uncertainty associated with this global health crisis, the duration and extent of the on-going impacts cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.Market RisksThe loss of Boeing or Panasonic as major customers or a significant reduction in business with either of those customers would reduce our sales and earnings. In 2021, we had a concentration of sales to Boeing representing approximately 10.0% of our sales. In 2020 and 2019, we also had a concentration of sales to Panasonic in excess of 10% of sales in those years. The loss of these customers or a significant reduction in business with them would significantly reduce our sales and earnings.In October 2018 and March of 2019, two commercial aircraft accidents led to the grounding by the Federal Aviation Administration and other regulators of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, on which we have significant content, and which represented our largest OEM production program before the pandemic. The grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX, which started in March of 2019, caused the production rate of that aircraft to be lower than expected in fiscal year 2019 and 2020. The 737 MAX grounding affected our business both because of the production pause, impacting our line-fit content, and because it left many of our airline customers short of capacity, particularly in 2019 but continuing into 2020, which made them reluctant to take other aircraft out of service to install the types of retrofit products they buy from us. Although the 737 MAX was re-certified in the United States in November 2020 and in Europe in January 2021, if production rates do not materialize as anticipated, our Aerospace segment sales could be significantly impacted in the near or long-term, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Even as deliveries of the 737 MAX program resume, demand for the aircraft could be lower than was expected prior to the initial grounding of the aircraft due to the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.The markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and events, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate. Demand for our products is, to a large extent, dependent on the demand and success of our customers' products where we are a supplier to an OEM. In our Aerospace segment, demand by the business jet markets for our products is dependent upon several factors, including capital investment, product innovations, economic growth and wealth creation and technology upgrades. In addition, the commercial airline industry is highly cyclical and sensitive to such things as fuel price increases, labor disputes, global economic conditions, availability of capital to fund new aircraft purchases and upgrades of existing aircraft and passenger demand, all of which have been significantly impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A change in any of these factors could result in a further reduction in the amount of air travel and the ability of airlines to invest in new aircraft or to upgrade existing aircraft. These factors would reduce orders for new aircraft and would likely reduce airlines’ spending for cabin upgrades for which we supply products, thus reducing our sales and profits. A reduction in air travel may also result in our commercial airline customers being unable to pay our invoices on a timely basis or not at all.We are a supplier on various new aircraft programs just entering or expected to begin production in the future. As with any new program, there is risk as to whether the aircraft or program will be successful and accepted by the market. As is customary for our business, we purchase inventory and invest in specific capital equipment to support our production requirements generally based on delivery schedules provided by our customer. If a program or aircraft is not successful, we may have to write-off all or 9a part of the inventory, accounts receivable and capital equipment related to the program. A write-off of these assets could result in a significant reduction of earnings and cause covenant violations relating to our debt agreements. This could result in our being unable to borrow additional funds under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness.In our Test Systems segment, the market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment. In any one reporting period, a single customer or several customers may contribute an even larger percentage of our consolidated sales. In addition, our ability to increase sales will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers. The opportunities to obtain orders from these customers may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow sales. We expect that sales of our Test Systems products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future. Additionally, demand for some of our test products is dependent upon government funding levels for our products, our ability to compete successfully for those contracts and our ability to develop products to satisfy the demands of our customers.Our products are sold in highly competitive markets. Some of our competitors are larger, more diversified corporations and have greater financial, marketing, production and research and development resources. As a result, they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns. Our operations and financial performance will be negatively impacted if our competitors:•develop products that are superior to our products;•develop products that are more competitively priced than our products;•develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services; or•adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.We believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality, price, design and engineering capabilities, product development, conformity to customer specifications, quality of support after the sale, timeliness of delivery and effectiveness of the distribution organization. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. If we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments, or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position, our operations and financial performance will suffer.We depend on government contracts and subcontracts with defense prime contractors and subcontractors that may not be fully funded, may be terminated, or may be awarded to our competitors. The failure to be awarded these contracts, the failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales. Sales to the U.S. government and its prime contractors and subcontractors represent a significant portion of our business. The funding of these programs is generally subject to annual congressional appropriations, and congressional priorities are subject to change. In addition, government expenditures for defense programs may decline or these defense programs may be terminated. A decline in governmental expenditures or the termination of existing contracts may result in a reduction in the volume of contracts awarded to us. We have resources applied to specific government contracts and if any of those contracts were terminated, we may incur substantial costs redeploying those resources.Contracting in the defense industry is subject to significant regulation, including rules related to bidding, billing and accounting kickbacks and false claims, and any non-compliance could subject us to fines and penalties or possible debarment. Like all government contractors, we are subject to risks associated with this contracting. These risks include the potential for substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in suspension or debarment from future government contracts.Strategic RisksWe may incur losses and liabilities as a result of our acquisition strategy. Growth by acquisition involves risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results, including:•the potential exposure to unanticipated liabilities;•the potential that expected benefits or synergies are not realized and that operating costs increase;•the risks associated with incurring additional acquisition indebtedness, including that additional indebtedness could limit our cash flow availability for operations and our flexibility;•difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies;•the potential loss of key employees, suppliers or customers of acquired businesses; and10•diversion of management time and attention from our core business.In addition, any acquisition, once successfully integrated, could negatively impact our financial performance if it does not perform as planned, does not increase earnings, or does not prove otherwise to be beneficial to us.If we are unable to adapt to technological change, demand for our products may be reduced. The technologies related to our products have undergone, and in the future may undergo, significant changes. To succeed in the future, we will need to continue to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. Our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we develop or that render our technology and products obsolete or uncompetitive. Furthermore, our products could become unmarketable if new industry standards emerge. We may have to modify our products significantly in the future to remain competitive, and new products we introduce may not be accepted by our customers.Our new product development efforts may not be successful, which would result in a reduction in our sales and earnings. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development of new products or product enhancements, and new products or product enhancements may not be accepted by our customers. In addition, the development expenses we incur may exceed our cost estimates, and new products we develop may not generate sales sufficient to offset our costs. If any of these events occur, our sales and profits could be adversely affected.Operational RisksOur business and operations could be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology infrastructure or adversely impacted by a successful cyber-attack. We are dependent on various information technologies throughout our Company to administer, store and support multiple business activities. We routinely experience various cybersecurity threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure, unauthorized attempts to gain access to our Company sensitive information, and denial-of-service attacks as do our customers, suppliers and subcontractors. We conduct regular periodic training of our employees as to the protection of sensitive information which includes security awareness training intended to prevent the success of “phishing” attacks. The threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, including nation states, which target us and other defense contractors because we protect sensitive information. If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures, and depending on the severity of the incident, our customers’ data, our employees’ data, our intellectual property, and other third-party data (such as subcontractors, suppliers and vendors) could be compromised. As a consequence of their persistence, sophistication and volume, we may not be successful in defending against all such attacks. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.Although we work cooperatively with our customers, suppliers, and subcontractors to seek to minimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by these entities, which may affect the security of our information. These entities have varying levels of cybersecurity expertise and safeguards and their relationships with U.S. government contractors, such as Astronics, may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber threats we face. Our inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property or defend against assertions of infringement could prevent or restrict our ability to compete. We rely on patents, trademarks and proprietary knowledge and technology, both internally developed and acquired, in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Our inability to defend against the unauthorized use of these rights and assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against claims of infringement. This litigation could result in significant costs and divert our management’s focus away from operations. Refer to the risk factor related to pending patent infringement litigation below and Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.If critical components or raw materials used to manufacture our products or used in our development programs become scarce or unavailable, then we may incur delays in manufacturing and delivery of our products and in completing our development programs, which has damaged, and could continue to damage, our business, results of operations and financial condition. Due to increased demand across a range of industries, the global supply chain for certain critical components or raw materials used in the manufacture of our products and used in our development programs has experienced significant strain in recent periods. Particularly, the market for electronic components is experiencing increased demand, creating substantial uncertainty regarding our suppliers’ continued production of key components for our products. The COVID-19 pandemic has also contributed to and exacerbated this strain. This constrained supply environment has adversely 11affected, and could further affect, availability, lead times and cost of components, and could impact our ability to complete development programs, respond to accelerated or quick-turn delivery requests from customers, or meet customer demand and product delivery dates for our end customers where we cannot timely secure adequate supply of these components. Moreover, if any of our suppliers become financially unstable, or otherwise unable or unwilling to provide us with raw materials or components, then we may have to find new suppliers. It may take several months to locate alternative suppliers, if required, or to redesign our products to accommodate components from different suppliers. We may experience significant delays in manufacturing and shipping our products to customers and incur additional development, manufacturing and other costs to establish alternative sources of supply if we lose any of these sources or are required to redesign our products. We cannot predict if we will be able to obtain replacement components within the time frames that we require at an acceptable cost, if at all. In an effort to mitigate these risks, in some cases, we have incurred higher costs to secure available inventory, or have extended or placed non-cancellable purchase commitments with suppliers, which introduces inventory risk if our forecasts and assumptions prove inaccurate. While we may attempt to recover the increased costs through price increases to our customers, we may be unable to mitigate the effect on our results of operations. We have also multi-sourced and pre-ordered components and raw materials inventory in some cases in an effort to reduce the impact of the adverse supply chain conditions we have experienced. Despite our attempts to mitigate the impact on our business, these constrained supply conditions are expected to adversely impact our costs of goods sold, including our ability to continue to reduce the cost to produce our products in a manner consistent with prior periods. In addition, some suppliers have indicated that, as a result of current shortages, they intend to cease manufacture of certain components used in our products. Limits on manufacturing availability or capacity or delays in production or delivery of components or raw materials due to COVID-related restrictions could further delay or inhibit our ability to obtain supply of components and produce finished goods. There can be no assurance that the impacts of the pandemic on the supply chain will not continue, or worsen, in the future. These supply chain constraints and their related challenges could result in shortages, increased material costs or use of cash, engineering design changes, and delays in new product introductions, each of which could adversely impact our growth, gross margin and financial results. These types of negative financial impacts on our business may become more acute as supply chain pressures increase.Our financial results could be adversely impacted by the escalation of labor and benefit costs. Consistent with the experience of other employers, our labor, medical and workers’ compensation costs have increased substantially in recent years and are expected to continue to rise. If this trend continues, the cost of labor and to provide healthcare and other benefits to our employees could increase, adversely impacting profitability. As the labor market recovers from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, competition for employees has escalated which has increased costs associated with attracting and retaining employees. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently or that our labor costs will not increase as a result of a shortage in the availability of skilled employees. Changes to healthcare regulations involving the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may also increase the cost of providing such benefits to our employees. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing, or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation or related proposals and policies on our results. Any significant increases in the costs attributable to our self-insured health and workers’ compensation plans could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Government vaccine mandates could result in workforce attrition for us and our suppliers which could adversely affect our operations and supply chain. On September 9, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order requiring all employers with U.S. Government contracts to ensure that their U.S.-based employees, contractors, and subcontractors, that work in affected facilities or work on or in support of U.S. Government contracts are fully vaccinated. The deadline for vaccination was initially December 8, 2021, but the White House announced on November 4, 2021 that the deadline would be extended to January 4, 2022. The executive order includes on-site and remote U.S.-based employees, contractors and subcontractors and permits only limited exceptions for medical and religious reasons. Substantially all of our subsidiaries are either directly subject to the executive order, or will be required to comply with the executive order via flowdown from our affected customers. It is currently not possible to predict with certainty the impact the executive order will have on our workforce, or on our suppliers who may also be impacted. As a U.S. Government contractor, and as a supplier to customers who are U.S. Government contractors, we took steps to comply with the executive order mandating COVID-19 vaccines across our U.S.-based workforce, contractors and subcontractors that service or support our U.S. Government contracts, and who do not qualify for medical or religious exemptions, to be fully vaccinated by January 4, 2022, until it was enjoined by a federal court in December 2021. The vaccine mandate currently remains enjoined and the Government has announced that it will take no efforts to enforce it, absent further notice from the contracting agency, where the place of performance is a U.S. state or an excluded outlying area. If the vaccine mandate is revived, the Company will resume efforts to work with employees who have not yet either submitted proof of vaccination or requested an accommodation. Additional vaccine mandates may be announced in jurisdictions in which our businesses operate. Implementation of these requirements may result in attrition, including attrition of critically skilled labor, and difficulty securing future labor needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and 12results of operations. Further, implementation of these requirements by our suppliers may result in workforce attrition at our suppliers, which may result in disruption to our supply chain which, in turn, may have a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations by impacting ability to acquire certain raw materials and components used in the manufacture of our products and in our development programs.If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, our prime contract performance and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted. Many of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor. Failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide, on a timely basis, the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations with our customer and could result in the assessment of late delivery penalties. Subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders.Some of our contracts contain late delivery penalties. Failure to deliver in a timely manner due to supplier problems, development schedule slides, manufacturing difficulties, or similar schedule-related events could have a material adverse effect on our business. No significant penalties have been incurred to date.Our results of operations are affected by our fixed-price contracts, which could subject us to losses in the event that we have cost overruns. For the year ended December 31, 2021, fixed-price contracts represented almost all of the Company’s sales. On fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the scope of work specified in the contract for a predetermined price. Depending on the fixed price negotiated, these contacts may provide us with an opportunity to achieve higher profits based on the relationship between our costs and the contract’s fixed price. However, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit.The failure of our products may damage our reputation, necessitate a product recall or result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages. Defects in the design and manufacture of our products may necessitate a product recall. We include complex system design and components in our products that could contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products. If any of our products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. Such an event could result in significant expenses, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products. We are also exposed to product liability claims. We carry aircraft and non-aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms. However, this insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover the payment of any potential claim. A product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Financial RisksWe are subject to debt covenant restrictions. The terms of our credit facility may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to take certain actions. Our credit facility contains certain financial covenants. An unexpected decline in our operating income could cause us to violate our covenants. A covenant violation could result in a default under the revolving credit facility. If any such default occurs, the lenders may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. In addition, following an event of default, the lenders under the credit facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which includes our available cash. If the debt under the credit facility were to be accelerated, we cannot assure that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt.Additionally, our credit facility also contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on the Company and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests. The credit facility includes covenants restricting, among other things, the ability of the Company to: •incur additional indebtedness;•pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock;•make certain acquisitions or investments;•sell assets; and•engage in certain business activities.13The amount of debt we have outstanding, as well as any debt we may incur in the future, could have an adverse effect on our operational and financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $163.0 million of long-term debt outstanding. Changes to our level of debt subsequent to December 31, 2021 could have significant consequences to our business, including the following:•Depending on interest rates and debt maturities, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to paying principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for our acquisition strategy, capital expenditures or other purposes;•A significant amount of additional debt could make us more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions or increases in prevailing interest rates;•Our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, capital expenditures or for other purposes could be impaired;•The increase in the amount of debt we have outstanding and the associated interest expense increases the risk of non-compliance with some of the covenants in our debt agreements which require us to maintain specified financial ratios; and•We may be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may result in a competitive disadvantage.Our inability to refinance our existing long-term debt maturing in 2023 on terms that are favorable to us may materially and adversely impact our operations and future growth and expansion initiatives. Our credit facility, of which $163.0 million is outstanding as of December 31, 2021, is currently scheduled to mature in 2023. While we expect to be able to refinance, replace or extend the maturity date of our credit facility before it matures, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain such debt refinancing on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The extent to which we will be able to effect such refinancing, replacement or maturity extension on terms that are favorable to us or at all is dependent on a number of highly uncertain factors, including then-prevailing credit and other market conditions, economic conditions, particularly in the aerospace and defense markets, disruptions or volatility caused by factors such as COVID-19, regional conflicts, inflation, and supply chain disruptions. In addition, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance our existing credit facility when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing. As the Company’s long-term debt approaches maturity, if the Company is unable to refinance, replace or extend the maturity on its credit facility, the Company’s liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted.Furthermore, certain covenants and other terms of our existing credit facility impose significant restrictions on our operational flexibility. In connection with debt refinancing, our ability to negotiate more favorable and flexible covenants and terms, including financial covenants, is highly uncertain. An inability to complete our debt refinancing on terms that are more favorable to us than the covenants and terms in effect under our existing credit facility could materially and adversely impact our business, operations and future growth and expansion initiatives. In particular, if the covenants and terms under our refinanced indebtedness were to remain unchanged as compared to those under our current credit facility, we may be required to take certain operational measures or decline to pursue certain growth initiatives in order to maintain compliance with these restrictive covenants and terms, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.A write-off of all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our operating results and net worth. At December 31, 2021, goodwill and net intangible assets were approximately 9.6% and 15.5% of our total assets, respectively. In 2020, we recorded goodwill impairment charges associated with four Aerospace reporting units, totaling $86.3 million. In 2019, we recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $1.6 million and $6.2 million related to our AeroSat antenna business, respectively. We had no such impairment charges during 2021. Our goodwill and other intangible assets may increase in the future since our strategy includes growing through acquisitions. We may have to write-off all or part of our goodwill or purchased intangible assets if their value becomes impaired. Although this write-off would not result in an outlay of cash, it could reduce our earnings and net worth significantly.We are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks that could adversely affect our business, liquidity and operating results. Changes in the availability, terms and cost of capital, and increases in interest rates could cause our cost of doing business to increase and place us at a competitive disadvantage. At December 31, 2021, all of our debt was subject to variable interest rates.The potential phase out of LIBOR may negatively impact our debt agreements and financial position, results of operations and liquidity. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 and it is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established. If LIBOR ceases to exist after 2021, a comparable or successor reference rate as approved by the Administrative Agent under the Credit Agreement will apply or such other reference rate as may be agreed by the Company and the lenders under the Credit Agreement. Prior to its amendment on March 1, 2022, the interest rate under our Amended Credit Facility was calculated using LIBOR. In conjunction with the amendment, our Amended Credit Facility is now based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), rather than LIBOR. However, that agreement 14expires in May 2023 and it is unclear at this time whether different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness will develop. We cannot predict the impact that an alternative benchmark rate may have on the terms of our future indebtedness or interest cost. However, an increase in our cost of borrowing could result in an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.Our future operating results could be impacted by estimates used to calculate impairment losses on long-lived assets. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant and subjective estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of tangible and intangible long-lived assets in the financial statements. These estimates are integral in the determination of whether a potential non-cash impairment loss exists as well as the calculation of that loss. Actual future results could differ from those estimates. As discussed in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report, we recorded a long-lived asset impairment charge of approximately $0.7 million and $9.5 million in the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We had no such impairment charges in 2021.Changes in discount rates and other estimates could affect our future earnings and equity. Our goodwill asset impairment evaluations are determined using valuations that involve several assumptions, including discount rates, cash flow estimates, growth rates and terminal values. Certain of these assumptions, particularly the discount rate, are based on market conditions and are outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity.Additionally, pension obligations and the related costs are determined using actual results and actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions. The most critical assumption is the discount rate. Other assumptions include mortality, salary levels and retirement age. The discount rate assumptions are based on current market conditions and are outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity. Legal and Compliance RisksWe currently are involved or may become involved in the future, in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could materially impact our financial condition. As an aerospace company, we may become a party to litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including, among others, matters alleging product liability, warranty claims, breach of commercial or government contract or other legal actions. In general, litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact results of operations and financial condition.Currently, our subsidiary, AES is a defendant in actions filed in various jurisdictions by Lufthansa Technik AG relating to an allegation of patent infringement and based on rulings to date we have concluded that losses related to these proceedings are probable. If these actions are decided adversely against the Company, the associated damages could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Refer to Note 19 of our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for discussion on this and other legal proceedings. Other than these proceedings, we are not party to any significant pending legal proceedings that management believes will result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Our operations in foreign countries expose us to political and currency risks and adverse changes in local legal and regulatory environments. In 2021, approximately 8% of our sales were made by our subsidiaries in foreign countries, predominately in our subsidiaries in France and Canada. Net assets held by our foreign subsidiaries total $40.5 million at December 31, 2021. Approximately 21% of our consolidated sales in 2021 were made to customers outside of the United States. Our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies and by the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local currencies into U.S. dollars. We expect international operations and export sales to continue to contribute to our earnings for the foreseeable future. Both the sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside of the U.S. Such risks include the possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations, changes in tariff and trade barriers and import or export licensing requirements, and political or economic reprioritization, insurrection, civil disturbance or war.Government regulations could limit our ability to sell our products outside the U.S. and could otherwise adversely affect our business. Certain of our sales are subject to compliance with U.S. export regulations. Our failure to obtain, or fully adhere to the limitations contained in, the requisite licenses, meet registration standards or comply with other government export regulations would hinder our ability to generate sales of our products outside the U.S. Compliance with these government regulations may also subject us to additional fees and operating costs. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In order to sell our products in European Union countries, we must satisfy certain technical requirements. If we are unable to comply with those requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products, our sales in Europe would be restricted. Doing business internationally also subjects us to numerous 15U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, foreign corrupt practices and anti-boycott provisions. Our failure, or failure by an authorized agent or representative that is attributable to us, to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in monetary penalties, suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which would have a material adverse effect on us.General RisksOur future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team and technical personnel. The loss of members of our management team could have a material and adverse effect on our business. In addition, competition for qualified technical personnel in our industry is intense, and we believe that our future growth and success will depend on our ability to attract, train and retain such personnel.Future terror attacks, war, or other civil disturbances could negatively impact our business. Continued terror attacks, war or other disturbances could lead to economic instability and decreases in demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Terrorist attacks world-wide have caused instability from time to time in global financial markets and the aviation industry. The long-term effects of terrorist attacks on us are unknown. These attacks and the U.S. government’s continued efforts against terrorist organizations may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the U.S. or elsewhere, which may further contribute to economic instability.If we fail to meet expectations of securities analysts or investors due to fluctuations in our sales or operating results, our stock price could decline significantly. Our sales and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including delays or cancellations of programs and the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on revenues and costs. It is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. In this event, the trading price of our stock could decline significantly.Our stock price is volatile. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our stock price ranged from a low of $10.04 to a high of $20.51. The price of our common stock has been and likely will continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of events and factors, such as:•quarterly variations in operating results;•variances of our quarterly results of operations from securities analyst estimates;•changes in financial estimates;•announcements of technological innovations and new products;•news reports relating to trends in our markets;•the cancellation of major contracts or programs with our customers; and•impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the aerospace industry and our Company.In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for companies in the aerospace and defense industry in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies affected by these fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Global health crises, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, with the breadth of its impact worldwide, and particularly on the aerospace industry, could also cause significant volatility in the market price"
3,ATRO,ASTRONICS CORP,2021-03-01,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSCovid-19 Pandemic RisksThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and is expected to continue to pose risks to our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and other epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar impact. As previously disclosed, we face risks related to outbreaks of infectious diseases, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has caused significant volatility in financial markets, including the market price of our stock, and the aerospace industry, which has raised the prospect of an extended global recession. In response to COVID-19, national and local governments around the world have instituted certain measures, including travel bans, prohibitions or limits on group events and gatherings, shutdowns of certain businesses, curfews, shelter-in-place orders and recommendations to practice social distancing. Our operations have been deemed essential under applicable law, but there is no guarantee this will continue. We follow the COVID-19 guidelines from the CDC concerning the health and safety of our personnel, these measures have resulted in attenuating activity and, in some cases, required temporary closures of certain of our facilities, among other impacts. The duration of these measures is unknown, may be extended and additional measures, including facility closures, may be imposed.Among the potential effects of COVID-19 and other similar outbreaks on the Company include, but are not limited to, the following:•Reduced consumer and investor confidence, instability in the credit and financial markets, volatile corporate profits, and reduced business and consumer spending, which may adversely affect our results of operations by reducing our sales, margins and/or net income as a result of a slowdown in customer orders or order cancellations. In addition, volatility in the financial markets could increase the cost of capital and/or limit its availability.•Economic uncertainty as a result of COVID-19 is expected to cause continued difficulty for our customers, suppliers and the Company to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.•Aircraft manufacturers have experienced a disruption in production and demand as customers defer delivery of new aircraft, resulting in slowed or halted production at facilities throughout the world. Commercial airlines have experienced a significant reduction in air traffic. Commercial airlines and other manufacturers have focused on conserving cash to preserve liquidity, which has had a negative impact on airframe and aftermarket sales.•The potential to weaken the financial position of some of our customers. If circumstances surrounding our customers’ financial capabilities were to deteriorate, asset write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results and, if large, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.8•Disruption of our supply chain. Our third-party manufacturers, suppliers, third-party distributors, sub-contractors and customers have been and may be disrupted by worker absenteeism, quarantines and restrictions on their employees’ ability to work, office and factory closures, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure, border closures, or other travel or health-related restrictions. Depending on the magnitude of such effects on our manufacturing or the operations of our suppliers, third-party distributors, or sub-contractors, our supply chain, manufacturing and product shipments could be delayed, which could adversely affect our business, operations, and customer relationships. •The need to incur additional restructuring charges to optimize our cost structure if a recovery in the aerospace market occurs slower than anticipated.Recognizing the unprecedented nature, scale and uncertainty associated with this global health crisis, the duration and extent of the on-going impacts cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.Market RisksThe loss of Boeing or Panasonic as major customers or a significant reduction in business with either of those customers would reduce our sales and earnings. In 2020, we had a concentration of sales to Boeing and Panasonic representing approximately 9.5% and 11.1% of our sales, respectively. The loss of either of these customers or a significant reduction in business with them would significantly reduce our sales and earnings.In October 2018 and March of 2019, two commercial aircraft accidents led to the grounding by the Federal Aviation Administration and other regulators of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, on which we have significant content, and which represented our largest OEM production program before the pandemic. The grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX, which started in March of 2019, has caused the production rate of that aircraft to be lower than expected in fiscal year 2019 and 2020. The 737 MAX grounding affected our business both because of the production pause, impacting our line-fit content, and because it left many of our airline customers short of capacity, particularly in 2019 but continuing into 2020, which made them reluctant to take other aircraft out of service to install the types of retrofit products they buy from us. Although the 737 MAX was re-certified in the United States in November 2020 and in Europe in January 2021, if production rates do not materialize as anticipated, our Aerospace segment sales could be significantly impacted in the near or long-term, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Even as deliveries of the 737 MAX program resumes, demand for the aircraft could be lower than was expected prior to the initial grounding of the aircraft due to the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.The markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and events, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate. Demand for our products is, to a large extent, dependent on the demand and success of our customers' products where we are a supplier to an OEM. In our Aerospace segment, demand by the business jet markets for our products is dependent upon several factors, including capital investment, product innovations, economic growth and wealth creation and technology upgrades. In addition, the commercial airline industry is highly cyclical and sensitive to such things as fuel price increases, labor disputes, global economic conditions, availability of capital to fund new aircraft purchases and upgrades of existing aircraft and passenger demand, all of which have been significantly impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A change in any of these factors could result in a further reduction in the amount of air travel and the ability of airlines to invest in new aircraft or to upgrade existing aircraft. These factors would reduce orders for new aircraft and would likely reduce airlines’ spending for cabin upgrades for which we supply products, thus reducing our sales and profits. A reduction in air travel may also result in our commercial airline customers being unable to pay our invoices on a timely basis or not at all.We are a supplier on various new aircraft programs just entering or expected to begin production in the future. As with any new program, there is risk as to whether the aircraft or program will be successful and accepted by the market. As is customary for our business, we purchase inventory and invest in specific capital equipment to support our production requirements generally based on delivery schedules provided by our customer. If a program or aircraft is not successful, we may have to write-off all or a part of the inventory, accounts receivable and capital equipment related to the program. A write-off of these assets could result in a significant reduction of earnings and cause covenant violations relating to our debt agreements. This could result in our being unable to borrow additional funds under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness.In our Test Systems segment, the market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment. In any one reporting period, a single customer or several customers may contribute an even larger percentage of our consolidated sales. In addition, our ability to increase sales will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers. The opportunities to obtain orders from these customers may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow sales. We expect that sales of our Test Systems products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future. 9Additionally, demand for some of our test products is dependent upon government funding levels for our products, our ability to compete successfully for those contracts and our ability to develop products to satisfy the demands of our customers.Our products are sold in highly competitive markets. Some of our competitors are larger, more diversified corporations and have greater financial, marketing, production and research and development resources. As a result, they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns. Our operations and financial performance will be negatively impacted if our competitors:•develop products that are superior to our products;•develop products that are more competitively priced than our products;•develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services; or•adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.We believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality, price, design and engineering capabilities, product development, conformity to customer specifications, quality of support after the sale, timeliness of delivery and effectiveness of the distribution organization. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. If we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments, or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position, our operations and financial performance will suffer.We depend on government contracts and subcontracts with defense prime contractors and subcontractors that may not be fully funded, may be terminated, or may be awarded to our competitors. The failure to be awarded these contracts, the failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales. Sales to the U.S. government and its prime contractors and subcontractors represent a significant portion of our business. The funding of these programs is generally subject to annual congressional appropriations, and congressional priorities are subject to change. In addition, government expenditures for defense programs may decline or these defense programs may be terminated. A decline in governmental expenditures or the termination of existing contracts may result in a reduction in the volume of contracts awarded to us. We have resources applied to specific government contracts and if any of those contracts were terminated, we may incur substantial costs redeploying those resources.Contracting in the defense industry is subject to significant regulation, including rules related to bidding, billing and accounting kickbacks and false claims, and any non-compliance could subject us to fines and penalties or possible debarment. Like all government contractors, we are subject to risks associated with this contracting. These risks include the potential for substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in suspension or debarment from future government contracts.Strategic RisksWe may incur losses and liabilities as a result of our acquisition strategy. Growth by acquisition involves risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results, including:•diversion of management time and attention from our core business;•the potential exposure to unanticipated liabilities;•the potential that expected benefits or synergies are not realized and that operating costs increase;•the risks associated with incurring additional acquisition indebtedness, including that additional indebtedness could limit our cash flow availability for operations and our flexibility;•difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies; and•the potential loss of key employees, suppliers or customers of acquired businesses.In addition, any acquisition, once successfully integrated, could negatively impact our financial performance if it does not perform as planned, does not increase earnings, or does not prove otherwise to be beneficial to us.If we are unable to adapt to technological change, demand for our products may be reduced. The technologies related to our products have undergone, and in the future may undergo, significant changes. To succeed in the future, we will need to continue to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. Our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we develop or that render our technology and products obsolete or uncompetitive. Furthermore, our products could become unmarketable if 10new industry standards emerge. We may have to modify our products significantly in the future to remain competitive, and new products we introduce may not be accepted by our customers.Our new product development efforts may not be successful, which would result in a reduction in our sales and earnings. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development of new products or product enhancements, and new products or product enhancements may not be accepted by our customers. In addition, the development expenses we incur may exceed our cost estimates, and new products we develop may not generate sales sufficient to offset our costs. If any of these events occur, our sales and profits could be adversely affected.Operational RisksOur business and operations could be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology infrastructure or adversely impacted by a successful cyber-attack. We are dependent on various information technologies throughout our Company to administer, store and support multiple business activities. We routinely experience various cybersecurity threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure, unauthorized attempts to gain access to our Company sensitive information, and denial-of-service attacks as do our customers, suppliers and subcontractors. We conduct regular periodic training of our employees as to the protection of sensitive information which includes security awareness training intended to prevent the success of “phishing” attacks. The threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, including nation states, which target us and other defense contractors because we protect sensitive information. If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures, and depending on the severity of the incident, our customers’ data, our employees’ data, our intellectual property, and other third-party data (such as subcontractors, suppliers and vendors) could be compromised. As a consequence of their persistence, sophistication and volume, we may not be successful in defending against all such attacks. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.Although we work cooperatively with our customers, suppliers, and subcontractors to seek to minimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by these entities, which may affect the security of our information. These entities have varying levels of cybersecurity expertise and safeguards and their relationships with U.S. government contractors, such as Astronics, may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber threats we face. Our inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property or defend against assertions of infringement could prevent or restrict our ability to compete. We rely on patents, trademarks and proprietary knowledge and technology, both internally developed and acquired, in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Our inability to defend against the unauthorized use of these rights and assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against claims of infringement. This litigation could result in significant costs and divert our management’s focus away from operations. Refer to the risk factor related to pending patent infringement litigation above and Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion.If our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our prime contract performance and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted. Many of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor. Failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide, on a timely basis, the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations with our customer and could result in the assessment of late delivery penalties. Subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, a delay in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may affect our ability to meet our customers’ needs and may have an adverse effect upon our profitability.Some of our contracts contain late delivery penalties. Failure to deliver in a timely manner due to supplier problems, development schedule slides, manufacturing difficulties, or similar schedule-related events could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our results of operations are affected by our fixed-price contracts, which could subject us to losses in the event that we have cost overruns. For the year ended December 31, 2020, fixed-price contracts represented almost all of the Company’s 11sales. On fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the scope of work specified in the contract for a predetermined price. Depending on the fixed price negotiated, these contacts may provide us with an opportunity to achieve higher profits based on the relationship between our costs and the contract’s fixed price. However, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit.The failure of our products may damage our reputation, necessitate a product recall or result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages. Defects in the design and manufacture of our products may necessitate a product recall. We include complex system design and components in our products that could contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products. If any of our products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. Such an event could result in significant expenses, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products. We are also exposed to product liability claims. We carry aircraft and non-aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms. However, this insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover the payment of any potential claim. A product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Financial RisksWe are subject to debt covenant restrictions. The terms of our credit facility may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to take certain actions. Our credit facility contains certain financial covenants. An unexpected decline in our operating income could cause us to violate our covenants. A covenant violation could result in a default under the revolving credit facility. If any such default occurs, the lenders may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. In addition, following an event of default, the lenders under the credit facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which includes our available cash. If the debt under the credit facility were to be accelerated, we cannot assure that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt.Additionally, our credit facility also contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on the Company and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests. The credit facility includes covenants restricting, among other things, the ability of the Company to •incur additional indebtedness;•pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock;•make certain acquisitions or investments;•sell assets; and•engage in certain business activities.The amount of debt we have outstanding, as well as any debt we may incur in the future, could have an adverse effect on our operational and financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $173.0 million of long-term debt outstanding. Changes to our level of debt subsequent to December 31, 2020 could have significant consequences to our business, including the following:•Depending on interest rates and debt maturities, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to paying principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for our acquisition strategy, capital expenditures or other purposes;•A significant amount of additional debt could make us more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions or increases in prevailing interest rates;•Our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, capital expenditures or for other purposes could be impaired;•The increase in the amount of debt we have outstanding and the associated interest expense increases the risk of non-compliance with some of the covenants in our debt agreements which require us to maintain specified financial ratios; and•We may be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may result in a competitive disadvantage.12A write-off of all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our operating results and net worth. At December 31, 2020, goodwill and net intangible assets were approximately 9.4% and 17.7% of our total assets, respectively. In 2020, we recorded goodwill impairment charges associated with four Aerospace reporting units, totaling $86.3 million. In 2019, we recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $1.6 million and $6.2 million related to our AeroSat antenna business, respectively. Our goodwill and other intangible assets may increase in the future since our strategy includes growing through acquisitions. We may have to write-off all or part of our goodwill or purchased intangible assets if their value becomes impaired. Although this write-off would not result in an outlay of cash, it could reduce our earnings and net worth significantly.We are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks that could adversely affect our business, liquidity and operating results. Changes in the availability, terms and cost of capital, and increases in interest rates could cause our cost of doing business to increase and place us at a competitive disadvantage. At December 31, 2020, all of our debt was subject to variable interest rates.The potential phase out of LIBOR may negatively impact our debt agreements and financial position, results of operations and liquidity. On July 27, 2017, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The administrator of LIBOR has announced it will consult on its intention to cease the publication of the one week and two month USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and the remaining USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. Extending the publication of certain USD LIBOR tenors until June 30, 2023 would allow most legacy USD LIBOR contracts to mature before LIBOR experiences disruptions. However, it is unclear whether different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness will develop. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our debt agreements that extend beyond 2021 that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate, which may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness. In addition, the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial markets could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.Our future operating results could be impacted by estimates used to calculate impairment losses on long-lived assets. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant and subjective estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of long-lived assets in the financial statements. These estimates are integral in the determination of whether a potential non-cash impairment loss exists as well as the calculation of that loss. Actual future results could differ from those estimates. As discussed in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, we recorded a long-lived asset impairment charge of approximately $0.7 million and $9.5 million in the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Changes in discount rates and other estimates could affect our future earnings and equity. Our goodwill asset impairment evaluations are determined using valuations that involve several assumptions, including discount rates, cash flow estimates, growth rates and terminal values. Certain of these assumptions, particularly the discount rate, are based on market conditions and are outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity.Additionally, pension obligations and the related costs are determined using actual results and actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions. The most critical assumption is the discount rate. Other assumptions include mortality, salary increases and retirement age. The discount rate assumptions are based on current market conditions and are outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity. Legal and Compliance RisksWe currently are involved or may become involved in the future, in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could materially impact our financial condition. As an aerospace company, we may become a party to litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including, among others, matters alleging product liability, warranty claims, breach of commercial or government contract or other legal actions. In general, litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact results of operations and financial condition.Currently, our subsidiary, AES is a defendant in actions filed in various jurisdictions by Lufthansa Technik AG relating to an allegation of patent infringement and based on rulings to date we have concluded that losses related to these proceedings are probable. If these actions are decided adversely against the Company, the associated damages could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Refer to Note 19 of our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for discussion on this and other legal proceedings. Other than these proceedings, we are not party to any significant pending legal proceedings that management believes will result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 13Our operations in foreign countries expose us to political and currency risks and adverse changes in local legal and regulatory environments. In 2020, approximately 10% of our sales were made by our subsidiaries in foreign countries, predominately in our subsidiaries in France and Canada. Net assets held by our foreign subsidiaries total $63.3 million at December 31, 2020. Approximately 25% of our consolidated sales in 2020 were made to customers outside of the United States. Our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies and by the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local currencies into U.S. dollars. We expect international operations and export sales to continue to contribute to our earnings for the foreseeable future. Both the sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside of the U.S. Such risks include the possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations, changes in tariff and trade barriers and import or export licensing requirements, and political or economic reprioritization, insurrection, civil disturbance or war.Government regulations could limit our ability to sell our products outside the U.S. and could otherwise adversely affect our business. Certain of our sales are subject to compliance with U.S. export regulations. Our failure to obtain, or fully adhere to the limitations contained in, the requisite licenses, meet registration standards or comply with other government export regulations would hinder our ability to generate sales of our products outside the U.S. Compliance with these government regulations may also subject us to additional fees and operating costs. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In order to sell our products in European Union countries, we must satisfy certain technical requirements. If we are unable to comply with those requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products, our sales in Europe would be restricted. Doing business internationally also subjects us to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, foreign corrupt practices and anti-boycott provisions. Our failure, or failure by an authorized agent or representative that is attributable to us, to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in monetary penalties, suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which would have a material adverse effect on us.General RisksOur future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team and technical personnel. The loss of members of our management team could have a material and adverse effect on our business. In addition, competition for qualified technical personnel in our industry is intense, and we believe that our future growth and success will depend on our ability to attract, train and retain such personnel.Future terror attacks, war, or other civil disturbances could negatively impact our business. Continued terror attacks, war or other disturbances could lead to economic instability and decreases in demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Terrorist attacks world-wide have caused instability from time to time in global financial markets and the aviation industry. The long-term effects of terrorist attacks on us are unknown. These attacks and the U.S. government’s continued efforts against terrorist organizations may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the U.S. or elsewhere, which may further contribute to economic instability.If we fail to meet expectations of securities analysts or investors due to fluctuations in our sales or operating results, our stock price could decline significantly. Our sales and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including delays or cancellations of programs and the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. In this event, the trading price of our stock could decline significantly.Our stock price is volatile. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our stock price ranged from a low of $6.40 to a high of $28.92. The price of our common stock has been and likely will continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of events and factors, such as:•quarterly variations in operating results;•variances of our quarterly results of operations from securities analyst estimates;•changes in financial estimates;•announcements of technological innovations and new products;•news reports relating to trends in our markets;•the cancellation of major contracts or programs with our customers; and•impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the aerospace industry and our Company.In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for companies in the aerospace and defense industry in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies affected by these fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our 14common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Global health crises, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, with the breadth of its impact worldwide, and particularly on the aerospace industry, could also cause significant volatility in the market price"
7,ATRO,ASTRONICS CORP,2020-03-02,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThe loss of Boeing or Panasonic as major customers or a significant reduction in business with either of those customers would reduce our sales and earnings. In 2019, we had a concentration of sales to Boeing and Panasonic representing approximately 13.6% and 13.0% of our sales, respectively. The loss of either of these customers or a significant reduction in business with them would significantly reduce our sales and earnings.In October 2018 and March of 2019, two commercial aircraft accidents led to the grounding by the Federal Aviation Administration and other regulators of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, on which we have significant content. The grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX, which started in March of 2019, has caused the production rate of that aircraft to be lower than expected in fiscal year 2019. The ongoing 737 MAX grounding affects our business both because of the production pause, impacting our line-fit content, and because it leaves many of our airline customers short of capacity, which makes them reluctant to take other aircraft out of service to install the types of retrofit products they buy from us. Although we expect, based on information that Boeing has made publicly available, that deliveries of the 737 MAX program will resume and that the demand for the aircraft in the long-term has not changed, a prolonged or permanent grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX could substantially decrease our Aerospace segment sales in the near or long-term, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Even if deliveries of the 737 MAX program resume, demand for the aircraft could be lower than was expected prior to the initial grounding of the aircraft.A write-off of all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our operating results and net worth. At December 31, 2019, goodwill and net intangible assets were approximately 18.5% and 16.3% of our total assets, respectively. In 2019, we recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $1.6 million and $6.2 million related to our AeroSat antenna business, respectively. Our goodwill and other intangible assets may increase in the future since our strategy includes growing through acquisitions. We may have to write-off all or part of our goodwill or purchased intangible assets if their value becomes impaired. Although this write-off would not result in an outlay of cash, it could reduce our earnings and net worth significantly.The markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and events, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate. Demand for our products is, to a large extent, dependent on the demand and success of our customers' products where we are a supplier to an OEM. In our Aerospace segment, demand by the business jet markets for our products is dependent upon several factors, including capital investment, product innovations, economic growth and wealth creation and technology upgrades. In addition, the commercial airline industry is highly cyclical and sensitive to such things as fuel price increases, labor disputes, global economic conditions, availability of capital to fund new aircraft purchases and upgrades of existing aircraft and passenger demand. A change in any of these factors could result in a reduction in the amount of air travel and the ability of airlines to invest in new aircraft or to upgrade existing aircraft. These factors would reduce orders for new aircraft and would likely reduce airlines’ spending for cabin upgrades for which we supply products, thus 7reducing our sales and profits. A reduction in air travel may also result in our commercial airline customers being unable to pay our invoices on a timely basis or not at all.We are a supplier on various new aircraft programs just entering or expected to begin production in the future. As with any new program, there is risk as to whether the aircraft or program will be successful and accepted by the market. As is customary for our business, we purchase inventory and invest in specific capital equipment to support our production requirements generally based on delivery schedules provided by our customer. If a program or aircraft is not successful, we may have to write-off all or a part of the inventory, accounts receivable and capital equipment related to the program. A write-off of these assets could result in a significant reduction of earnings and cause covenant violations relating to our debt agreements. This could result in our being unable to borrow additional funds under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness.In our Test Systems segment, the market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment. In any one reporting period, a single customer or several customers may contribute an even larger percentage of our consolidated sales. In addition, our ability to increase sales will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers. The opportunities to obtain orders from these customers may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow sales. We expect that sales of our Test Systems products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future. Additionally, demand for some of our test products is dependent upon government funding levels for our products, our ability to compete successfully for those contracts and our ability to develop products to satisfy the demands of our customers.Our products are sold in highly competitive markets. Some of our competitors are larger, more diversified corporations and have greater financial, marketing, production and research and development resources. As a result, they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns. Our operations and financial performance will be negatively impacted if our competitors:•develop products that are superior to our products;•develop products that are more competitively priced than our products;•develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services; or•adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.We believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality, price, design and engineering capabilities, product development, conformity to customer specifications, quality of support after the sale, timeliness of delivery and effectiveness of the distribution organization. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. If we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments, or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position, our operations and financial performance will suffer.Our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team and technical personnel. The loss of members of our management team could have a material and adverse effect on our business. In addition, competition for qualified technical personnel in our industry is intense, and we believe that our future growth and success will depend on our ability to attract, train and retain such personnel.We may incur losses and liabilities as a result of our acquisition strategy. Growth by acquisition involves risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results, including:•diversion of management time and attention from our core business;•the potential exposure to unanticipated liabilities;•the potential that expected benefits or synergies are not realized and that operating costs increase;•the risks associated with incurring additional acquisition indebtedness, including that additional indebtedness could limit our cash flow availability for operations and our flexibility;•difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies; and•the potential loss of key employees, suppliers or customers of acquired businesses.8In addition, any acquisition, once successfully integrated, could negatively impact our financial performance if it does not perform as planned, does not increase earnings, or does not prove otherwise to be beneficial to us.We currently are involved or may become involved in the future, in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could materially impact our financial condition. As an aerospace company, we may become a party to litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including, among others, matters alleging product liability, warranty claims, breach of commercial or government contract or other legal actions. In general, litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact results of operations and financial condition.Currently, our subsidiary, AES is a defendant in actions filed in various jurisdictions by Lufthansa Technik AG relating to an allegation of patent infringement and based on rulings to date we have concluded that losses related to these proceedings are probable. Refer to Note 19 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for discussion on the legal proceedings. If these actions are decided adversely against the Company, the associated damages could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Other than these proceedings, we are not party to any significant pending legal proceedings that management believes will result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. The amount of debt we have outstanding, as well as any debt we may incur in the future, could have an adverse effect on our operational and financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $188.2 million of debt outstanding of which $188.0 million is long-term debt. Changes to our level of debt subsequent to December 31, 2019 could have significant consequences to our business, including the following:•Depending on interest rates and debt maturities, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to paying principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for our acquisition strategy, capital expenditures or other purposes;•A significant amount of additional debt could make us more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions or increases in prevailing interest rates;•Our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, capital expenditures or for other purposes could be impaired;•The increase in the amount of debt we have outstanding increases the risk of non-compliance with some of the covenants in our debt agreements which require us to maintain specified financial ratios; and•We may be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may result in a competitive disadvantage.We are subject to debt covenant restrictions. Our credit facility contains certain financial and other restrictive covenants. A significant decline in our operating income could cause us to violate our covenants. A covenant violation would require a waiver by the lenders or an alternative financing arrangement be achieved. This could result in our being unable to borrow under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance and renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness. Historically both choices have been available to us, however, it is difficult to predict the availability of these options in the future.We are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks that could adversely affect our business, liquidity and operating results. Changes in the availability, terms and cost of capital, and increases in interest rates could cause our cost of doing business to increase and place us at a competitive disadvantage. At December 31, 2019, substantially all of our debt was subject to variable interest rates.The potential phase out of LIBOR may negatively impact our debt agreements and financial position, results of operations and liquidity. On July 27, 2017, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established or whether different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness will develop. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our debt agreements that extend beyond 2021 that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate, which may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness. In addition, the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial markets could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.Our future operating results could be impacted by estimates used to calculate impairment losses on long-lived assets. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant and subjective estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of long-lived assets in the 9financial statements. These estimates are integral in the determination of whether a potential non-cash impairment loss exists as well as the calculation of that loss. Actual future results could differ from those estimates. As discussed in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we recorded long-lived asset impairment losses of $9.5 million (excluding goodwill impairment, which has been previously discussed) in connection with the AeroSat restructuring.Future terror attacks, war, or other civil disturbances could negatively impact our business. Continued terror attacks, war or other disturbances could lead to economic instability and decreases in demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Terrorist attacks world-wide have caused instability from time to time in global financial markets and the aviation industry. The long-term effects of terrorist attacks on us are unknown. These attacks and the U.S. government’s continued efforts against terrorist organizations may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the U.S. or elsewhere, which may further contribute to economic instability.General business conditions are vulnerable to the effects of epidemics, such as the COVID-19 coronavirus, which could materially disrupt our business. We are vulnerable to the global economic effects of epidemics and other public health crises, such as the novel strain of COVID-19 virus reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China in 2019. Due to the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, there has been a substantial curtailment of global travel and business activities which could have an impact on airline spending and demand, and could negatively impact our sales if conditions worsen or extend for a prolonged period of time. China has also limited the shipment of products in and out of its borders, which could negatively impact our ability to receive products from our China-based suppliers and our ability to ship products to customers in that region. Supply chain disruptions could negatively impact our sales. If not resolved quickly, the impact of the epidemic could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our business and operations could be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology infrastructure or adversely impacted by a successful cyber-attack. We are dependent on various information technologies throughout our company to administer, store and support multiple business activities. We routinely experience various cybersecurity threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure, unauthorized attempts to gain access to our company sensitive information, and denial-of-service attacks as do our customers, suppliers and subcontractors. We conduct regular periodic training of our employees as to the protection of sensitive information which includes security awareness training intended to prevent the success of “phishing” attacks. The threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, including nation states, which target us and other defense contractors because we protect sensitive information. If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures, and depending on the severity of the incident, our customers’ data, our employees’ data, our intellectual property, and other third-party data (such as subcontractors, suppliers and vendors) could be compromised. As a consequence of their persistence, sophistication and volume, we may not be successful in defending against all such attacks. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.Although we work cooperatively with our customers, suppliers, and subcontractors to seek to minimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by these entities, which may affect the security of our information. These entities have varying levels of cybersecurity expertise and safeguards and their relationships with U.S. government contractors, such as Astronics, may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber threats we face. Our inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property or defend against assertions of infringement could prevent or restrict our ability to compete. We rely on patents, trademarks and proprietary knowledge and technology, both internally developed and acquired, in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Our inability to defend against the unauthorized use of these rights and assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against claims of infringement. This litigation could result in significant costs and divert our management’s focus away from operations. Refer to the risk factor related to pending patent infringement litigation above and Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.If we are unable to adapt to technological change, demand for our products may be reduced. The technologies related to our products have undergone, and in the future may undergo, significant changes. To succeed in the future, we will need to continue to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis. Our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we develop or that render our technology and products obsolete or uncompetitive. Furthermore, our products could become unmarketable if 10new industry standards emerge. We may have to modify our products significantly in the future to remain competitive, and new products we introduce may not be accepted by our customers.Our new product development efforts may not be successful, which would result in a reduction in our sales and earnings. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development of new products or product enhancements, and new products or product enhancements may not be accepted by our customers. In addition, the development expenses we incur may exceed our cost estimates, and new products we develop may not generate sales sufficient to offset our costs. If any of these events occur, our sales and profits could be adversely affected.We depend on government contracts and subcontracts with defense prime contractors and subcontractors that may not be fully funded, may be terminated, or may be awarded to our competitors. The failure to be awarded these contracts, the failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales. Sales to the U.S. government and its prime contractors and subcontractors represent a significant portion of our business. The funding of these programs is generally subject to annual congressional appropriations, and congressional priorities are subject to change. In addition, government expenditures for defense programs may decline or these defense programs may be terminated. A decline in governmental expenditures or the termination of existing contracts may result in a reduction in the volume of contracts awarded to us. We have resources applied to specific government contracts and if any of those contracts were terminated, we may incur substantial costs redeploying those resources.If our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our prime contract performance and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted. Many of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor. Failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide, on a timely basis, the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations with our customer and could result in the assessment of late delivery penalties. Subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, a delay in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may affect our ability to meet our customers’ needs and may have an adverse effect upon our profitability.Our results of operations are affected by our fixed-price contracts, which could subject us to losses in the event that we have cost overruns. For the year ended December 31, 2019, fixed-price contracts represented almost all of the Company’s sales. On fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the scope of work specified in the contract for a predetermined price. Depending on the fixed price negotiated, these contacts may provide us with an opportunity to achieve higher profits based on the relationship between our costs and the contract’s fixed price. However, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit.Some of our contracts contain late delivery penalties. Failure to deliver in a timely manner due to supplier problems, development schedule slides, manufacturing difficulties, or similar schedule-related events could have a material adverse effect on our business.The failure of our products may damage our reputation, necessitate a product recall or result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages. Defects in the design and manufacture of our products may necessitate a product recall. We include complex system design and components in our products that could contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products. If any of our products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. Such an event could result in significant expenses, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products. We are also exposed to product liability claims. We carry aircraft and non-aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms. However, this insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover the payment of any potential claim. A product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in discount rates and other estimates could affect our future earnings and equity. Our goodwill asset impairment evaluations are determined using valuations that involve several assumptions, including discount rates, cash flow estimates, growth rates and terminal values. Certain of these assumptions, particularly the discount rate, are based on market conditions and are outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity.Additionally, pension obligations and the related costs are determined using actual results and actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions. The most critical assumption is the discount rate. Other assumptions include mortality, salary increases 11and retirement age. The discount rate assumptions are based on current market conditions and are outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity. Contracting in the defense industry is subject to significant regulation, including rules related to bidding, billing and accounting kickbacks and false claims, and any non-compliance could subject us to fines and penalties or possible debarment. Like all government contractors, we are subject to risks associated with this contracting. These risks include the potential for substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in suspension or debarment from future government contracts.If we fail to meet expectations of securities analysts or investors due to fluctuations in our sales or operating results, our stock price could decline significantly. Our sales and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including delays or cancellations of programs. It is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. In this event, the trading price of our stock could decline significantly.Our operations in foreign countries expose us to political and currency risks and adverse changes in local legal and regulatory environments. In 2019, approximately 11% of our sales were made by our subsidiaries in foreign countries, predominately in our subsidiaries in France and Canada. Net assets held by these two subsidiaries total $64.3 million at December 31, 2019. Approximately 25% of our consolidated sales in 2019 were made to customers outside of the United States. Our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies and by the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local currencies into U.S. dollars. We expect international operations and export sales to continue to contribute to our earnings for the foreseeable future. Both the sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside of the U.S. Such risks include the possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations, changes in tariff and trade barriers and import or export licensing requirements, and political or economic reprioritization, insurrection, civil disturbance or war.Government regulations could limit our ability to sell our products outside the U.S. and could otherwise adversely affect our business. Certain of our sales are subject to compliance with U.S. export regulations. Our failure to obtain, or fully adhere to the limitations contained in, the requisite licenses, meet registration standards or comply with other government export regulations would hinder our ability to generate sales of our products outside the U.S. Compliance with these government regulations may also subject us to additional fees and operating costs. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In order to sell our products in European Union countries, we must satisfy certain technical requirements. If we are unable to comply with those requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products, our sales in Europe would be restricted. Doing business internationally also subjects us to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, foreign corrupt practices and anti-boycott provisions. Our failure, or failure by an authorized agent or representative that is attributable to us, to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in monetary penalties, suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which would have a material adverse effect on us.Our stock price is volatile. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our stock price ranged from a low of $26.08 to a high of $44.20. The price of our common stock has been and likely will continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of events and factors, such as:•quarterly variations in operating results;•variances of our quarterly results of operations from securities analyst estimates;•changes in financial estimates;•announcements of technological innovations and new products;•news reports relating to trends in our markets; and•the cancellation of major contracts or programs with our customers.In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for companies in the aerospace and defense industry in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies affected by these fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.12"
2,ATRO,ASTRONICS CORP,2019-03-01,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThe loss of Panasonic or Boeing as major customers or a significant reduction in business with either of those customers would reduce our sales and earnings. In 2018, we had a concentration of sales to Panasonic and Boeing representing approximately 14.4% and 14.3% of our sales, respectively. The loss of either of these customers or a significant reduction in business with them would significantly reduce our sales and earnings.A write-off of all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our operating results and net worth. At December 31, 2018, goodwill and net intangible assets were approximately 16.1% and 17.2% of our total assets, respectively. Our goodwill and other intangible assets may increase in the future since our strategy includes growing through acquisitions. We may have to write-off all or part of our goodwill or purchased intangible assets if their value becomes impaired. Although this write-off would be a non-cash charge, it could reduce our earnings and net worth significantly.The markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and events, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate. Demand for our products is, to a large extent, dependent on the demand and success of our customers' products where we are a supplier to an OEM. In our Aerospace segment, demand by the business jet markets for our products is dependent upon several factors, including capital investment, product innovations, economic growth and wealth creation and technology upgrades. In addition, the commercial airline industry is highly cyclical and sensitive to fuel price increases, labor disputes, global economic conditions, availability of capital to fund new aircraft purchases and upgrades of existing aircraft and passenger demand. A change in any of these factors could result in a reduction in the amount of air travel and the ability of airlines to invest in new aircraft or to upgrade existing aircraft. These factors would reduce orders for new aircraft and would likely reduce airlines’ spending for cabin upgrades for which we supply products, thus reducing our sales and profits. A reduction in air travel may also result in our commercial airline customers being unable to pay our invoices on a timely basis or not at all.We are a supplier on various new aircraft programs just entering or expected to begin production in the future. As with any new program, there is risk as to whether the aircraft or program will be successful and accepted by the market. As is customary for our business, we purchase inventory and invest in specific capital equipment to support our production requirements generally based on delivery schedules provided by our customer. If a program or aircraft is not successful, we may have to write-off all or a part of the inventory, accounts receivable and capital equipment related to the program. A write-off of these assets could result in a significant reduction of earnings and cause covenant violations relating to our debt agreements. This could result in our being unable to borrow additional funds under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness.In our Test Systems segment, the market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment. In any one reporting period, a single customer or several customers may contribute an even larger percentage of our consolidated sales. In addition, our ability to increase sales will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers. The opportunities to obtain orders from these customers may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow sales. We expect that sales of our Test Systems products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future. Additionally, demand for some of our test products is dependent upon government funding levels for our products, our ability to compete successfully for those contracts and our ability to develop products to satisfy the demands of our customers.7Our products are sold in highly competitive markets. Some of our competitors are larger, more diversified corporations and have greater financial, marketing, production and research and development resources. As a result, they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns. Our operations and financial performance will be negatively impacted if our competitors:•develop products that are superior to our products;•develop products that are more competitively priced than our products;•develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services; or•adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.We believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality, price, design and engineering capabilities, product development, conformity to customer specifications, quality of support after the sale, timeliness of delivery and effectiveness of the distribution organization. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. If we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments, or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position, our operations and financial performance will suffer.Our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team and technical personnel. The loss of members of our management team could have a material and adverse effect on our business. In addition, competition for qualified technical personnel in our industry is intense, and we believe that our future growth and success will depend on our ability to attract, train and retain such personnel.We may incur losses and liabilities as a result of our acquisition strategy. Growth by acquisition involves risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results, including:•diversion of management time and attention from our core business;•the potential exposure to unanticipated liabilities;•the potential that expected benefits or synergies are not realized and that operating costs increase;•the risks associated with incurring additional acquisition indebtedness, including that additional indebtedness could limit our cash flow availability for operations and our flexibility;•difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies; and•the potential loss of key employees, suppliers or customers of acquired businesses.In addition, any acquisition, once successfully integrated, could negatively impact our financial performance if it does not perform as planned, does not increase earnings, or does not prove otherwise to be beneficial to us.We currently are involved or may become involved in the future, in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could materially impact our financial condition. As an aerospace company, we may become a party to litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including, among others, matters alleging product liability, warranty claims, breach of commercial or government contract or other legal actions. In general, litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact results of operations and financial condition.We are a defendant in actions filed in the Regional State Court of Mannheim, Germany (Lufthansa Technik AG v. Astronics Advanced Electronics Systems Corp.) relating to an allegation of patent infringement. On December 29, 2010, Lufthansa Technik AG (“Lufthansa”) filed a Statement of Claim in the Regional State Court of Mannheim, Germany. Lufthansa’s claim asserts that our subsidiary, AES, sold, marketed, and brought into use in Germany a power supply system that infringes upon a German patent held by Lufthansa. Lufthansa sought an order requiring AES to stop selling and marketing the allegedly infringing power supply system, a recall of allegedly infringing products sold to commercial customers in Germany since November 26, 2003, and compensation for damages related to direct sales of the allegedly infringing power supply system in Germany (referred to as “direct sales”). The claim does not specify an estimate of damages and a related damages claim is being pursued by Lufthansa in separate court proceedings in an action filed in July 2017, as further discussed below. In February 2015, the Regional State Court of Mannheim, Germany rendered its decision that the patent was infringed. The judgment does not require AES to recall products that are already installed in aircraft or have been sold to other end users. On8 July 15, 2015, Lufthansa advised AES of their intention to enforce the accounting provisions of the decision, which required AES to provide certain financial information regarding direct sales of the infringing product in Germany to enable Lufthansa to make an estimate of requested damages. Additionally, if Lufthansa provides the required bank guarantee specified in the decision, the Company may be required to offer a recall of products that are in the distribution channels in Germany. No such bank guarantee has been issued to date. As of December 31, 2018 there are no products subject to the order in the distribution channels in Germany.The Company appealed to the Higher Regional Court of Karlsruhe. On November 15, 2016, the Court issued its ruling and upheld the lower court’s decision. The Company submitted a petition to grant AES leave for appeal to the German Federal Supreme Court. On April 18, 2018, the German Federal Supreme Court granted Astronics’ petition in part, namely with respect to the part concerning the amount of damages. On January 8, 2019, Federal Supreme Court held the hearing on the appeal. A decision on the Company's appeal is expected in late March 2019.In July 2017, Lufthansa filed an action in the Regional State Court of Mannheim for payment of damages caused by the alleged patent infringement of AES, related to direct sales of the allegedly infringing product in Germany (associated with the original December 2010 action discussed above). In this action, which was served on AES on April 11, 2018, Lufthansa claims payment of approximately $6.2 million plus interest. According to AES's assessment, this claim is significantly higher than justified. We estimate AES’s potential exposure to be approximately $1 million to $3 million, and have recorded a reserve of $1 million associated with this matter. Such amount is recorded within Other Accrued Expenses and Selling, General and Administrative Expenses in the accompanying financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018. An oral hearing in this matter has been scheduled for March 15, 2019. A first instance decision in this matter is expected in mid-2019.On December 29, 2017, Lufthansa filed another infringement action against AES in the Regional State Court of Mannheim claiming that sales by AES to its international customers have infringed Lufthansa's patent if AES's customers later shipped the products to Germany (referred to as “indirect sales”). This action, therefore, addresses sales other than those covered by the action filed on December 29, 2010, discussed above. In this action, served on April 11, 2018, Lufthansa seeks an injunction, an order obliging AES to provide information and accounting and a finding that AES owes damages for the attacked indirect sales. AES will vigorously defend against the action. No amount of claimed damages has been specified by Lufthansa and such amount is not quantifiable at this time. An oral hearing in this matter has been scheduled for March 15, 2019. A first instance decision is in this matter is expected in mid-2019. As loss exposure is neither probable nor estimable at this time, the Company has not recorded any liability with respect to this litigation as of December 31, 2018.In December 2017, Lufthansa filed patent infringement cases in the United Kingdom and France against AES. The Lufthansa patent expired in May 2018. In those cases, Lufthansa accuses AES of having manufactured, used, sold and offered for sale a power supply system, and offered and supplied parts for a power supply system, that infringed upon a Lufthansa patent in those respective countries. As loss exposure is neither probable nor estimable at this time, the Company has not recorded any liability with respect to these matters as of December 31, 2018. On November 26, 2014, Lufthansa filed a complaint in the United States District for the Western District of Washington. Lufthansa’s complaint in that action alleges that AES manufactures, uses, sells and offers for sale a power supply system that infringes upon a U.S. patent held by Lufthansa. The patent at issue in the U.S. action is based on technology similar to that involved in the German action. On April 25, 2016, the Court issued its ruling on claim construction, holding that the sole independent claim in the patent is indefinite, rendering all claims in the patent indefinite. Based on this ruling, AES filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the Court’s ruling that the patent is indefinite renders the patent invalid and unenforceable. On July 20, 2016, the U.S. District Court granted the motion for summary judgment and issued an order dismissing all claims against AES with prejudice.Lufthansa appealed the District Court's decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On October 19, 2017, the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision, holding that the sole independent claim of the patent is indefinite, rending all claims on the patent indefinite. Lufthansa did not file a petition for en banc rehearing or petition the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. Therefore, there is no longer a risk of exposure from that lawsuit.Other than these proceedings, we are not party to any significant pending legal proceedings that management believes will result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.The amount of debt we have outstanding, as well as any debt we may incur in the future, could have an adverse effect on our operational and financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $234.0 million of debt outstanding,9 of which $232.1 million is long-term debt. Changes to our level of debt subsequent to December 31, 2018 could have significant consequences to our business, including the following:•Depending on interest rates and debt maturities, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to paying principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for our acquisition strategy, capital expenditures or other purposes;•A significant amount of additional debt could make us more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions or increases in prevailing interest rates;•Our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, capital expenditures or for other purposes could be impaired;•The increase in the amount of debt we have outstanding increases the risk of non-compliance with some of the covenants in our debt agreements which require us to maintain specified financial ratios; and•We may be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may result in a competitive disadvantage.We are subject to debt covenant restrictions. Our credit facility contains certain financial and other restrictive covenants. A significant decline in our operating income could cause us to violate our covenants. A covenant violation would require a waiver by the lenders or an alternative financing arrangement be achieved. This could result in our being unable to borrow under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance and renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness. Historically both choices have been available to us, however, it is difficult to predict the availability of these options in the future.We are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks that could adversely affect our business, liquidity and operating results. Changes in the availability, terms and cost of capital, and increases in interest rates could cause our cost of doing business to increase and place us at a competitive disadvantage. At December 31, 2018, approximately 3% of our debt was at fixed interest rates with the remainder subject to variable interest rates.Our future operating results could be impacted by estimates used to calculate impairment losses on long lived assets. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant and subjective estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of long lived assets in the financial statements. These estimates are integral in the determination of whether a potential non-cash impairment loss exists as well as the calculation of that loss. Actual future results could differ from those estimates.Future terror attacks, war, or other civil disturbances could negatively impact our business. Continued terror attacks, war or other disturbances could lead to economic instability and decreases in demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Terrorist attacks world-wide have caused instability from time to time in global financial markets and the aviation industry. The long-term effects of terrorist attacks on us are unknown. These attacks and the U.S. government’s continued efforts against terrorist organizations may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the U.S. or elsewhere, which may further contribute to economic instability.Our business and operations could be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology infrastructure or adversely impacted by a successful cyber-attack. We are dependent on various information technologies throughout our company to administer, store and support multiple business activities. We routinely experience various cybersecurity threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure, unauthorized attempts to gain access to our company sensitive information, and denial-of-service attacks as do our customers, suppliers and subcontractors. We conduct regular periodic training of our employees as to the protection of sensitive information which includes security awareness training intended to prevent the success of “phishing” attacks. The threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, including nation states, which target us and other defense contractors because we protect sensitive information. If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures, and depending on the severity of the incident, our customers’ data, our employees’ data, our intellectual property, and other third party data (such as subcontractors, suppliers and vendors) could be compromised. As a consequence of their persistence, sophistication and volume, we may not be successful in defending against all such attacks. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.Although we work cooperatively with our customers, suppliers, and subcontractors to seek to minimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by these entities, which may affect the security of our information. These entities have varying levels of cyber security expertise and safeguards and their10 relationships with U.S. government contractors, such as Astronics, may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber threats we face. Our inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property or defend against assertions of infringement could prevent or restrict our ability to compete. We rely on patents, trademarks and proprietary knowledge and technology, both internally developed and acquired, in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Our inability to defend against the unauthorized use of these rights and assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against claims of infringement. This litigation could result in significant costs and divert our management’s focus away from operations.If we are unable to adapt to technological change, demand for our products may be reduced. The technologies related to our products have undergone, and in the future may undergo, significant changes. To succeed in the future, we will need to continue to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis. Our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we develop or that render our technology and products obsolete or uncompetitive. Furthermore, our products could become unmarketable if new industry standards emerge. We may have to modify our products significantly in the future to remain competitive, and new products we introduce may not be accepted by our customers.Our new product development efforts may not be successful, which would result in a reduction in our sales and earnings. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development of new products or product enhancements, and new products or product enhancements may not be accepted by our customers. In addition, the development expenses we incur may exceed our cost estimates, and new products we develop may not generate sales sufficient to offset our costs. If any of these events occur, our sales and profits could be adversely affected.We depend on government contracts and subcontracts with defense prime contractors and sub-contractors that may not be fully funded, may be terminated, or may be awarded to our competitors. The failure to be awarded these contracts, the failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales. Sales to the U.S. government and its prime contractors and subcontractors represent a significant portion of our business. The funding of these programs is generally subject to annual congressional appropriations, and congressional priorities are subject to change. In addition, government expenditures for defense programs may decline or these defense programs may be terminated. A decline in governmental expenditures or the termination of existing contracts may result in a reduction in the volume of contracts awarded to us. We have resources applied to specific government contracts and if any of those contracts were terminated, we may incur substantial costs redeploying those resources.If our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our prime contract performance and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted. Many of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor. Failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide, on a timely basis, the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations with our customer. Subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, a delay in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may affect our ability to meet our customers’ needs and may have an adverse effect upon our profitability.Our results of operations are affected by our fixed-price contracts, which could subject us to losses in the event that we have cost overruns. For the year ended December 31, 2018, fixed-price contracts represented almost all of the Company’s sales. On fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the scope of work specified in the contract for a predetermined price. Depending on the fixed price negotiated, these contacts may provide us with an opportunity to achieve higher profits based on the relationship between our costs and the contract’s fixed price. However, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit.Some of our contracts contain late delivery penalties. Failure to deliver in a timely manner due to supplier problems, development schedule slides, manufacturing difficulties, or similar schedule related events could have a material adverse effect on our business.The failure of our products may damage our reputation, necessitate a product recall or result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages. Defects in the design and manufacture of our products may necessitate a product recall. We include complex system design and components in our products that could contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products. If any of our products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. Such an11 event could result in significant expenses, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products. We are also exposed to product liability claims. We carry aircraft and non-aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms. However, this insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover the payment of any potential claim. A product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in discount rates and other estimates could affect our future earnings and equity. Our goodwill asset impairment evaluations are determined using valuations that involve several assumptions, including discount rates, cash flow estimates, growth rates and terminal values. Certain of these assumptions, particularly the discount rate, are based on market conditions and are outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity.Additionally, pension obligations and the related costs are determined using actual results and actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions. The most critical assumption is the discount rate. Other assumptions include mortality, salary increases and retirement age. The discount rate assumptions are based on current market conditions and are outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity. Contracting in the defense industry is subject to significant regulation, including rules related to bidding, billing and accounting kickbacks and false claims, and any non-compliance could subject us to fines and penalties or possible debarment. Like all government contractors, we are subject to risks associated with this contracting. These risks include the potential for substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in suspension or debarment from future government contracts.If we fail to meet expectations of securities analysts or investors due to fluctuations in our sales or operating results, our stock price could decline significantly. Our sales and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including delays or cancellations of programs. It is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. In this event, the trading price of our stock could decline significantly.Our operations in foreign countries expose us to political and currency risks and adverse changes in local legal and regulatory environments. In 2018, approximately 8.8% of our sales were made by our subsidiaries in France and Canada. Net assets held by these subsidiaries total $45.0 million at December 31, 2018. Our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies and by the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local currencies into U.S. dollars. We expect international operations and export sales to continue to contribute to our earnings for the foreseeable future. Both the sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside of the U.S. Such risks include the possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations, changes in tariff and trade barriers and import or export licensing requirements, and political or economic reprioritization, insurrection, civil disturbance or war.Government regulations could limit our ability to sell our products outside the U.S. and could otherwise adversely affect our business. Certain of our sales are subject to compliance with U.S. export regulations. Our failure to obtain, or fully adhere to the limitations contained in, the requisite licenses, meet registration standards or comply with other government export regulations would hinder our ability to generate sales of our products outside the U.S. Compliance with these government regulations may also subject us to additional fees and operating costs. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In order to sell our products in European Union countries, we must satisfy certain technical requirements. If we are unable to comply with those requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products, our sales in Europe would be restricted. Doing business internationally also subjects us to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, foreign corrupt practices and anti-boycott provisions. Our failure, or failure by an authorized agent or representative that is attributable to us, to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in monetary penalties, suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which would have a material adverse effect on us.Our stock price is volatile. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our stock price ranged from a low of $28.46 to a high of $41.18. The price of our common stock has been and likely will continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of events and factors, such as:•quarterly variations in operating results;•variances of our quarterly results of operations from securities analyst estimates;12•changes in financial estimates;•announcements of technological innovations and new products;•news reports relating to trends in our markets; and•the cancellation of major contracts or programs with our customers.In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for companies in the aerospace & defense industry in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies affected by these fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance"

In 2017, we had a concentration of sales to Panasonic and Boeing representing approximately 19.1% and 16.8% of our sales, respectively. The loss of either of these customers or a significant reduction in sales to them would significantly reduce our sales and earnings.The amount of debt we have outstanding, as well as any debt we may incur in the future, could have an adverse effect on our operational and financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $271.8 million of debt outstanding, of which $269.1 million is long-term debt. Changes to our level of debt subsequent to December 31, 2017 could have significant consequences to our business, including the following: •Depending on interest rates and debt maturities, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to paying principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for our acquisition strategy, capital expenditures or other purposes;•A significant amount of additional debt could make us more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions or increases in prevailing interest rates;•Our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, capital expenditures or for other purposes could be impaired;•The increase in the amount of debt we have outstanding increases the risk of non-compliance with some of the covenants in our debt agreements which require us to maintain specified financial ratios; and•We may be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may result in a competitive disadvantage.We are subject to debt covenant restrictions.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant and subjective estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of long lived assets in the financial statements. These estimates are integral in the determination of whether a potential non-cash impairment loss exists as well as the calculation of that loss. Actual future results could differ from those estimates.A write-off of all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our operating results and net worth. At December 31, 2017, goodwill and purchased intangible assets were approximately 17.1% and 20.9% of our total assets, respectively. Our goodwill and other intangible assets may increase in the future since our strategy includes growing through acquisitions. We may have to write-off all or part of our goodwill or purchased intangible assets if their value becomes impaired. Although this write-off would be a non-cash charge, it could reduce our earnings and net worth significantly.6The markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and events, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate. Demand for our products is, to a large extent, dependent on the demand and success of our customers' products where we are a supplier to an OEM. In our Aerospace segment, demand by the business jet markets for our products is dependent upon several factors, including capital investment, product innovations, economic growth and wealth creation and technology upgrades. In addition, the commercial airline industry is highly cyclical and sensitive to fuel price increases, labor disputes, global economic conditions, availability of capital to fund new aircraft purchases and upgrades of existing aircraft and passenger demand. A change in any of these factors could result in a reduction in the amount of air travel and the ability of airlines to invest in new aircraft or to upgrade existing aircraft. These factors would reduce orders for new aircraft and would likely reduce airlines’ spending for cabin upgrades for which we supply products, thus reducing our sales and profits. A reduction in air travel may also result in our commercial airline customers being unable to pay our invoices on a timely basis or not at all.We are a supplier on various new aircraft programs just entering or expected to begin production in the future. As with any new program, there is risk as to whether the aircraft or program will be successful and accepted by the market. As is customary for our business, we purchase inventory and invest in specific capital equipment to support our production requirements generally based on delivery schedules provided by our customer. If a program or aircraft is not successful, we may have to write-off all or a part of the inventory, accounts receivable and capital equipment related to the program. A write-off of these assets could result in a significant reduction of earnings and cause covenant violations relating to our debt agreements. This could result in our being unable to borrow additional funds under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness.In our Test Systems segment, the market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment. In any one reporting period, a single customer or several customers may contribute an even larger percentage of our consolidated revenues. In addition, our ability to increase sales will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers. The opportunities to obtain orders from these customers may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow revenues. We expect that sales of our Test Systems products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future. Additionally, demand for some of our test products is dependent upon government funding levels for our products, our ability to compete successfully for those contracts and our ability to develop products to satisfy the demands of our customers.Our products are sold in highly competitive markets. Some of our competitors are larger, more diversified corporations and have greater financial, marketing, production and research and development resources. As a result, they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns. Our operations and financial performance will be negatively impacted if our competitors: •develop products that are superior to our products;•develop products that are more competitively priced than our products;•develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services; or•adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.We believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality, price, design and engineering capabilities, product development, conformity to customer specifications, quality of support after the sale, timeliness of delivery and effectiveness of the distribution organization. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. If we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments, or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position, our operations and financial performance will suffer.Our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team and technical personnel. The loss of members of our management team could have a material and adverse effect on our business. In addition, competition for qualified technical personnel in our industry is intense, and we believe that our future growth and success will depend on our ability to attract, train and retain such personnel.Future terror attacks, war, or other civil disturbances could negatively impact our business. Continued terror attacks, war or other disturbances could lead to economic instability and decreases in demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Terrorist attacks world-wide have caused instability from time to time in global financial markets and the aviation industry. The long-term effects of terrorist attacks on us are unknown. These attacks and the U.S. government’s continued efforts against terrorist organizations may lead to additional armed 7hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the U.S. or elsewhere, which may further contribute to economic instability.Our business and operations could be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology infrastructure or adversely impacted by a successful cyber-attack. We are dependent on various information technologies throughout our company to administer, store and support multiple business activities. We routinely experience various cybersecurity threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure, unauthorized attempts to gain access to our company sensitive information, and denial-of-service attacks as do our customers, suppliers and subcontractors. We conduct regular periodic training of our employees as to the protection of sensitive information which includes security awareness training intended to prevent the success of “phishing” attacks. The threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, including nation states, which target us and other defense contractors because we protect sensitive information. If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures, and depending on the severity of the incident, our customers’ data, our employees’ data, our intellectual property, and other third party data (such as subcontractors, suppliers and vendors) could be compromised. As a consequence of their persistence, sophistication and volume, we may not be successful in defending against all such attacks. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.Although we work cooperatively with our customers, suppliers, and subcontractors to seek to minimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by these entities, which may affect the security of our information. These entities have varying levels of cyber security expertise and safeguards and their relationships with U.S. government contractors, such as Astronics, may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber threats we face. Our inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property or defend against assertions of infringement could prevent or restrict our ability to compete. We rely on patents, trademarks and proprietary knowledge and technology, both internally developed and acquired, in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Our inability to defend against the unauthorized use of these rights and assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against claims of infringement. This litigation could result in significant costs and divert our management’s focus away from operations.If we are unable to adapt to technological change, demand for our products may be reduced. The technologies related to our products have undergone, and in the future may undergo, significant changes. To succeed in the future, we will need to continue to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis. Our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we develop or that render our technology and products obsolete or uncompetitive. Furthermore, our products could become unmarketable if new industry standards emerge. We may have to modify our products significantly in the future to remain competitive, and new products we introduce may not be accepted by our customers.Our new product development efforts may not be successful, which would result in a reduction in our sales and earnings. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development of new products or product enhancements, and new products or product enhancements may not be accepted by our customers. In addition, the development expenses we incur may exceed our cost estimates, and new products we develop may not generate sales sufficient to offset our costs. If any of these events occur, our sales and profits could be adversely affected.We depend on government contracts and subcontracts with defense prime contractors and sub-contractors that may not be fully funded, may be terminated, or may be awarded to our competitors. The failure to be awarded these contracts, the failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales. Sales to the U.S. government and its prime contractors and subcontractors represent a significant portion of our business. The funding of these programs is generally subject to annual congressional appropriations, and congressional priorities are subject to change. In addition, government expenditures for defense programs may decline or these defense programs may be terminated. A decline in governmental expenditures or the termination of existing contracts may result in a reduction in the volume of contracts awarded to us. We have resources applied to specific government contracts and if any of those contracts were terminated, we may incur substantial costs redeploying those resources.If our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our prime contract performance and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted. Many of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers. 8There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor. Failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide, on a timely basis, the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations with our customer. Subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, a delay in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may affect our ability to meet our customers’ needs and may have an adverse effect upon our profitability.Our results of operations are affected by our fixed-price contracts, which could subject us to losses in the event that we have cost overruns. For the year ended December 31, 2017, fixed-price contracts represented almost all of the Company’s sales. On fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the scope of work specified in the contract for a predetermined price. Depending on the fixed price negotiated, these contacts may provide us with an opportunity to achieve higher profits based on the relationship between our costs and the contract’s fixed price. However, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit.Some of our contracts contain late delivery penalties. Failure to deliver in a timely manner due to supplier problems, development schedule slides, manufacturing difficulties, or similar schedule related events could have a material adverse effect on our business.The failure of our products may damage our reputation, necessitate a product recall or result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages. Defects in the design and manufacture of our products may necessitate a product recall. We include complex system design and components in our products that could contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products. If any of our products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. Such an event could result in significant expenses, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products. We are also exposed to product liability claims. We carry aircraft and non-aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms. However, this insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover the payment of any potential claim. A product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in discount rates and other estimates could affect our future earnings and equity. Our goodwill asset impairment evaluations are determined using valuations that involve several assumptions, including discount rates, cash flow estimates, growth rates and terminal values. Certain of these assumptions, particularly the discount rate, are based on market conditions and are outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity.Additionally, pension obligations and the related costs are determined using actual results and actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions. The most critical assumption is the discount rate. Other assumptions include mortality, salary increases and retirement age. The discount rate assumptions are based on current market conditions and are outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity. Contracting in the defense industry is subject to significant regulation, including rules related to bidding, billing and accounting kickbacks and false claims, and any non-compliance could subject us to fines and penalties or possible debarment. Like all government contractors, we are subject to risks associated with this contracting. These risks include the potential for substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in suspension or debarment from future government contracts.If we fail to meet expectations of securities analysts or investors due to fluctuations in our revenue or operating results, our stock price could decline significantly. Our revenue and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including delays or cancellations of programs. It is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. In this event, the trading price of our stock could decline significantly.Our operations in foreign countries expose us to political and currency risks and adverse changes in local legal and regulatory environments. In 2017, approximately 8.6% of our sales were made by our subsidiaries in France and Canada. Net assets held by these subsidiaries total $47.4 million at December 31, 2017. Our financial results may be adversely affected by 9fluctuations in foreign currencies and by the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local currencies into U.S. dollars. We expect international operations and export sales to continue to contribute to our earnings for the foreseeable future. Both the sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside of the U.S. Such risks include the possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations, changes in tariff and trade barriers and import or export licensing requirements, and political or economic reprioritization, insurrection, civil disturbance or war.Government regulations could limit our ability to sell our products outside the U.S. and could otherwise adversely affect our business. Certain of our sales are subject to compliance with U.S. export regulations. Our failure to obtain, or fully adhere to the limitations contained in, the requisite licenses, meet registration standards or comply with other government export regulations would hinder our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products outside the U.S. Compliance with these government regulations may also subject us to additional fees and operating costs. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In order to sell our products in European Union countries, we must satisfy certain technical requirements. If we are unable to comply with those requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products, our sales in Europe would be restricted. Doing business internationally also subjects us to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, foreign corrupt practices and anti-boycott provisions. Our failure, or failure by an authorized agent or representative that is attributable to us, to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in monetary penalties, suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which would have a material adverse effect on us.Our stock price is volatile. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our stock price ranged from a low of $25.13 to a high of $43.87. The price of our common stock has been and likely will continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of events and factors, such as: •quarterly variations in operating results;•variances of our quarterly results of operations from securities analyst estimates;•changes in financial estimates;•announcements of technological innovations and new products;•news reports relating to trends in our markets; and•the cancellation of major contracts or programs with our customers.In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for companies in the aerospace & defense industry in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies affected by these fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.We may incur losses and liabilities as a result of our acquisition strategy. Growth by acquisition involves risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results, including: •diversion of management time and attention from our core business;•the potential exposure to unanticipated liabilities;•the potential that expected benefits or synergies are not realized and that operating costs increase;•the risks associated with incurring additional acquisition indebtedness, including that additional indebtedness could limit our cash flow availability for operations and our flexibility;•difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies; and•the potential loss of key employees, suppliers or customers of acquired businesses.In addition, any acquisition, once successfully integrated, could negatively impact our financial performance if it does not perform as planned, does not increase earnings, or does not prove otherwise to be beneficial to us.10We currently are involved or may become involved in the future, in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could materially impact our financial condition. As an aerospace company, we may become a party to litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including, among others, matters alleging product liability, warranty claims, breach of commercial or government contract or other legal actions. In general, litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact results of operations and financial condition.We are a defendant in actions filed in the Regional State Court of Mannheim, Germany (Lufthansa Technik AG v. Astronics Advanced Electronics Systems Corp.) and the United States District for the Western District of Washington relating to an allegation of patent infringement. On December 29, 2010, Lufthansa Technik AG (“Lufthansa”) filed a Statement of Claim in the Regional State Court of Mannheim, Germany. Lufthansa’s claim asserts that our subsidiary, AES sold, marketed and brought into use in Germany a power supply system that infringes upon a German patent held by Lufthansa. The relief sought by Lufthansa includes requiring AES to stop selling and marketing the allegedly infringing power supply system, a recall of allegedly infringing products sold to commercial customers since November 26, 2003 and compensation for damages. The claim does not specify an estimate of damages and a damages claim will be made by Lufthansa only if it receives a favorable ruling on the determination of infringement.On February 6, 2015, the Regional State Court of Mannheim, Germany rendered its decision that the patent was infringed. The judgment does not require AES to recall products that are already installed in aircraft or have been sold to other end users.  On July 15, 2015, Lufthansa advised AES of their intention to enforce the accounting provisions of the decision, which required AES to provide certain financial information regarding sales of the infringing product to enable Lufthansa to make an estimate of requested damages. Additionally, if Lufthansa provides the required bank guarantee specified in the decision, the Company may be required to offer a recall of products that are in the distribution channels in Germany. No such bank guarantee has been issued to date. As of December 31, 2017 there are no products in the distribution channels in Germany.The Company appealed to the Higher Regional Court of Karlsruhe.  On November 15, 2016, the Court issued its ruling and upheld the lower court’s decision.  The Company has submitted a petition to grant AES leave for appeal to the Federal Supreme Court. The Company believes it has valid defenses to refute the decision.  Should the Federal Supreme Court decide to hear the case, the appeal process is estimated to extend up to two years. We estimate AES’s potential exposure related to this matter to be approximately $1 million to $3 million. As loss exposure is not probable at this time, the Company has not recorded any liability with respect to this litigation as of December 31, 2017.In December 2017, Lufthansa filed patent infringement cases in the United Kingdom and in France against AES. AES has been served in the case in France, but not in the case in the United Kingdom. In those cases, Lufthansa accuses AES of manufacturing, using, selling and offering for sale a power supply system that infringes upon a Lufthansa patent in those respective countries. As loss exposure is neither probable nor estimable at this time, the Company has not recorded any liability with respect to this litigation as of December 31, 2017. Other than these proceedings, we are not party to any significant pending legal proceedings that management believes will result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations"
10,ATRO,ASTRONICS CORP,2017-02-24,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSThe loss of Panasonic or Boeing as major customers or a significant reduction in sales to either of those customers would reduce our sales and earnings. In 2016, we had a concentration of sales to Panasonic and Boeing representing approximately 21.6% and 15.2% of our sales, respectively. The loss of either of these customers or a significant reduction in sales to them would significantly reduce our sales and earnings.The amount of debt we have outstanding, as well as any debt we may incur in the future, could have an adverse effect on our operational and financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $148.1 million of debt outstanding, of which $145.5 million is long-term debt. Changes to our level of debt subsequent to December 31, 2016 could have significant consequences to our business, including the following: •Depending on interest rates and debt maturities, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to paying principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for our acquisition strategy, capital expenditures or other purposes;•A significant amount of debt could make us more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions or increases in prevailing interest rates;•Our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, capital expenditures or for other purposes could be impaired;•The increase in the amount of debt we have outstanding increases the risk of non-compliance with some of the covenants in our debt agreements which require us to maintain specified financial ratios; and•We may be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may result in a competitive disadvantage.We are subject to debt covenant restrictions. Our credit facility contains several financial and other restrictive covenants. A significant decline in our operating income could cause us to violate our covenants. A covenant violation would require a waiver by the lenders or an alternative financing arrangement be achieved. This could result in our being unable to borrow under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance and renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness. Historically both choices have been available to us, however, it is difficult to predict the availability of these options in the future.Our future operating results could be impacted by estimates used to calculate impairment losses on long term assets. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant and subjective estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of long term assets in the financial statements. These estimates are integral in the determination of whether a potential impairment loss exists as well as the calculation of that loss. Actual future results could differ from those estimates.A write-off of all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our operating results and net worth. At December 31, 2016, goodwill and purchased intangible assets were approximately 35.3% and 36.7% of our total assets, respectively. Our goodwill and other intangible assets may increase in the future since our strategy includes growing through acquisitions. We may have to write-off all or part of our goodwill or purchased intangible assets if their value becomes impaired. Although this write-off would be a non-cash charge, it could reduce our earnings and net worth significantly.The markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and events, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate. Demand for our products is to a large extent dependent on the demand and success of our customers' products where we are a supplier to an OEM. In our Aerospace segment, demand by the business jet markets for our products is dependent upon several factors, including capital investment, product innovations, economic growth and wealth creation and technology upgrades. In addition, the commercial airline industry is highly cyclical and sensitive to fuel price increases, labor disputes, global economic conditions, availability of capital to fund new aircraft purchases and upgrades 6Table of Contentsof existing aircraft and passenger demand. A change in any of these factors could result in a reduction in the amount of air travel and the ability of airlines to invest in new aircraft or to upgrade existing aircraft. These factors would reduce orders for new aircraft and would likely reduce airlines’ spending for cabin upgrades for which we supply products, thus reducing our sales and profits. A reduction in air travel may also result in our commercial airline customers being unable to pay our invoices on a timely basis or not at all.We are a supplier on various new aircraft programs just entering or expected to begin production in the future. As with any new program, there is risk as to whether the aircraft or program will be successful and accepted by the market. As is customary for our business, we purchase inventory and invest in specific capital equipment to support our production requirements generally based on delivery schedules provided by our customer. If a program or aircraft is not successful we may have to write-off all or a part of the inventory, accounts receivable and capital equipment related to the program.

Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. If we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments, or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position, our operations and financial performance will suffer.Our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team and technical personnel. The loss of members of our management team could have a material and adverse effect on our business. In addition, competition for qualified technical personnel in our industry is intense, and we believe that our future growth and success will depend on our ability to attract, train and retain such personnel.Future terror attacks, war, or other civil disturbances could negatively impact our business. Continued terror attacks, war or other disturbances could lead to economic instability and decreases in demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Terrorist attacks world-wide have caused instability from time to time in global financial markets and the aviation industry. The long-term effects of terrorist attacks on us are unknown. These attacks and the U.S. government’s continued efforts against terrorist organizations may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the U.S. or elsewhere, which may further contribute to economic instability.Our business operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions or intrusions. We are dependent on various information technologies throughout our Company to administer, store and support multiple business activities. Disruptions or cyber security attacks such as unauthorized access, malicious software and other intrusions may lead to exposure 7Table of Contentsof proprietary and confidential information as well as potential data corruption. Any intrusion may cause operational stoppages, diminished competitive advantages through reputational damages and increased operational costs.Our inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property or defend against assertions of infringement could prevent or restrict our ability to compete. We rely on patents, trademarks and proprietary knowledge and technology, both internally developed and acquired, in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Our inability to defend against the unauthorized use of these rights and assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against claims of infringement.

Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity.Additionally, pension obligations and the related costs are determined using actual results and actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions. The most critical assumption is the discount rate. Other assumptions include mortality, salary increases and retirement age. The discount rate assumptions are based on current market conditions and are outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity. We are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks that could adversely affect our business, liquidity and operating results. Changes in the availability, terms and cost of capital, and increases in interest rates could cause our cost of doing business to increase and place us at a competitive disadvantage. At December 31, 2016, approximately 8% of our debt was at fixed interest rates with the remainder subject to variable interest rates.Contracting in the defense industry is subject to significant regulation, including rules related to bidding, billing and accounting kickbacks and false claims, and any non-compliance could subject us to fines and penalties or possible debarment. Like all government contractors, we are subject to risks associated with this contracting. These risks include the potential for substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in suspension or debarment from future government contracts.If we fail to meet expectations of securities analysts or investors due to fluctuations in our revenue or operating results, our stock price could decline significantly. Our revenue and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including delays or cancellations of programs. It is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. In this event, the trading price of our stock could decline significantly.Our operations in foreign countries expose us to political and currency risks and adverse changes in local legal and regulatory environments. In 2016, approximately 7.9% of our sales were made by our subsidiaries in France and Canada. Net assets held by these subsidiaries total $36.8 million at December 31, 2016. Our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies and by the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local currencies into U.S. dollars. We expect international operations and export sales to continue to contribute to our earnings for the foreseeable future. Both the sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside of the U.S. Such risks include the possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations, changes in tariff and trade barriers and import or export licensing requirements, and political or economic reprioritization, insurrection, civil disturbance or war.Government regulations could limit our ability to sell our products outside the U.S. and could otherwise adversely affect our business. Certain of our sales are subject to compliance with U.S. export regulations. Our failure to obtain, or fully adhere to the limitations contained in, the requisite licenses, meet registration standards or comply with other government export regulations would hinder our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products outside the U.S. Compliance with these government regulations may also subject us to additional fees and operating costs. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In order to sell our products in European Union countries, we must satisfy certain technical requirements. If we are unable to comply with those requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products, our sales in Europe would be restricted. Doing business internationally also subjects us to 9Table of Contentsnumerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, foreign corrupt practices and anti-boycott provisions. Our failure, or failure by an authorized agent or representative that is attributable to us, to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in monetary penalties, suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which would have a material adverse effect on us.Our stock price is volatile. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our stock price ranged from a low of $21.76 to a high of $40.70. The price of our common stock has been and likely will continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of events and factors, such as: •quarterly variations in operating results;•variances of our quarterly results of operations from securities analyst estimates;•changes in financial estimates;•announcements of technological innovations and new products;•news reports relating to trends in our markets; and•the cancellation of major contracts or programs with our customers.In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for companies in the aerospace & defense industry in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies affected by these fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.We may incur losses and liabilities as a result of our acquisition strategy. Growth by acquisition involves risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results, including: •diversion of management time and attention from our core business;•the potential exposure to unanticipated liabilities;•the potential that expected benefits or synergies are not realized and that operating costs increase;•the risks associated with incurring additional acquisition indebtedness, including that additional indebtedness could limit our cash flow availability for operations and our flexibility;•difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies; and•the potential loss of key employees, suppliers or customers of acquired businesses.In addition, any acquisition, once successfully integrated, could negatively impact our financial performance if it does not perform as planned, does not increase earnings, or does not prove otherwise to be beneficial to us.We currently are involved or may become involved in the future, in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could materially impact our financial condition. As an aerospace company, we may become a party to litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including, among others, matters alleging product liability, warranty claims, breach of commercial or government contract or other legal actions. In general, litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact results of operations and financial condition.We are a defendant in actions filed in the Regional State Court of Mannheim, Germany (Lufthansa Technik AG v. Astronics Advanced Electronics Systems Corp.) and the United States District for the Western District of Washington relating to an allegation of patent infringement. On December 29, 2010, Lufthansa Technik AG (“Lufthansa”) filed a Statement of Claim in the Regional State Court of Mannheim, Germany. Lufthansa’s claim asserts that our subsidiary, AES sold, marketed and brought into use in Germany a power supply system that infringes upon a German patent held by Lufthansa. The relief sought by Lufthansa includes requiring AES to stop selling and marketing the allegedly infringing power supply system, a recall of allegedly infringing products sold to commercial customers since November 26, 2003 and compensation for damages. The claim does not specify an estimate of damages and a damages claim will be made by Lufthansa only if it receives a favorable ruling on the determination of infringement.10Table of ContentsOn February 6, 2015, the Regional State Court of Mannheim, Germany rendered its decision that the patent was infringed. The judgment does not require AES to recall products that are already installed in aircraft or have been sold to other end users.  On July 15, 2015, Lufthansa advised AES of their intention to enforce the accounting provisions of the decision, which required AES to provide certain financial information regarding sales of the infringing product to enable Lufthansa to make an estimate of requested damages. Additionally, if Lufthansa provides the required bank guarantee specified in the decision, the Company may be required to offer a recall of products that are in the distribution channels in Germany. No such bank guarantee has been issued to date. As of December 31, 2016 there are no products in the distribution channels in Germany.The Company appealed to the Higher Regional Court of Karlsruhe.  On November 15, 2016, the Court issued its ruling and upheld the lower court’s decision.  The Company has submitted a petition to grant AES leave for appeal to the Federal Supreme Court. The Company believes it has valid defenses to refute the decision.  Should the Federal Supreme Court decide to hear the case, the appeal process is estimated to extend up to two years. We estimate AES’s potential exposure related to this matter to be approximately $1 million to $3 million. As loss exposure is not probable at this time, the Company has not recorded any liability with respect to this litigation as of December 31, 2016.On November 26, 2014, Lufthansa filed a complaint in the United States District for the Western District of Washington. Lufthansa’s complaint in this action alleges that AES manufactures, uses, sells and offers for sale a power supply system that infringes upon a U.S. patent held by Lufthansa. The patent at issue in the U.S. action is based on technology similar to that involved in the German action. On April 25, 2016, the Court issued its ruling on claim construction, holding that the sole independent claim in the patent is indefinite, rendering all claims in the patent indefinite. Based on this ruling, AES filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that the Court’s ruling that the patent is indefinite renders the patent invalid and unenforceable. On July 20, 2016, the U.S. District Court granted the motion for summary judgment and issued an order dismissing all claims against AES with prejudice. Lufthansa has filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Company believes that it has valid defenses to Lufthansa’s claims and will vigorously contest the appeal. As loss exposure is neither probable nor estimable at this time, the Company has not recorded any liability with respect to this litigation as of December 31, 2016.Other than these proceedings, we are not party to any significant pending legal proceedings that management believes will result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations"
13,ATRO,ASTRONICS CORP,2016-02-24,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORSThe loss of Panasonic, Apple or Boeing as major customers or a significant reduction in sales to any or all of those three customers would reduce our sales and earnings. In 2015, we had a concentration of sales to Panasonic, Apple and Boeing representing approximately 21.0%, 13.1% and 13.0% of our sales, respectively. The loss of one or all of these customers or a significant reduction in sales to them would significantly reduce our sales and earnings.The amount of debt we have outstanding, as well as any debt we may incur in the future, could have an adverse effect on our operational and financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $169.8 million of debt outstanding, of which $167.2 million is long-term debt. Changes to our level of debt subsequent to December 31, 2015 could have significant consequences to our business, including the following: •Depending on interest rates and debt maturities, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to paying principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for our acquisition strategy, capital expenditures or other purposes;•A significant amount of debt could make us more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions or increases in prevailing interest rates;•Our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, capital expenditures or for other purposes could be impaired;•The increase in the amount of debt we have outstanding increases the risk of non-compliance with some of the covenants in our debt agreements which require us to maintain specified financial ratios; and•We may be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may result in a competitive disadvantage.We are subject to debt covenant restrictions. Our credit facility contains several financial and other restrictive covenants. A significant decline in our operating income could cause us to violate our covenants. A covenant violation would require a waiver by the lenders or an alternative financing arrangement be achieved. This could result in our being unable to borrow under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance and renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness. Historically both choices have been available to us, however, it is difficult to predict the availability of these options in the future.Our future operating results could be impacted by estimates used to calculate impairment losses on long term assets. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant and subjective estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of long term assets in the 6Table of Contentsfinancial statements. These estimates are integral in the determination of whether a potential impairment loss exists as well as the calculation of that loss. Actual future results could differ from those estimates.A write-off of all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our operating results and net worth. At December 31, 2015, goodwill and purchased intangible assets were approximately 18.9% and 17.8% of our total assets, respectively. Our goodwill and other intangible assets may increase in the future since our strategy includes growing through acquisitions. We may have to write-off all or part of our goodwill or purchased intangible assets if their value becomes impaired. Although this write-off would be a non-cash charge, it could reduce our earnings and net worth significantly.The markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and events, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate. Demand for our products is to a large extent dependent on the demand and success of our customers' products where we are a supplier to an OEM. In our Aerospace segment, demand by the business jet markets for our products is dependent upon several factors, including capital investment, product innovations, economic growth and wealth creation and technology upgrades. In addition, the commercial airline industry is highly cyclical and sensitive to fuel price increases, labor disputes, global economic conditions, availability of capital to fund new aircraft purchases and upgrades of existing aircraft and passenger demand. A change in any of these factors could result in a reduction in the amount of air travel and the ability of airlines to invest in new aircraft or to upgrade existing aircraft. These factors would reduce orders for new aircraft and would likely reduce airlines’ spending for cabin upgrades for which we supply products, thus reducing our sales and profits. A reduction in air travel may also result in our commercial airline customers being unable to pay our invoices on a timely basis or not at all.We are a supplier on various new aircraft programs just entering or expected to begin production in the future. As with any new program, there is risk as to whether the aircraft or program will be successful and accepted by the market. As is customary for our business, we purchase inventory and invest in specific capital equipment to support our production requirements generally based on delivery schedules provided by our customer. If a program or aircraft is not successful we may have to write-off all or a part of the inventory, accounts receivable and capital equipment related to the program. A write-off of these assets could result in a significant reduction of earnings and cause covenant violations relating to our debt agreements. This could result in our being unable to borrow additional funds under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness.In our Test Systems segment, the market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment. In any one reporting period, a single customer or several customers may contribute an even larger percentage of our consolidated revenues. In addition, our ability to increase sales will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers. The opportunities to obtain orders from these customers may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow revenues. We expect that sales of our Test Systems products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future. Additionally, demand for some of our test products is dependent upon government funding levels for our products, our ability to compete successfully for those contracts and our ability to develop products to satisfy the demands of our customers.Our products are sold in highly competitive markets. Some of our competitors are larger, more diversified corporations and have greater financial, marketing, production and research and development resources. As a result, they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns. Our operations and financial performance will be negatively impacted if our competitors: •develop products that are superior to our products;•develop products that are more competitively priced than our products;•develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services; or•adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.We believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality, price, design and engineering capabilities, product development, conformity to customer specifications, quality of support after the sale, timeliness of delivery and effectiveness of the distribution organization. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. If we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments, or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position, our operations and financial performance will suffer.7Table of ContentsOur future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team and technical personnel. The loss of members of our management team could have a material and adverse effect on our business. In addition, competition for qualified technical personnel in our industry is intense, and we believe that our future growth and success will depend on our ability to attract, train and retain such personnel.Future terror attacks, war, or other civil disturbances could negatively impact our business. Continued terror attacks, war or other disturbances could lead to economic instability and decreases in demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Terrorist attacks world-wide have caused instability from time to time in global financial markets and the aviation industry. The long-term effects of terrorist attacks on us are unknown. These attacks and the U.S. government’s continued efforts against terrorist organizations may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the U.S. or elsewhere, which may further contribute to economic instability.Our business operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions or intrusions. We are dependent on various information technologies throughout our Company to administer, store and support multiple business activities. Disruptions or cyber security attacks such as unauthorized access, malicious software and other intrusions may lead to exposure of proprietary and confidential information as well as potential data corruption. Any intrusion may cause operational stoppages, diminished competitive advantages through reputational damages and increased operational costs.Our inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property or defend against assertions of infringement could prevent or restrict our ability to compete. We rely on patents, trademarks and proprietary knowledge and technology, both internally developed and acquired, in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Our inability to defend against the unauthorized use of these rights and assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against claims of infringement. This litigation could result in significant costs and divert our management’s focus away from operations.If we are unable to adapt to technological change, demand for our products may be reduced. The technologies related to our products have undergone, and in the future may undergo, significant changes. To succeed in the future, we will need to continue to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis. Our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we develop or that render our technology and products obsolete or uncompetitive. Furthermore, our products could become unmarketable if new industry standards emerge. We may have to modify our products significantly in the future to remain competitive, and new products we introduce may not be accepted by our customers.Our new product development efforts may not be successful, which would result in a reduction in our sales and earnings. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development of new products or product enhancements, and new products or product enhancements may not be accepted by our customers. In addition, the development expenses we incur may exceed our cost estimates, and new products we develop may not generate sales sufficient to offset our costs. If any of these events occur, our sales and profits could be adversely affected.We depend on government contracts and subcontracts with defense prime contractors and sub-contractors that may not be fully funded, may be terminated, or may be awarded to our competitors. The failure to be awarded these contracts, the failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales. Sales to the U.S. government and its prime contractors and subcontractors represent a significant portion of our business. The funding of these programs is generally subject to annual congressional appropriations, and congressional priorities are subject to change. In addition, government expenditures for defense programs may decline or these defense programs may be terminated. A decline in governmental expenditures or the termination of existing contracts may result in a reduction in the volume of contracts awarded to us. We have resources applied to specific government contracts and if any of those contracts were terminated, we may incur substantial costs redeploying those resources.If our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our prime contract performance and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted. Many of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor. Failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide, on a timely basis, the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations with our customer. Subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, a delay in our ability to obtain components and equipment 8Table of Contentsparts from our suppliers may affect our ability to meet our customers’ needs and may have an adverse effect upon our profitability.Our results of operations are affected by our fixed-price contracts, which could subject us to losses in the event that we have cost overruns. For the year ended December 31, 2015, fixed-price contracts represented almost all of the Company’s sales. On fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the scope of work specified in the contract for a predetermined price. Depending on the fixed price negotiated, these contacts may provide us with an opportunity to achieve higher profits based on the relationship between our costs and the contract’s fixed price. However, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit.Some of our contracts contain late delivery penalties. Failure to deliver in a timely manner due to supplier problems, development schedule slides, manufacturing difficulties, or similar schedule related events could have a material adverse effect on our business.The failure of our products may damage our reputation, necessitate a product recall or result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages. Defects in the design and manufacture of our products may necessitate a product recall. We include complex system design and components in our products that could contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products. If any of our products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. Such an event could result in significant expenses, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products. We are also exposed to product liability claims. We carry aircraft and non-aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms. However, this insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover the payment of any potential claim. A product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in discount rates and other estimates could affect our future earnings and equity. Our goodwill impairment evaluations are determined using valuations that involve several assumptions, including discount rates, cash flow estimates, growth rates and terminal values. Certain of these assumptions, particularly the discount rate, are based on market conditions and are outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity.Additionally, pension obligations and the related costs are determined using actual results and actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions. The most critical assumption is the discount rate. Other assumptions include mortality, salary increases and retirement age. The discount rate assumptions are based on current market conditions and are outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity. We are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks that could adversely affect our business, liquidity and operating results. Changes in the availability, terms and cost of capital, and increases in interest rates could cause our cost of doing business to increase and place us at a competitive disadvantage. At December 31, 2015, approximately 9% of our debt was at fixed interest rates with the remainder subject to variable interest rates.Contracting in the defense industry is subject to significant regulation, including rules related to bidding, billing and accounting kickbacks and false claims, and any non-compliance could subject us to fines and penalties or possible debarment. Like all government contractors, we are subject to risks associated with this contracting. These risks include the potential for substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in suspension or debarment from future government contracts.If we fail to meet expectations of securities analysts or investors due to fluctuations in our revenue or operating results, our stock price could decline significantly. Our revenue and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including delays or cancellations of programs. It is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. In this event, the trading price of our stock could decline significantly.Our operations in foreign countries expose us to political and currency risks and adverse changes in local legal and regulatory environments. In 2015, approximately 7.3% of our sales were made by our subsidiaries in France and Canada. Net assets held by these subsidiaries total $36.1 million at December 31, 2015. Our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies and by the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local 9Table of Contentscurrencies into U.S. dollars. We expect international operations and export sales to continue to contribute to our earnings for the foreseeable future. Both the sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside of the U.S. Such risks include the possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations, changes in tariff and trade barriers and import or export licensing requirements, and political or economic reprioritization, insurrection, civil disturbance or war.Government regulations could limit our ability to sell our products outside the U.S. and could otherwise adversely affect our business. Certain of our sales are subject to compliance with U.S. export regulations. Our failure to obtain, or fully adhere to the limitations contained in, the requisite licenses, meet registration standards or comply with other government export regulations would hinder our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products outside the U.S. Compliance with these government regulations may also subject us to additional fees and operating costs. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In order to sell our products in European Union countries, we must satisfy certain technical requirements. If we are unable to comply with those requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products, our sales in Europe would be restricted. Doing business internationally also subjects us to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, foreign corrupt practices and anti-boycott provisions. Our failure, or failure by an authorized agent or representative that is attributable to us, to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in monetary penalties, suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which would have a material adverse effect on us.Our stock price is volatile. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our stock price ranged from a low of $33.74 to a high of $66.61. The price of our common stock has been and likely will continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of events and factors, such as: •quarterly variations in operating results;•variances of our quarterly results of operations from securities analyst estimates;•changes in financial estimates;•announcements of technological innovations and new products; and•news reports relating to trends in our markets.In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for companies in the aerospace & defense industry in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies affected by these fluctuations.

As an aerospace company, we may become a party to litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including, among others, matters alleging product liability, warranty claims, breach of commercial or government contract or other legal actions. In general, litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to 10Table of Contentsbring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact results of operations and financial condition.We are a defendant in actions filed in the Regional State Court of Mannheim, Germany (Lufthansa Technik AG v. Astronics Advanced Electronics Systems Corp.) and the United States District for the Western District of Washington relating to an allegation of patent infringement. On December 29, 2010, Lufthansa Technik AG (“Lufthansa”) filed a Statement of Claim in the Regional State Court of Mannheim, Germany. Lufthansa’s claim asserts that our subsidiary, Astronics Advanced Electronic Systems Corp. (“AES”) sold, marketed and brought into use in Germany a power supply system which infringes upon a German patent held by Lufthansa. The relief sought by Lufthansa includes requiring AES to stop selling and marketing the allegedly infringing power supply system, a recall of allegedly infringing products sold to commercial customers since November 26, 2003 and compensation for damages. The claim does not specify an estimate of damages and a damages claim will be made by Lufthansa only if it receives a favorable ruling on the determination of infringement. The value of the dispute has been set by the court to be €2 million. This is an estimate of the commercial value of the matter.On February 6, 2015, the Regional State Court of Mannheim, Germany rendered its decision that the patent was infringed. The judgment does not require AES to recall products which are already installed in aircraft or have been sold to other end users. On July 15, 2015, Lufthansa advised AES of their intention to enforce the accounting provisions of the decision, which require AES to provide certain financial information regarding sales of the infringing product to enable Lufthansa to make an estimate of requested damages. Additionally, if Lufthansa provides the required bank guarantees specified in the decision, the Company may be required to offer a recall of products which are in the distribution channels in Germany, and provide certain financial information regarding sales of the infringing product to enable Lufthansa to make an estimate of requested damages. No such bank guarantees have been issued to date.The Company appealed and believes it has valid defenses to refute the decision.  The appeal process is estimated to extend up to two years.  The enforcement of the accounting provision of the decision, as discussed above, has no impact on the appeals process.  As a result, we do not currently have sufficient information to provide an estimate of AES’s potential exposure related to this matter.   As loss exposure is neither probable nor estimable at this time, the Company has not recorded any liability with respect to this litigation as of December 31, 2015.On November 26, 2014, Lufthansa filed a complaint in the United States District for the Western District of Washington. Lufthansa’s complaint in this action alleges that AES manufactures, uses, sells and offers for sale a power supply system which infringes upon a U.S. patent held by Lufthansa. The patent at issue in the U.S. action is based on technology similar to that involved in the German action. However, the U.S. court will not be bound by the ultimate determination made by the German court. The Company believes it has valid defenses to refute Lufthansa’s claims and intends to contest this matter vigorously. As this matter is in the early stages of fact discovery, we do not currently have sufficient information to provide an estimate of AES’s potential exposure related to this matter. As loss exposure is neither probable nor estimable at this time, the Company has not recorded any liability with respect to this litigation as of December 31, 2015"

Recently, the general economic and    capital market conditions in the United States and other    parts of the world have deteriorated significantly and have    adversely affected access to capital and increased the cost of    capital. If these conditions continue or become worse, our    future cost of debt and equity capital and access to capital    markets could be adversely affected. Any inability to obtain    adequate financing from debt and equity sources could force us    to self-fund strategic initiatives or even forgo some    opportunities, potentially harming our financial position,    results of operations and liquidity. The amount of debt we have outstanding, as well as any debt    we may incur in the future, could have an adverse effect on our    operational and financial flexibility. As of    December 31, 2008, we had $14.4 million of debt    outstanding, of which $13.5 million is long-term debt. Our    revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2008, totaled    $60.0 million and is made available through a group of    banks. On January 30, 2009, the Company amended this credit    facility by entering into an $85 million Amended and    Restated Credit Agreement dated as of January 30, 2009 with    a group of banks. The new Credit Agreement provides for a    five-year, $40 million senior secured term loan with    interest at LIBOR plus between 2.25% and 3.50% based on the    Companys leverage ratio, payable in quarterly installments    of $2.0 million. The Credit Agreement also provides for a    revolving credit line of $45 million, of which    approximately $30 million is currently available for    working capital requirements with interest at LIBOR plus between    2.25% and 3.50%. The credit facility allocates up to    $20 million of the $45 million revolving credit line    for the issuance of letters of credit, including certain    existing letters of credit totaling approximately    $15.0 million at December 31, 2008. The Companys    obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by a first    priority lien on virtually all the assets of the Company.     In addition, on January 30, 2009, The Company issued to the    former shareholders of DME a 6.0% subordinated promissory    note due 2014 in the aggregate principal amount of    $5 million. The Company also issued a    6.0% subordinated contingent promissory note due 2014 in    the aggregate principal amount of $2 million, which is due    only upon satisfaction of certain revenue performance criteria    for 2009.     Changes to our level of debt subsequent to December 31,    2008 could have significant consequences to our business,    including the following:           Depending on interest rates and debt maturities, a substantial    portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to    paying principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing    funds available for our acquisition strategy, capital    expenditures or other purposes;           A significant amount of debt could make us more vulnerable to    changes in economic conditions or increases in prevailing    interest rates;           Our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions,    capital expenditures or for other purposes could be impaired;           The increase in the amount of debt we have outstanding increases    the risk of non-compliance with some of the covenants in our    debt agreements which require us to maintain specified financial    ratios; and           We may be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may    result in a competitive disadvantage. The markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic    and foreign economic conditions and events, which may cause our    operating results to fluctuate. Demand by the business jet    markets for our products is dependent upon several factors,    including capital investment, product innovations, economic    growth, and technology upgrades. In addition, the commercial    airline industry is highly cyclical and sensitive to fuel price    increases, labor disputes and global economic conditions. A    change in any of these factors could result in a reduction in    the amount of air travel. A reduction in air travel would reduce    orders for new aircraft and reductions in cabin upgrades by    airlines for which we supply products and for the sales of spare    parts,    5Table of Contents    thus reducing our sales and profits. A reduction in air travel    may also result in our commercial airline customers being unable    to pay our invoices on a timely basis or not at all.     We are a supplier on various new aircraft programs just entering    or expected to begin production in the near future. As with any    new program there is risk as to whether the aircraft or program    will be successful and accepted by the market. As is customary    for our business we purchase inventory and invest in specific    capital equipment to support our production requirements    generally based on delivery schedules provided by our customer.    If a program or aircraft is not successful we may have to write    off all or a part of the inventory, accounts receivable and    capital equipment related to the program. A write off of these    assets could result in a significant reduction of earnings and    cause covenant violations relating to our debt agreements. This    could result in our being unable to borrow additional funds    under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance or    renegotiate the terms of our bond debt. Our products are sold in highly competitive markets. Some    of our competitors are larger; more diversified corporations and    have greater financial, marketing, production and research and    development resources. As a result, they may be better able to    withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns. Our    operations and financial performance will be negatively impacted    if our competitors:           Develop products that are superior to our products;           Develop products that are more competitively priced than our    products;           Develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing    products and services or           Adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving    customer requirements.     We believe that the principal points of competition in our    markets are product quality, price, design and engineering    capabilities, product development, conformity to customer    specifications, quality of support after the sale, timeliness of    delivery and effectiveness of the distribution organization.    Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require    continued investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality    standards, marketing, customer service and support and our    distribution networks. If we do not maintain sufficient    resources to make these investments, or are not successful in    maintaining our competitive position, our operations and    financial performance will suffer. The loss of Panasonic Avionics Corporation as a major    customer or a significant reduction in sales to Panasonic would    reduce our sales and earnings. In 2008 we had a    concentration of sales to Panasonic representing 24.9% of our    sales. The loss of this customer or a significant reduction in    sales to this customer would significantly reduce our sales and    earnings. Our future success depends to a significant degree upon the    continued contributions of our management team and technical    personnel. The loss of members of our management team could    have a material and adverse effect on our business. In addition,    competition for qualified technical personnel in our industries    is intense, and we believe that our future growth and success    will depend on our ability to attract, train and retain such    personnel. Future terror attacks, war, or other civil disturbances could    negatively impact our business. Continued terror attacks,    war or other disturbances could lead to further economic    instability and decreases in demand for our products, which    could negatively impact our business, financial condition and    results of operations. Terrorist attacks world-wide have caused    instability from time to time in global financial markets and    the aviation industry. The long-term effects of terrorist    attacks on us are unknown. These attacks and the    U.S. Governments continued efforts against terrorist    organizations may lead to additional armed hostilities or to    further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the United    States or elsewhere, which may further contribute to economic    instability. If we are unable to adapt to technological change, demand for    our products may be reduced. The technologies related to our    products have undergone, and in the future may undergo,    significant changes. To succeed in the future, we will need to    continue to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market    and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost    effective basis. Our competitors may develop    6Table of Contents    technologies and products that are more effective than those we    develop or that render our technology and products obsolete or    uncompetitive. Furthermore, our products could become    unmarketable if new industry standards emerge. We may have to    modify our products significantly in the future to remain    competitive, and new products we introduce may not be accepted    by our customers. Our new product development efforts may not be successful,    which would result in a reduction in our sales and earnings.    We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the    successful development of new products or product enhancements,    and new products or product enhancements may not be accepted by    our customers. In addition, the development expenses we incur    may exceed our cost estimates, and new products we develop may    not generate sales sufficient to offset our costs. If any of    these events occur, our sales and profits could be adversely    affected. If our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their    contractual obligations, our prime contract performance and our    ability to obtain future business could be materially and    adversely impacted. Many of our contracts involve    subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform    a portion of the services we must provide to our customers.    There is a risk that we may have disputes with our    subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and    timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or customer    concerns about the subcontractor. Failure by our subcontractors    to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the    agreed-upon    supplies or perform the    agreed-upon    services may materially and adversely impact our ability to    perform our obligations with our customer. Subcontractor    performance deficiencies could result in a customer terminating    our contract for default. A default termination could expose us    to liability and substantially impair our ability to compete for    future contracts and orders. In addition, a delay in our ability    to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may    affect our ability to meet our customers needs and may    have an adverse effect upon our profitability. Our results of operations are affected by our fixed-price    contracts, which could subject us to losses in the event that we    have cost overruns. For the year ended December 31,    2008, fixed-price contracts represented 100% of our sales. On    fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the scope of work    specified in the contract for a predetermined price. Depending    on the fixed price negotiated, these contacts may provide us    with an opportunity to achieve higher profits based on the    relationship between our costs and the contracts fixed    price. However, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected    costs may reduce our profit. Some of our contracts contain late delivery penalties.    Failure to deliver in a timely manner due to supplier problems,    development schedule slides, manufacturing difficulties, or    similar schedule related events could have a material adverse    effect on our business. The failure of our products may damage our reputation,    necessitate a product recall or result in claims against us that    exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay    significant damages. Defects in the design and manufacture    of our products may necessitate a product recall. We include    complex system design and components in our products that could    contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new    technology into our products. If any of our products are    defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those    products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. Such an    event could result in significant expenses, disrupt sales and    affect our reputation and that of our products. We are also    exposed to product liability claims. We carry aircraft and    non-aircraft product liability insurance consistent with    industry norms. However, this insurance coverage may not be    sufficient to fully cover the payment of any potential claim. A    product recall or a product liability claim not covered by    insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business,    financial condition and results of operations. Our facilities could be damaged by catastrophes which could    reduce our production capacity and result in a loss of    customers. We conduct our operations in facilities located    in the United States and Canada. Any of these facilities could    be damaged by fire, floods, earthquakes, power loss,    telecommunication and information systems failure or similar    events. Although we carry property insurance, including business    interruption insurance, our inability to meet customers    schedules as a result of catastrophe may result in a loss of    customers or significant additional costs such as penalty claims    under customer contracts.    7Table of ContentsContracting in the defense industry is subject to significant    regulation, including rules related to bidding, billing and    accounting kickbacks and false claims, and any non-compliance    could subject us to fines and penalties or possible debarment.    Like all government contractors, we are subject to risks    associated with this contracting. These risks include the    potential for substantial civil and criminal fines and    penalties. These fines and penalties could be imposed for    failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules,    employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to    follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks    or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to    be, subjected to audits and investigations by government    agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government    contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also    result in suspension or debarment from future government    contracts. Changes in discount rates and other factors could affect our    future earnings and equity. Pension obligations and the    related costs are determined using actual results and actuarial    valuations that involve several assumptions. The most critical    assumption is the discount rate. Other assumptions include    salary increases and retirement age. The discount rate    assumptions are based on current market conditions and are    outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could    affect our future earnings and equity. We are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks    that could adversely affect our business, liquidity and    operating results. Changes in the availability, terms and    cost of capital, increases in interest rates or a reduction in    credit rating could cause our cost of doing business to increase    and place us at a competitive disadvantage. At December 31,    2008, 23% of our debt was at fixed interest rates with the    remaining 77% subject to variable interest rates.     On January 30, 2009, in conjunction with an acquisition of    DME, the Company entered into a new credit facility, causing 83%    of our debt to be variable and 17% of our debt to be fixed. In    addition, our new debt financing contains various financial    covenants. If our financial performance differs from our    expectation we may violate one or more of those covenants. A    covenant violation would require a waiver by the lenders or an    alternative financing arrangement be achieved. Historically both    choices have been available to us however in the current credit    market environment it is difficult to predict the availability    of these options in the future. We are subject to the risk of loss resulting from our    customers defaulting on their obligations to us. The    inability of our customers to pay us due to adverse economic    conditions or their inability to access available credit could    have an adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. Our international operations pose currency and other risks    that may adversely impact sales and earnings. We have    manufacturing and sales operations in foreign countries. In    addition, our domestic operations have sales to foreign    customers. Our financial results may be adversely affected by    fluctuations in foreign currencies and by the translation of the    financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local    currencies into U.S. dollars. The translation of our sales    in foreign currencies, which are primarily the Canadian Dollar    to the U.S. dollar had an insignificant impact on both    sales for 2008 using average exchange rates for 2008 compared to    average exchange rates for 2007 and on sales for 2007 using    average exchange rates for 2007 compared to average exchange    rates for 2006. We depend on government contracts and subcontracts with    defense prime contractors and sub contractors that may not be    fully funded, may be terminated, or may be awarded to our    competitors . The failure to be awarded these contracts or    failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of    these contracts could reduce our sales. Sales to the    U.S. Government and its prime contractors and    subcontractors represent a significant portion of our business.    The funding of these programs is generally subject to annual    congressional appropriations, and congressional priorities are    subject to change. In addition, government expenditures for    defense programs may decline or these defense programs may be    terminated. A decline in governmental expenditures may result in    a reduction in the volume of contracts awarded to us. Government regulations could limit our ability to sell our    products outside the United States and otherwise adversely    affect our business. Our failure to obtain the requisite    licenses, meet registration standards or comply with other    government export regulations would hinder our ability to    generate revenues from the sale of our products outside the    United States. Compliance with these government regulations may    8Table of Contents    also subject us to additional fees and operating costs. The    absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other    countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In    order to sell our products in European Union countries, we must    satisfy certain technical requirements. If we are unable to    comply with those requirements with respect to a significant    quantity of our products, our sales in Europe would be    restricted. Doing business internationally also subjects us to    numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including,    without limitation, regulations relating to import-export    control, technology transfer restrictions, foreign corrupt    practices and anti-boycott provisions. Failure by us or our    sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws    and regulations could result in administrative, civil or    criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in    suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension    of our export privileges, which would have a material adverse    effect on us. If we fail to meet expectations of securities analysts or    investors due to fluctuations in our revenue or operating    results, our stock price could decline significantly. Our    revenue and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due    to a number of factors, including delays or cancellations of    programs. It is likely that in some future quarters our    operating results may fall below the expectations of securities    analysts or investors. In this event, the trading price of our    stock could decline significantly. Our sales and earnings may be reduced if we cannot    successfully integrate DMEs business. If we are unable    to successfully integrate DMEs businesses subsequent to    the acquisition on January 30, 2009, into our existing    operations or if DMEs business is unsuccessful in winning    new government programs, our sales and earnings could be    impacted"
