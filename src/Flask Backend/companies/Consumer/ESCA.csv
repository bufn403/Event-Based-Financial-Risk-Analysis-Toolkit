1,ESCA,ESCALADE INC,2024-03-29,"ITEM 1A—RISK FACTORS OPERATIONAL RISKS TO THE COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS  Markets are highly competitive which could limit the Company’s growth and reduce profitability. The market for sporting goods is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. A majority of the Company’s products are in markets that are experiencing low growth rates. Escalade competes with a variety of regional, national and international manufacturers for customers, employees, products, services and other important aspects of the business. The Company has historically sold a large percentage of its sporting goods products to mass merchandisers and has increasingly attempted to expand sales to specialty retailer and dealer markets and to on-line retailers. In addition to competition for sales into those distribution channels, vendors also must compete in sporting goods with large format sporting goods stores, traditional sporting goods stores and chains, warehouse clubs, discount stores and department stores. Competition from on-line retailers may also impact sales. Some of the current and potential competitors are larger than Escalade and have substantially greater financial resources that may be devoted to sourcing, promoting and selling their products, and may discount prices more heavily than the Company can afford. If the Company is unable to predict or effectively react to changes in consumer demand, it may lose customers and sales may decline. Success depends in part on the ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand and preferences regarding sporting goods. Products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. The Company often makes commitments to manufacture products months in advance of the proposed delivery to customers. If Escalade misjudges the market for products, sales may decline significantly. The Company may have to take significant inventory markdowns on unpopular products that are overproduced and/or miss opportunities for other products that may rise in popularity, both of which could have a negative impact on profitability. A major shift in consumer demand away from sporting goods products could also have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s operating results have been adversely impacted by higher inventory levels.  In response to supply chain issues and other factors, the Company accelerated its product purchases to meet expected demand. Although the Company endeavors to accurately predict changes in customer demands and consumer spending patterns with respect to the Company’s products, demand for products can change significantly between the time inventory is ordered and the date of sale. While the Company continues to experience product demand in excess of pre-COVID-19 levels, the Company’s inventories at the beginning of 2023 were higher than desired. During 2023, the Company successfully reduced inventory to more normalized levels across most of its categories. The reduction in inventories and increased costs associated with the higher inventory levels, adversely impacted the Company’s operating results in 2023. 7  The Company may pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures, or investments and the failure of a strategic transaction to produce anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate an acquired company could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business. The Company has made acquisitions of complementary companies or businesses, which have been part of the strategic plan, and may continue to pursue acquisitions in the future from time to time. Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, and may result in the diversion of capital and management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities. The Company may not be able to successfully integrate operations that it acquires, including personnel, financial and information systems, cybersecurity measures, distribution, and operating procedures. If the Company fails to successfully integrate acquisitions, the Company’s business could suffer. In addition, acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expense or write-offs of goodwill or other intangibles, any of which could affect the Company’s financial position. The Company also has sometimes divested or discontinued certain operations, assets, and products that did not perform to the Company’s expectations or no longer fit with the Company’s strategic objectives. Divestitures may result in gains, losses, contingent liabilities, write-offs, tax consequences, or other related costs and expenses that could affect the Company’s financial position. Escalade will consider acquisitions, divestitures, and investments in the future, one or more of which, individually or in the aggregate, could be material to the Company’s overall business, operations or financial position. Growth may strain resources, which could adversely affect the Company’s business and financial performance. The Company has grown in the past through strategic acquisitions, and continues to make acquisitions in its Sporting Goods business. Our growth strategy also depends on our ability to grow our e-commerce business, including continued expansion and development of our own direct to consumer e-commerce distribution channel. Growth places additional demands on management and operational systems. If the Company is not successful in continuing to support operational and financial systems, expanding the management team and increasing and effectively managing customers and suppliers, growth may result in operational inefficiencies and ineffective management of the Company’s business, which could adversely affect its business and financial performance. The Company’s ability to operate and expand its business and to respond to changing business and economic conditions will be dependent upon the availability of adequate capital. The rate of expansion will also depend on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn will depend in large part on cash flow generated by the business and the availability of equity and debt capital. The Company can make no assurances that it will be able to obtain equity or debt capital on acceptable terms or at all. Our current senior secured revolving credit facility contains provisions that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or make substantial asset sales, which might otherwise be used to finance our operations. In the event of our insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, the lenders under our senior secured revolving credit facility would be entitled to payment in full from our assets before distributions, if any, to our stockholders. The Company could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled management and key personnel. The Company’s success depends in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified management executives and key personnel. Significant competition for qualified candidates exists in the Company’s business lines and geographic locations. If the Company is not able to hire and retain its executives and key personnel, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain such individuals becomes more expensive, the Company may suffer adverse consequences to its business, operations, and financial condition. 8  The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a few significant customers and loss of any of these customers could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. The Company has two major customers, each of which accounted for more than ten percent of consolidated gross sales in the Company’s 2023 fiscal year. The Company also has several other large customers, none of which represent more than ten percent of consolidated gross sales, and historically has derived substantial revenues from these customers. Our customers continue to experience industry consolidation, which increases our risk that we may be unable to find sufficient alternative customers. The Company needs to continue to expand its customer base, including sales of new product offerings to existing customers, in order to minimize the effects of the loss of any single customer in the future. If sales to one or more of the large customers would be lost or materially reduced, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to replace such revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s customers may experience financial difficulties that could result in losses to the Company. From time to time, one or more of the Company’s customers have experienced, are experiencing, or may in the future experience financial difficulties that impair their ability to pay all amounts owed to the Company. In such instances, the customer may file bankruptcy or take other actions to restructure the amounts owed to secured and unsecured creditors, including unsecured trade creditors such as the Company. When this occurs, the Company may not be able to collect the full amount owed to it by the customer, and in severe situations may have to write off all or a substantial portion of those customer receivables. Any significant resulting losses incurred by the Company relating to these or other customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operation, and financial condition. The Company’s business may be adversely affected by the actions of and risks associated with third-party suppliers. The raw materials that the Company purchases for manufacturing operations and many of the products that it sells are sourced from a wide variety of third-party suppliers. The Company cannot control the supply, design, function or cost of many of the products that are offered for sale and are dependent on the availability and pricing of key materials and products. Disruptions in the availability of raw materials used in production of these products may adversely affect sales and result in customer dissatisfaction. The ability to find qualified suppliers and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced outside the United States. Political instability, financial instability of suppliers, merchandise quality issues, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, inflation and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond the Company’s control. Historically, instability in the political and economic environments of the countries in which the Company or its suppliers obtain products and raw materials has not had a material adverse effect on operations. However, the Company cannot predict the effect that future changes in economic or political conditions in the United States and in such foreign countries may have on operations. In the event of disruptions or delays in supply due to economic or political conditions, such disruptions or delays could adversely affect results of operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements could be made. In addition, products and materials purchased from alternative sources may be of lesser quality or more expensive than the products and materials currently purchased abroad. 9  Deterioration in relationships with suppliers or in the financial condition of suppliers could adversely affect liquidity, results of operations and financial position. Access to materials, parts and supplies is dependent upon close relationships with suppliers and the ability to purchase products from the principal suppliers on competitive terms. The Company does not enter into long-term supply contracts with these suppliers, and has no current plans to do so in the future. These suppliers are not required to sell to the Company and are free to change the prices and other terms. Any deterioration or change in the relationships with or in the financial condition of the Company’s significant suppliers could have an adverse impact on its ability to procure materials and parts necessary to produce products for sale and distribution. If the Company or any of the significant suppliers terminated or significantly curtailed its relationship with a significant supplier or the Company, respectively, or if a significant supplier ceased operations, the Company would be forced to expand relationships with other suppliers, seek out new relationships with new suppliers or risk a loss in market share due to diminished product offerings and availability. Any change in one or more of these suppliers’ willingness or ability to continue to supply the Company with their products could have an adverse impact on the Company’s liquidity, results of operations and financial position. Disruptions to our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our operations. Many of the Company’s products are manufactured outside the United States. Those products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products could occur due to work stoppages, port strikes, lack of availability of transportation, and other factors beyond the Company’s control. The Company continues to experience increased shipping costs for products obtained from overseas due to a shortage of available shipping containers. If the Company experiences any significant disruption in its supply chain or sharply rising costs, for any reason, such as the coronavirus pandemic, the Company may be unable to satisfy customer demand for our products resulting in lost sales. Such delays and increased costs could impair our ability to timely and efficiently deliver our products, and could adversely impact our operating results. Intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of products. The Company obtains patents, trademarks and copyrights for intellectual property, including its brand names, which represent important assets to the Company. If the Company fails to adequately protect intellectual property through patents, trademarks and copyrights, its intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others, invalidated or challenged, and our competitors could duplicate the Company’s products or may otherwise limit any competitive design or manufacturing advantages. The Company believes that success is likely to depend upon continued innovation, technical expertise, marketing skills, branding, customer support and services rather than on legal protection of intellectual property rights. However, the Company intends to aggressively assert its intellectual property rights when necessary. The expiration or termination of our material trademarks, brand names and licensing agreements could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company has invested substantial resources in developing and marketing the Company’s brands and products over many years. The expiration or termination of one or more of the Company’s material trademarks, patents or licensing agreements could result in the loss of such intellectual property. In such event, the Company may not be able to recoup its investments in, and continue to benefit from the affected brand names or products. The loss of such intellectual property and related rights could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 10  Breaches of data or technology security could damage the Company’s reputation, cause the Company to incur additional expense, expose the Company to litigation, and adversely affect the Company’s business.  A breach of our data or technology security could result in an unauthorized transfer or release of Company proprietary, employee, customer and other Company related information, or the loss of valuable business data or technology, that could cause a disruption in our business. Hackers are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex cyber security attacks. In the event of such an attack, we may expend significant capital and other resources to protect against, respond to, and/or alleviate problems caused by a breach. Such an event could also result in unwanted negative media attention, damage to the Company’s reputation, damage to our customers, and result in lost sales and lawsuits. The Company also must comply with increasingly complex regulatory cyber security and privacy standards, which can be costly and negatively impact the Company’s profitability. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information could harm the Company’s business and its standing with its customers. Through sales and marketing activities, the Company collects and stores certain information that customers provide to purchase products or services or otherwise communicate and interact with the Company. Despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, the Company cannot be certain that all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate the Company’s network security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer or business information. In addition, an employee, a contractor or other third party with whom the Company does business may attempt to circumvent the Company’s security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Loss of customer or business information could disrupt operations, damage the Company’s reputation, and expose the Company to claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. Cybersecurity breaches or other data security incidents could result in unauthorized access, theft, modification, or destruction of Company assets, including bank accounts, intellectual property, and confidential information, which may adversely affect the Company’s business.  The Company has experienced an increase in cybersecurity threats and attempts to breach the Company’s security networks. The techniques used to conduct cyber-attacks, including phishing, hacking, and malicious software, are increasingly sophisticated and the sources and targets of these attacks change frequently. Cyber-attacks may not be recognized until after attacks have been launched successfully or have been in place for a period of time. The Company has been, is currently, and likely will continue to be, the target of cyber and other security threats. To the Company’s knowledge, the Company has not experienced a significant cybersecurity breach that had a material impact on the Company’s business or operating results, although there can be no assurance that the Company’s efforts to maintain the security of the Company’s information technology networks and related systems will be effective or that attempted security breaches will not be damaging in the future. The Company maintains cyber liability insurance, however, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that could result from a breach of the Company’s systems. 11  The Company’s business involves the potential for product recalls, warranty liability, product liability, and other claims against us, which could adversely affect our reputation, earnings and financial condition. As a manufacturer, marketer and distributor of consumer products, the Company is subject to the United States Consumer Products Safety Act of 1972, as amended by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, which empowers the Consumer Products Safety Commission (“CPSC”) to recall or exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous. Although recalls of our products have been infrequent, the Company’s subsidiaries voluntarily recalled the Ping Pong Avenger table tennis table in 2021 due to concerns that it could create a potential fall risk to consumers and certain Goalsetter wall-mounted basketball goals in 2022 that could detach and fall to the ground unexpectedly if not installed correctly. Our sales of such wall-mounted basketball goals have been adversely impacted as well. Notwithstanding that we extensively and rigorously test our products, there can be no assurance we will be able to detect, prevent, or fix all defects and safety concerns. Under certain circumstances, the CPSC could require us to repurchase or recall additional products, even if we disagree with the defect determination or have data that shows the actual safety risk to be nominal. Any repurchase or recall of our products, monetary judgment, fine or other penalty could be costly and damaging to our reputation and/or adversely affect our brands. Furthermore, the occurrence of any material defects in our products could expose us to liability for warranty claims in excess of our current reserves, and/or to product liability claims that could exceed the limits of our insurance coverage, to the extent coverage may exist. If our warranty reserves and/or insurance coverage are inadequate to cover future warranty claims and/or potential product liability claims, our financial condition and operating results may be harmed. The Company may be subject to various types of litigation, and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages related to those claims. From time-to-time the Company may be involved in lawsuits or other claims arising in the ordinary course of business, including those related to product liability, consumer protection, employment, intellectual property, tort, privacy and data protection, and other matters. The Company may incur losses relating to claims filed against it, including costs associated with defending against such claims, and there is risk that any such claims or liabilities will exceed its insurance coverage, or affect the Company’s ability to retain adequate liability insurance in the future. Even if a claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any such assertions could adversely affect the Company’s reputation. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and other claims, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such matters. Unseasonable or extreme weather conditions, alone or together with natural disasters, as well as other catastrophic events, could adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations. Unseasonable or extreme weather conditions, natural disasters and other catastrophic events could negatively impact consumer shopping patterns, consumer confidence and disposable income, or otherwise could have a negative effect on the company’s financial performance. The Company’s business is susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions, particularly as it relates to sports equipment and recreational outdoor products, which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could reduce demand for a portion of the Company’s inventory and thereby reduce sales and profitability. In addition, extreme weather conditions, natural disasters and other catastrophic events could damage or destroy our facilities, cause staffing shortages or make it difficult for customers to travel to stores and dealers where the Company’s products are sold. Such events and circumstances could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations from time to time. 12  The market price of the Company’s common stock is likely to be highly volatile as the stock market in general can be highly volatile. The public trading of the Company’s common stock is based on many factors which could cause fluctuation in the Company’s stock price. These factors may include, among other things:  ●General economic and market conditions; ●Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results; ●Limited research coverage by securities analysts; ●Relatively low market capitalization resulting in low trading volume in the Company’s stock; ●If securities analysts provide coverage, our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts' estimates or expectations; ●Conditions or trends in the Company’s industries; ●Changes in the market valuations of other companies in the Company’s industries; ●Announcements by the Company or the Company’s competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives; ●Capital commitments; ●Additions or departures of key personnel; ●Tariffs, quotas, customs, import and export restrictions, and other trade barriers; ●Global events, including acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, political instability, natural disasters, and public health crises (such as the COVID 19 pandemic); ●Sales and repurchases of the Company’s common stock; and ●The ability to maintain listing of the Company’s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market and/or inclusion in market indices such as the Russell 2000. Many of these factors are beyond the Company’s control. These factors may cause the market price of the Company’s common stock to decline, regardless of operating performance. If we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.  Our quarterly cash dividend is currently $0.15 per common share. The dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. Our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our Board of Directors (Board) may, at its discretion, increase or decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price. RISKS OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS  International operations expose the Company to the unique risks inherent in foreign operations. The Company sources many of its products and raw materials from Mexico, Brazil, China, Vietnam and other Asian countries. Foreign operations encounter risks similar to those faced by U.S. operations, as well as risks inherent in foreign operations, such as local customs and regulatory constraints, control over product quality and content, foreign trade policies, competitive conditions, foreign currency fluctuations and unstable political and economic conditions. Additionally, our international operations may be adversely affected by political events, domestic or international terrorist events and hostilities, complications due to natural, nuclear or other disasters, or public health crises. These types of events, developments and/or health concerns in locations in which the Company conducts business could result in social, economic and labor instability. Such uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of the Company’s operations and on the Company’s income and profitability. 13  The Company’s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing outside of the United States, and risks arising from tariffs and/or international trade wars. The Company imports many of its raw materials and finished goods from countries outside of the United States, including but not limited to China, Brazil, Vietnam and Mexico. The Company’s ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may be affected by conditions, such as public health crises, labor disputes, political unrest, and security requirements of the U.S. and other countries that could delay importation of products or require us to locate alternative sources. Our import operations are subject to complex custom laws, regulations, tax requirements, and trade regulations, such as tariffs set by governments through mutual agreements or bilateral actions. U.S. tariffs on goods imported into the U.S., particularly goods from China, have increased the cost of goods purchased by the Company and the ongoing adverse effects of such tariffs potentially could become even more severe. The overall effect of these risks is that our costs may increase, which in turn may result in lower profitability if we are unable to offset such increases through higher prices, and/or that we may suffer a decline in sales if our customers do not accept price increases. The United States, Mexico and Canada have entered into the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (""USMCA""), the successor agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (""NAFTA"") which became effective on July 1, 2020. In January 2020, the United States entered into a ""Phase 1"" trade agreement with China. The Phase 1 agreement expired December 31, 2021 and has not been extended or replaced. Trade negotiations between the United States and China regarding a potential new trade agreement have not progressed and prospects for a new agreement are highly uncertain. Accordingly, it remains unclear what the U.S. administration or foreign governments, including China, specifically will or will not do with respect to tariffs, the USMCA or other international trade agreements and policies. A trade war, other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements, changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently manufacture and sell products or any resulting negative sentiments towards the United States could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Substantially all of our import operations are subject to customs and tax requirements as well as trade regulations, such as tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements or bilateral actions. In addition, the countries in which our products are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions. Adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions, or our suppliers' failure to comply with customs regulations or similar laws, could harm our business. In this regard, possible changes in U.S. policies and the potential effects of foreign laws and policies create significant uncertainty with respect to future tax and trade regulations. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions on imported merchandise or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations that impose requirements that could adversely affect our business, such as setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country. The Company could be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates and/or the value of the United States dollar. The Company is exposed to risks related to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the value of the United States dollar. Changes in currency exchange rates and the value of the United States dollar can have a significant impact on earnings. While the Company carefully watches fluctuations in currency exchange rates, these types of changes can have material adverse effects on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. 14  LEGAL, TAX, ACCOUNTING AND REGULATORY RISKS The Company has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. Failure to remediate, improve and maintain the quality of internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in the Company’s financial statements and could materially and adversely affect the Company’s ability to provide timely and accurate financial information about the Company, which could harm the Company’s reputation and share price.  Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, the Company’s management is required to report on, and the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to, the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess the Company’s internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. Annually, the Company’s management performs activities that include reviewing, documenting and testing the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. In addition, if the Company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal control over financial reporting, the Company’s management will not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that the Company maintains effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, management, with the assistance of its independent registered public accounting firm,  identified deficiencies in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management then concluded, with the oversight of the Company’s Audit Committee, that such deficiencies represent material weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting even though these material weaknesses did not result in any material errors or any restatement of the Company’s previously reported financial results. For further discussion of these material weaknesses, see “Item 9A, Controls and Procedures.” A “material weakness” is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management cannot be certain that other deficiencies or material weaknesses will not arise or be identified or that the Company will be able to correct and maintain adequate controls over financial processes and reporting in the future. Management and the Company’s Audit Committee are committed to achieving and maintaining a strong internal control environment and are currently evaluating remediation efforts that will be designed and implemented to enhance the Company’s control environment. The identified material weaknesses in internal control and procedures will only be considered remediated when the relevant controls have operated effectively for a sufficient period of time for management to conclude that they have been remediated. The Company believes that it will be successful in remediating the material weaknesses identified by management, although there can be no assurances in this regard. In addition, in the future, the Company may be unable to identify and remediate additional control deficiencies, including material weaknesses. If not successfully remediated, the Company’s failure to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in, or restatements of, the Company’s financial statements, could cause the Company to fail to meet its reporting obligations and/or could cause investors to lose confidence in the Company’s reported financial information, which could adversely affect the trading price of the Company’s common stock and harm the Company’s reputation. In addition, such failures could result in violations of applicable securities laws, an inability to meet NASDAQ listing requirements, a default in covenants under the Company’s credit facilities, and/or exposure to lawsuits, investigations or other legal proceedings. 15  The Company is subject to risks associated with laws and regulations related to health, safety and environmental protection. Products, and the production and distribution of products, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmental protection. Laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmental protection have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates in the United States and abroad. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. New laws, policies, regulations, rulemaking and oversight, as well as changes to those currently in effect, could adversely impact our earnings, cash flows and operations. Our assets and operations are subject to regulation and oversight by federal, state, and local regulatory authorities. Legislative changes, as well as regulatory actions taken by these agencies, have the potential to adversely affect our profitability. In addition, a certain degree of regulatory uncertainty is created by the U.S. political climate. It remains unclear specifically what the current presidential administration, Congress and the courts may do with respect to future policies, regulations and legal decisions that may affect us. Regulation affects many aspects of our business and extends to such matters as (i) federal, state, and local taxation; (ii) rates (which include tax, commodity, surcharges and fuel); (iii) the integrity, safety and security of facilities and operations; (iv) environmental, social and governance issues that could impact the way we conduct our business; (v) the acquisition of other businesses; (vi) the acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of services or facilities; (vii) reporting and information requirements; and (viii) the maintenance of accounts and records. The preparation of the Company’s financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make significant estimates that may affect financial statements. Due to the inherent nature of making estimates, actual results may vary substantially from such estimates, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For more information on the Company’s critical accounting estimates, please see the Critical Accounting Estimates section of this Form 10-K. Changes in accounting standards could impact reported earnings and financial condition. The accounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and apply and can materially affect how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, which may result in the restatement of prior period financial statements. 16  MACROECONOMIC AND GENERAL BUSINESS RISKS Operating results may be impacted by changes in the economy that influence business and consumer spending. Operating results are directly impacted by the health of the North American and to a lesser extent, European and Asian economies. We cannot predict how robust the economy will be or whether or not it will be sustained. If economic recovery is slow to occur, or if the economy experiences a prolonged period of decelerating or negative growth, the Company’s results of operations may be negatively impacted. In general, the Company’s sales depend on discretionary spending by consumers. Business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions, including unemployment levels, energy costs, interest rates, recession, inflation, the impact of natural disasters and terrorist activities, public health crisis, and other matters that influence business and consumer spending. Fluctuation in economic conditions could prevent the Company from accurately forecasting demand for its products which could adversely affect its operating results or market share. Fluctuation in economic conditions and market instability in the United States and globally makes it difficult for the Company, customers and suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause the Company to produce and/or purchase excess products that can increase inventory carrying costs and result in obsolete inventory. Alternatively, this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortage of products, or materials used in products, that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for products and a loss of market share. Failure to sustain a continuing economic recovery in the United States and elsewhere could have a substantial adverse effect on our business. Our business is tied to general economic and industry conditions as demand for sporting goods depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumer confidence levels and the availability and cost of credit. These factors have had and could continue to have a substantial impact on our business. Adverse global economic conditions could also cause our customers and suppliers to experience severe economic constraints in the future, including bankruptcy, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. 17  Quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation. Operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, and the Company expects they will continue to do so in the future. Factors that could cause these quarterly fluctuations include the following: international, national and local general economic and market conditions; the size and growth of the overall sporting goods markets; intense competition among manufacturers, marketers, distributors and sellers of products; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of products and sports; seasonal demand for products; adverse weather conditions that may create fluctuations in demand for certain of our products; the size, timing and mix of purchases of products; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; ability to sustain, manage or forecast growth and inventories; new product development and introduction; ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; performance and reliability of products; customer service; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors; business disruptions; disruptions or delays in our supply chain, including potential disruptions or delays arising from political unrest, war, labor strikes, natural disasters, and public heath crises such as the coronavirus pandemic; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without limitation: exchange rates, import duties, tariffs, quotas and political and economic instability; changes in government regulations; any liability and other claims asserted against the Company; ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and any other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company’s operating results during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be indicative of operating results going forward. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in fiscal years 2020, 2021 and 2022, demand for the Company’s products increased substantially compared to pre-pandemic sales. While the Company’s financial results exceeded historical levels in many respects, such gains were offset to some degree by the adverse effects of the pandemic on the Company in other areas, such as higher supply chain costs and inventory levels, and by the adverse impacts on many of the Company’s customers and suppliers. Consumer demand for the Company’s products decreased in 2023, but remained above pre-COVID-19 levels and market share has increased in several key categories. As a result of these pandemic related factors, the comparability of year-over-year and quarterly performance going forward may not be indicative of future performance. The ultimate extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company remains uncertain and will depend on future developments. Terrorist attacks, acts of war, natural disasters, and public health crises may seriously harm the Company’s business. Among the chief uncertainties facing the nation and the world and, as a result, our business, is the instability and conflicts in the Middle East and in Ukraine and uncertainties regarding North Korea, Russia, China and other Asian and European countries. Obviously, no one can predict with certainty what the overall economic impact will be as a result of these circumstances. Terrorist attacks may cause damage or disruption to the Company, employees, facilities and customers, which could significantly impact net sales, costs and expenses and financial condition. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and international responses to terrorist attacks, and other acts of war and hostility may cause greater uncertainty and cause business to suffer in ways the Company currently cannot predict. In addition, any natural disaster or other serious disruption to one of the Company’s manufacturing or distribution sites due to fire, tornado, earthquake or other natural disasters in countries where the Company conducts business, or political unrest, war, labor strikes, work stoppages or public health crises, such as outbreaks of the coronavirus in countries where our suppliers are located could result in the disruption of the Company’s shipments and supply chain of products and raw materials. Although we obtained product shipments from China and other countries during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic, product shipments from China and/or other countries may be delayed in the future. Any significant disruption of the Company’s supply chain, manufacturing operations, and/or product shipments resulting from similar events on a large scale or over a prolonged period could cause significant delays until the Company would be able to resume normal operations or shift to other third party suppliers, if needed. There can be no assurance that alternative capacity could be obtained on favorable terms, if at all, and could negatively affect the Company’s sales and profitability. 18  The occurrence of future pandemics or similar events and their ultimate magnitude is unpredictable, volatile and uncertain.  The COVID-19 pandemic created significant public health concerns and economic disruption, which materially impacted the Company, our customers, suppliers and sales channels. We cannot predict whether the coronavirus will resurface or whether future pandemics or other public health crises will emerge. Nor can we predict the impact of such occurrences nor whether and to what degree any disruptions might be caused thereby. In such events, many indeterminable factors may arise, including the duration and severity of the occurrence, the amount of time it may take for more normalized economic activity to resume, future government actions that may be taken, the effects on the Company’s customers and suppliers, including their ability to pay for our products, the effects on operations of the Company’s logistics providers, and the impact on the ability of the Company’s employees to work and travel. Governmental actions may cause the Company to modify its business operations or otherwise adversely impact the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to respond quickly enough or appropriately to circumstances that may change rapidly and/or that are outside of our control. The short-term and long-term impacts of such occurrences on the Company’s business is unknown and ultimately could result in material adverse effects on the Company’s business, financial performance and results of operations. These risks are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Form 10-K may include additional factors which could adversely impact the Company’s business and financial performance. Moreover, the Company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors, nor can the Company assess the impact of all factors on business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. "
3,ESCA,ESCALADE INC,2023-02-24,"ITEM 1A—RISK FACTORS OPERATIONAL RISKS TO THE COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS  Markets are highly competitive which could limit the Company’s growth and reduce profitability. The market for sporting goods is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. A majority of the Company’s products are in markets that are experiencing low growth rates. Escalade competes with a variety of regional, national and international manufacturers for customers, employees, products, services and other important aspects of the business. The Company has historically sold a large percentage of its sporting goods products to mass merchandisers and has increasingly attempted to expand sales to specialty retailer and dealer markets and to on-line retailers. In addition to competition for sales into those distribution channels, vendors also must compete in sporting goods with large format sporting goods stores, traditional sporting goods stores and chains, warehouse clubs, discount stores and department stores. Competition from on-line retailers may also impact sales. Some of the current and potential competitors are larger than Escalade and have substantially greater financial resources that may be devoted to sourcing, promoting and selling their products, and may discount prices more heavily than the Company can afford. If the Company is unable to predict or effectively react to changes in consumer demand, it may lose customers and sales may decline. Success depends in part on the ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand and preferences regarding sporting goods. Products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. The Company often makes commitments to manufacture products months in advance of the proposed delivery to customers. If Escalade misjudges the market for products, sales may decline significantly. The Company may have to take significant inventory markdowns on unpopular products that are overproduced and/or miss opportunities for other products that may rise in popularity, both of which could have a negative impact on profitability. A major shift in consumer demand away from sporting goods products could also have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. 7  The Company has been experiencing higher inventory levels, which adversely impacts the Company’s operating results.  In response to supply chain issues and other factors, the Company accelerated its product purchases to meet expected demand. Although the Company endeavors to accurately predict changes in customer demands and consumer spending patterns with respect to the Company’s products, demand for products can change significantly between the time inventory is ordered and the date of sale. While the Company continues to experience product demand in excess of historical levels, the Company’s inventories throughout 2022 were  higher than desired. In some instances, product was received after the peak sales season had occurred, thereby further contributing to above normal inventory levels. Accordingly, increased costs associated with inventory adversely impacted the Company’s operating results in 2022 and may continue to do so until inventories are optimized. The Company may pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures, or investments and the failure of a strategic transaction to produce anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate an acquired company could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business. The Company has made acquisitions of complementary companies or businesses, which have been part of the strategic plan, and may continue to pursue acquisitions in the future from time to time. Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, and may result in the diversion of capital and management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities. The Company may not be able to successfully integrate operations that it acquires, including personnel, financial and information systems, cybersecurity measures, distribution, and operating procedures. If the Company fails to successfully integrate acquisitions, the Company’s business could suffer. In addition, acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expense or write-offs of goodwill or other intangibles, any of which could affect the Company’s financial position. The Company also has sometimes divested or discontinued certain operations, assets, and products that did not perform to the Company’s expectations or no longer fit with the Company’s strategic objectives. Divestitures may result in gains, losses, contingent liabilities, write-offs, tax consequences, or other related costs and expenses that could affect the Company’s financial position. Escalade will consider acquisitions, divestitures, and investments in the future, one or more of which, individually or in the aggregate, could be material to the Company’s overall business, operations or financial position. Growth may strain resources, which could adversely affect the Company’s business and financial performance. The Company has grown in the past through strategic acquisitions, and continues to make acquisitions in its Sporting Goods business. Our growth strategy also depends on our ability to grow our e-commerce business, including continued expansion and development of our own direct to consumer e-commerce distribution channel. Growth places additional demands on management and operational systems. If the Company is not successful in continuing to support operational and financial systems, expanding the management team and increasing and effectively managing customers and suppliers, growth may result in operational inefficiencies and ineffective management of the Company’s business, which could adversely affect its business and financial performance. The Company’s ability to operate and expand its business and to respond to changing business and economic conditions will be dependent upon the availability of adequate capital. The rate of expansion will also depend on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn will depend in large part on cash flow generated by the business and the availability of equity and debt capital. The Company can make no assurances that it will be able to obtain equity or debt capital on acceptable terms or at all. Our current senior secured revolving credit facility contains provisions that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or make substantial asset sales, which might otherwise be used to finance our operations. In the event of our insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, the lenders under our senior secured revolving credit facility would be entitled to payment in full from our assets before distributions, if any, to our stockholders. The Company could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled management and key personnel. The Company’s success depends in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified management executives and key personnel. Significant competition for qualified candidates exists in the Company’s business lines and geographic locations. If the Company is not able to hire and retain its executives and key personnel, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain such individuals becomes more expensive, the Company may suffer adverse consequences to its business, operations, and financial condition. 8  The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a few significant customers and loss of any of these customers could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. The Company has two major customers, each of which accounted for more than ten percent of consolidated gross sales in the Company’s 2022 fiscal year. The Company also has several other large customers, none of which represent more than ten percent of consolidated gross sales, and historically has derived substantial revenues from these customers. Our customers continue to experience industry consolidation, which increases our risk that we may be unable to find sufficient alternative customers. The Company needs to continue to expand its customer base, including sales of new product offerings to existing customers, in order to minimize the effects of the loss of any single customer in the future. If sales to one or more of the large customers would be lost or materially reduced, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to replace such revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s customers may experience financial difficulties that could result in losses to the Company. From time to time, one or more of the Company’s customers have experienced, are experiencing, or may in the future experience financial difficulties that impair their ability to pay all amounts owed to the Company. In such instances, the customer may file bankruptcy or take other actions to restructure the amounts owed to secured and unsecured creditors, including unsecured trade creditors such as the Company. When this occurs, the Company may not be able to collect the full amount owed to it by the customer, and in severe situations may have to write off all or a substantial portion of those customer receivables. Any significant resulting losses incurred by the Company relating to these or other customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operation, and financial condition. The Company’s business may be adversely affected by the actions of and risks associated with third-party suppliers. The raw materials that the Company purchases for manufacturing operations and many of the products that it sells are sourced from a wide variety of third-party suppliers. The Company cannot control the supply, design, function or cost of many of the products that are offered for sale and are dependent on the availability and pricing of key materials and products. Disruptions in the availability of raw materials used in production of these products may adversely affect sales and result in customer dissatisfaction. Price increases in raw materials adversely impacted the Company’s net income in fiscal year 2022. In addition, global sourcing of many of the products sold is an important factor in the Company’s financial performance. The ability to find qualified suppliers and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced outside the United States. Political instability, financial instability of suppliers, merchandise quality issues, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, inflation and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond the Company’s control. Historically, instability in the political and economic environments of the countries in which the Company or its suppliers obtain products and raw materials has not had a material adverse effect on operations. However, the Company cannot predict the effect that future changes in economic or political conditions in the United States and in such foreign countries may have on operations. In the event of disruptions or delays in supply due to economic or political conditions, such disruptions or delays could adversely affect results of operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements could be made. In addition, products and materials purchased from alternative sources may be of lesser quality or more expensive than the products and materials currently purchased abroad. 9  Deterioration in relationships with suppliers or in the financial condition of suppliers could adversely affect liquidity, results of operations and financial position. Access to materials, parts and supplies is dependent upon close relationships with suppliers and the ability to purchase products from the principal suppliers on competitive terms. The Company does not enter into long-term supply contracts with these suppliers, and has no current plans to do so in the future. These suppliers are not required to sell to the Company and are free to change the prices and other terms. Any deterioration or change in the relationships with or in the financial condition of the Company’s significant suppliers could have an adverse impact on its ability to procure materials and parts necessary to produce products for sale and distribution. If the Company or any of the significant suppliers terminated or significantly curtailed its relationship with a significant supplier or the Company, respectively, or if a significant supplier ceased operations, the Company would be forced to expand relationships with other suppliers, seek out new relationships with new suppliers or risk a loss in market share due to diminished product offerings and availability. Any change in one or more of these suppliers’ willingness or ability to continue to supply the Company with their products could have an adverse impact on the Company’s liquidity, results of operations and financial position. Disruptions to our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our operations. Many of the Company’s products are manufactured outside the United States. Those products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products could occur due to work stoppages, port strikes, lack of availability of transportation, and other factors beyond the Company’s control. The Company continues to experience increased shipping costs for products obtained from overseas due to a shortage of available shipping containers. If the Company experiences any significant disruption in its supply chain or sharply rising costs, for any reason, such as the coronavirus pandemic, the Company may be unable to satisfy customer demand for our products resulting in lost sales. Such delays and increased costs could impair our ability to timely and efficiently deliver our products, and could adversely impact our operating results. Intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of products. The Company obtains patents, trademarks and copyrights for intellectual property, including its brand names, which represent important assets to the Company. If the Company fails to adequately protect intellectual property through patents, trademarks and copyrights, its intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others, invalidated or challenged, and our competitors could duplicate the Company’s products or may otherwise limit any competitive design or manufacturing advantages. The Company believes that success is likely to depend upon continued innovation, technical expertise, marketing skills, branding, customer support and services rather than on legal protection of intellectual property rights. However, the Company intends to aggressively assert its intellectual property rights when necessary. The expiration or termination of our material trademarks, brand names and licensing agreements could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company has invested substantial resources in developing and marketing the Company’s brands and products over many years. The expiration or termination of one or more of the Company’s material trademarks, patents or licensing agreements could result in the loss of such intellectual property. In such event, the Company may not be able to recoup its investments in, and continue to benefit from the affected brand names or products. The loss of such intellectual property and related rights could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 10  Breaches of data or technology security could damage the Company’s reputation, cause the Company to incur additional expense, expose the Company to litigation, and adversely affect the Company’s business.  A breach of our data or technology security could result in an unauthorized transfer or release of Company proprietary, employee, customer and other Company related information, or the loss of valuable business data or technology, that could cause a disruption in our business. Hackers are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex cyber security attacks. In the event of such an attack, we may expend significant capital and other resources to protect against, respond to, and/or alleviate problems caused by a breach. Such an event could also result in unwanted negative media attention, damage to the Company’s reputation, damage to our customers, and result in lost sales and lawsuits. The Company also must comply with increasingly complex regulatory cyber security and privacy standards, which can be costly and negatively impact the Company’s profitability. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information could harm the Company’s business and its standing with its customers. Through sales and marketing activities, the Company collects and stores certain information that customers provide to purchase products or services or otherwise communicate and interact with the Company. Despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, the Company cannot be certain that all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate the Company’s network security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer or business information. In addition, an employee, a contractor or other third party with whom the Company does business may attempt to circumvent the Company’s security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Loss of customer or business information could disrupt operations, damage the Company’s reputation, and expose the Company to claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. Cybersecurity breaches or other data security incidents could result in unauthorized access, theft, modification, or destruction of Company assets, including bank accounts, intellectual property, and confidential information, which may adversely affect the Company’s business.  The Company has experienced an increase in cybersecurity threats and attempts to breach the Company’s security networks. The techniques used to conduct cyber attacks, including phishing, hacking, and malicious software, are increasingly sophisticated and the sources and targets of these attacks change frequently. Cyber attacks may not be recognized until after attacks have been launched successfully or have been in place for a period of time. From time to time, the Company has been, and likely will continue to be, the target of cyber and other security threats. To the Company’s knowledge, the Company has not experienced a significant cybersecurity breach that had a material impact on the Company’s business or operating results, although there can be no assurance that the Company’s efforts to maintain the security of the Company’s information technology networks and related systems will be effective or that attempted security breaches will not be damaging in the future. The Company maintains cyber liability insurance, however, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that could result from a breach of the Company’s systems. 11  The Company’s business involves the potential for product recalls, warranty liability, product liability, and other claims against us, which could adversely affect our reputation, earnings and financial condition. As a manufacturer, marketer and distributor of consumer products, the Company is subject to the United States Consumer Products Safety Act of 1972, as amended by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, which empowers the Consumer Products Safety Commission (“CPSC”) to recall or exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous. Although recalls of our products have been infrequent, the Company’s subsidiaries voluntarily recalled the Ping Pong Avenger table tennis table in 2021 due to concerns that it could create a potential fall risk to consumers and certain Goalsetter wall-mounted basketball goals in 2022 that could detach and fall to the ground unexpectedly if not installed correctly. Notwithstanding that we extensively and rigorously test our products, there can be no assurance we will be able to detect, prevent, or fix all defects and safety concerns. Under certain circumstances, the CPSC could require us to repurchase or recall additional products, even if we disagree with the defect determination or have data that shows the actual safety risk to be nominal. Any repurchase or recall of our products, monetary judgment, fine or other penalty could be costly and damaging to our reputation and/or adversely affect our brands. Furthermore, the occurrence of any material defects in our products could expose us to liability for warranty claims in excess of our current reserves, and/or to product liability claims that could exceed the limits of our insurance coverage, to the extent coverage may exist. If our warranty reserves and/or insurance coverage are inadequate to cover future warranty claims and/or potential product liability claims, our financial condition and operating results may be harmed. The Company may be subject to various types of litigation, and our insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages related to those claims. From time-to-time the Company may be involved in lawsuits or other claims arising in the ordinary course of business, including those related to product liability, consumer protection, employment, intellectual property, tort, privacy and data protection, and other matters. The Company may incur losses relating to claims filed against it, including costs associated with defending against such claims, and there is risk that any such claims or liabilities will exceed its insurance coverage, or affect the Company’s ability to retain adequate liability insurance in the future. Even if a claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any such assertions could adversely affect the Company’s reputation. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and other claims, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such matters. Unseasonable or extreme weather conditions, alone or together with natural disasters, as well as other catastrophic events, could adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations. Unseasonable or extreme weather conditions, natural disasters and other catastrophic events could negatively impact consumer shopping patterns, consumer confidence and disposable income, or otherwise could have a negative effect on the company’s financial performance. The Company’s business is susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions, particularly as it relates to sports equipment and recreational outdoor products, which could lead to lost sales or greater than expected markdowns. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could reduce demand for a portion of the Company’s inventory and thereby reduce sales and profitability. In addition, extreme weather conditions, natural disasters and other catastrophic events could damage or destroy our facilities, cause staffing shortages or make it difficult for customers to travel to stores and dealers where the Company’s products are sold. Such events and circumstances could negatively affect the Company’s business and results of operations from time to time. 12  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the Company’s business. Additional factors could  exacerbate such consequences and/or cause materially adverse effects. While the COVID-19 pandemic did not materially adversely affect the Company’s financial results and business operations in the Company’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, economic and health conditions in the United States and across most of the globe changed rapidly during 2020, 2021 and 2022. Demand for the Company’s products increased substantially in fiscal years 2020, 2021 and 2022 compared to pre-pandemic sales. Such increased demand may not continue. Although the Company has largely resumed normal operations, continuing impacts of the pandemic may result in future business and manufacturing disruption, inventory shortages, delivery delays, and reduced sales and operations, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The Company cannot predict the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the Company’s customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, but the Company is not able to predict the ultimate consequences that will result therefrom. Although the Company’s largest customer performed well throughout the pandemic, it remains to be seen if consumer demand for online purchasers will continue unabated and/or permanently change the way in which consumers make purchasing decisions. The Company’s second largest customer and many of the Company’s other mass merchant customers experienced increased online orders and reduced foot traffic into their physical stores. In general, many retailers experienced severe financial difficulties and bankruptcies. If those trends persist over the long-term, the Company’s strategies in distributing and marketing its products may need to change accordingly. If the Company’s sales channels are substantially impaired for an extended period of time or fail to adapt to changing consumer preferences, the Company’s sales will be materially reduced. The ultimate magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic is unpredictable, volatile and uncertain.   The COVID-19 pandemic created significant public health concerns and economic disruption and may continue to do so indefinitely. We cannot predict the full impact of the pandemic nor can we predict with any certainty whether and to what degree the disruptions caused by the pandemic and reactions thereto will continue. Much is still unknown, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, the amount of time it may take for more normalized economic activity to resume, future government actions that may be taken, the effects on the Company’s customers and suppliers, including their ability to pay for our products, the effects on operations of the Company’s logistics providers, and the impact on the ability of the Company’s employees to work and travel. Continuing and potential new governmental actions may further cause the Company to modify its business operations or otherwise adversely impact the Company. While the Company has taken numerous steps to mitigate the potential negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to respond quickly enough or appropriately to circumstances that may change rapidly and/or that are outside of our control. The long-term impact of the pandemic on the Company’s business is unknown and ultimately could result in material adverse effects on the Company’s business, financial performance and results of operations. 13  The market price of the Company’s common stock is likely to be highly volatile as the stock market in general can be highly volatile. The public trading of the Company’s common stock is based on many factors which could cause fluctuation in the Company’s stock price. These factors may include, among other things:  ●General economic and market conditions; ●Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results; ●Limited research coverage by securities analysts; ●Relatively low market capitalization resulting in low trading volume in the Company’s stock; ●If securities analysts provide coverage, our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts' estimates or expectations; ●Conditions or trends in the Company’s industries; ●Changes in the market valuations of other companies in the Company’s industries; ●Announcements by the Company or the Company’s competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives; ●Capital commitments; ●Additions or departures of key personnel; ●Tariffs, quotas, customs, import and export restrictions, and other trade barriers; ●Global events, including acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, political instability, natural disasters, and public health crises (such as the COVID 19 pandemic); ●Sales and repurchases of the Company’s common stock; and ●The ability to maintain listing of the Company’s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market and/or inclusion in market indices such as the Russell 2000. Many of these factors are beyond the Company’s control. These factors may cause the market price of the Company’s common stock to decline, regardless of operating performance. If we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.  Our quarterly cash dividend is currently $0.15 per common share. The dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. Our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our Board of Directors (Board) may, at its discretion, increase or decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price. 14  RISKS OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS  International operations expose the Company to the unique risks inherent in foreign operations. The Company sources many of its products and raw materials from Mexico, Brazil, China, Vietnam and other Asian countries. Foreign operations encounter risks similar to those faced by U.S. operations, as well as risks inherent in foreign operations, such as local customs and regulatory constraints, control over product quality and content, foreign trade policies, competitive conditions, foreign currency fluctuations and unstable political and economic conditions. Additionally, our international operations may be adversely affected by political events, domestic or international terrorist events and hostilities, complications due to natural, nuclear or other disasters, or public health crises. For instance, recent government changes in Mexico have yielded requirements that call for increases in minimum wages at the border as well as the interior of Mexico. In addition, beginning in 2020 and continuing into 2021 and 2022, the coronavirus outbreak has resulted in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdown of certain businesses in Mexico, China and other countries in which the Company does business or has suppliers. These or any further political or governmental developments or health concerns in locations in which the Company conducts business could result in social, economic and labor instability. These uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of the Company’s operations and on the Company’s income and profitability. The Company’s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing outside of the United States, and risks arising from tariffs and/or international trade wars. The Company imports many of its raw materials and finished goods from countries outside of the United States, including but not limited to China and Mexico. The Company’s ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may be affected by conditions, such as public health crises, labor disputes, political unrest, and security requirements of the U.S. and other countries that could delay importation of products or require us to locate alternative sources. Our import operations are subject to complex custom laws, regulations, tax requirements, and trade regulations, such as tariffs set by governments through mutual agreements or bilateral actions. U.S. tariffs on goods imported into the U.S., particularly goods from China, have increased the cost of goods purchased by the Company and the ongoing adverse effects of such tariffs potentially could become even more severe. The overall effect of these risks is that our costs may increase, which in turn may result in lower profitability if we are unable to offset such increases through higher prices, and/or that we may suffer a decline in sales if our customers do not accept price increases. The United States, Mexico and Canada have entered into the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (""USMCA""), the successor agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (""NAFTA"") which became effective on July 1, 2020. In January 2020, the United States entered into a ""Phase 1"" trade agreement with China. The Phase 1 agreement expired December 31, 2021 and has not been extended or replaced. Trade negotiations between the United States and China regarding a potential new trade agreement have not progressed and prospects for a new agreement are highly uncertain. Accordingly, it remains unclear what the U.S. administration or foreign governments, including China, specifically will or will not do with respect to tariffs, the USMCA or other international trade agreements and policies. A trade war, other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements, changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently manufacture and sell products or any resulting negative sentiments towards the United States could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. 15  Substantially all of our import operations are subject to customs and tax requirements as well as trade regulations, such as tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements or bilateral actions. In addition, the countries in which our products are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions. Adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions, or our suppliers' failure to comply with customs regulations or similar laws, could harm our business. In this regard, possible changes in U.S. policies and the potential effects of Brexit have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to future tax and trade regulations. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions on imported merchandise or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations that impose requirements that could adversely affect our business, such as setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country. The Company could be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates and/or the value of the United States dollar. The Company is exposed to risks related to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the value of the United States dollar. Changes in currency exchange rates and the value of the United States dollar can have a significant impact on earnings. While the Company carefully watches fluctuations in currency exchange rates, these types of changes can have material adverse effects on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. 16  LEGAL, TAX, ACCOUNTING AND REGULATORY RISKS The Company is subject to risks associated with laws and regulations related to health, safety and environmental protection. Products, and the production and distribution of products, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmental protection. Laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmental protection have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates in the United States and abroad. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. New laws, policies, regulations, rulemaking and oversight, as well as changes to those currently in effect, could adversely impact our earnings, cash flows and operations. Our assets and operations are subject to regulation and oversight by federal, state, and local regulatory authorities. Legislative changes, as well as regulatory actions taken by these agencies, have the potential to adversely affect our profitability. In addition, a certain degree of regulatory uncertainty is created by the U.S. political climate. It remains unclear specifically what the current presidential administration, Congress and the courts may do with respect to future policies, regulations and legal decisions that may affect us. Regulation affects many aspects of our business and extends to such matters as (i) federal, state, and local taxation; (ii) rates (which include tax, commodity, surcharges and fuel); (iii) the integrity, safety and security of facilities and operations; (iv) environmental, social and governance issues that could impact the way we conduct our business; (v) the acquisition of other businesses; (vi) the acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of services or facilities; (vii) reporting and information requirements; and (viii) the maintenance of accounts and records. The preparation of the Company’s financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make significant estimates that may affect financial statements. Due to the inherent nature of making estimates, actual results may vary substantially from such estimates, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For more information on the Company’s critical accounting estimates, please see the Critical Accounting Estimates section of this Form 10-K. Changes in accounting standards could impact reported earnings and financial condition. The accounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and apply and can materially affect how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, which may result in the restatement of prior period financial statements. 17  MACROECONOMIC AND GENERAL BUSINESS RISKS Operating results may be impacted by changes in the economy that influence business and consumer spending. Operating results are directly impacted by the health of the North American and to a lesser extent, European and Asian economies. We cannot predict how robust the economy will be or whether or not it will be sustained. If economic recovery is slow to occur, or if the economy experiences a prolonged period of decelerating or negative growth, the Company’s results of operations may be negatively impacted. In general, the Company’s sales depend on discretionary spending by consumers. Business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions, including unemployment levels, energy costs, interest rates, recession, inflation, the impact of natural disasters and terrorist activities, public health crisis, and other matters that influence business and consumer spending. Fluctuation in economic conditions could prevent the Company from accurately forecasting demand for its products which could adversely affect its operating results or market share. Fluctuation in  economic conditions and market instability in the United States and globally makes it difficult for the Company, customers and suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause the Company to produce and/or purchase excess products that can increase inventory carrying costs and result in obsolete inventory. Alternatively, this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortage of products, or materials used in products, that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for products and a loss of market share. Failure to sustain a continuing economic recovery in the United States and elsewhere could have a substantial adverse effect on our business. Our business is tied to general economic and industry conditions as demand for sporting goods depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumer confidence levels and the availability and cost of credit. These factors have had and could continue to have a substantial impact on our business. Adverse global economic conditions could also cause our customers and suppliers to experience severe economic constraints in the future, including bankruptcy, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. Quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation. Operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, and the Company expects that they will continue to do so in the future. Factors that could cause these quarterly fluctuations include the following: international, national and local general economic and market conditions; the size and growth of the overall sporting goods markets; intense competition among manufacturers, marketers, distributors and sellers of products; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of products and sports; seasonal demand for products; adverse weather conditions that may create fluctuations in demand for certain of our products; the size, timing and mix of purchases of products; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; ability to sustain, manage or forecast growth and inventories; new product development and introduction; ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; performance and reliability of products; customer service; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors; business disruptions; disruptions or delays in our supply chain, including potential disruptions or delays arising from political unrest, war, labor strikes, natural disasters, and public heath crises such as the coronavirus pandemic; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without limitation: exchange rates, import duties, tariffs, quotas and political and economic instability; changes in government regulations; any liability and other claims asserted against the Company; ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and any other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 18  Terrorist attacks, acts of war, natural disasters, and public health crises may seriously harm the Company’s business. Among the chief uncertainties facing the nation and the world and, as a result, our business, is the instability and conflict in the Middle East and uncertainties regarding North Korea, Russia, China and other Asian and European countries. Obviously, no one can predict with certainty what the overall economic impact will be as a result of these circumstances. Terrorist attacks may cause damage or disruption to the Company, employees, facilities and customers, which could significantly impact net sales, costs and expenses and financial condition. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and international responses to terrorist attacks, and other acts of war and hostility may cause greater uncertainty and cause business to suffer in ways the Company currently cannot predict. In addition, any natural disaster or other serious disruption to one of the Company’s manufacturing or distribution sites due to fire, tornado, earthquake or other natural disasters in countries where the Company conducts business, or political unrest, war, labor strikes, work stoppages or public health crises, such as outbreaks of the coronavirus in countries where our suppliers are located could result in the disruption of the Company’s shipments and supply chain of products and raw materials. Although we have continued to obtain product shipments from China and other countries notwithstanding the coronavirus pandemic, product shipments from China and/or other countries may be delayed in the future. Although we are monitoring the situation and have adapted our ordering practices in our attempt to minimize the effects of potential disruptions, the Company cannot predict whether, for how long, or the extent to which the pandemic may disrupt the Company’s supply chain, manufacturing operations, and/or product shipments. Any significant disruption resulting from similar events on a large scale or over a prolonged period could cause significant delays until the Company would be able to resume normal operations or shift to other third party suppliers, if needed. There can be no assurance that alternative capacity could be obtained on favorable terms, if at all, and could negatively affect the Company’s sales and profitability. These risks are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Form 10-K may include additional factors which could adversely impact the Company’s business and financial performance. Moreover, the Company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors, nor can the Company assess the impact of all factors on business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. "
13,ESCA,ESCALADE INC,2022-02-22,"ITEM 1A—RISK FACTORS OPERATIONAL RISKS TO THE COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS  Markets are highly competitive which could limit the Company’s growth and reduce profitability. The market for sporting goods is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. A majority of the Company’s products are in markets that are experiencing low growth rates. Escalade competes with a variety of regional, national and international manufacturers for customers, employees, products, services and other important aspects of the business. The Company has historically sold a large percentage of its sporting goods products to mass merchandisers and has increasingly attempted to expand sales to specialty retailer and dealer markets and to on-line retailers. In addition to competition for sales into those distribution channels, vendors also must compete in sporting goods with large format sporting goods stores, traditional sporting goods stores and chains, warehouse clubs, discount stores and department stores. Competition from on-line retailers may also impact sales. Some of the current and potential competitors are larger than Escalade and have substantially greater financial resources that may be devoted to sourcing, promoting and selling their products, and may discount prices more heavily than the Company can afford. If the Company is unable to predict or effectively react to changes in consumer demand, it may lose customers and sales may decline. Success depends in part on the ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand and preferences regarding sporting goods. Products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. The Company often makes commitments to manufacture products months in advance of the proposed delivery to customers. If Escalade misjudges the market for products, sales may decline significantly. The Company may have to take significant inventory markdowns on unpopular products that are overproduced and/or miss opportunities for other products that may rise in popularity, both of which could have a negative impact on profitability. A major shift in consumer demand away from sporting goods products could also have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.        6                   The Company may pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures, or investments and the failure of a strategic transaction to produce anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate an acquired company could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business. The Company has made acquisitions of complementary companies or businesses, which have been part of the strategic plan, and may continue to pursue acquisitions in the future from time to time. Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, and may result in the diversion of capital and management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities. The Company may not be able to successfully integrate operations that it acquires, including personnel, financial and information systems, cybersecurity measures, distribution, and operating procedures. If the Company fails to successfully integrate acquisitions, the Company’s business could suffer. In addition, acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expense or write-offs of goodwill or other intangibles, any of which could affect the Company’s financial position. The Company also has sometimes divested or discontinued certain operations, assets, and products that did not perform to the Company’s expectations or no longer fit with the Company’s strategic objectives. Divestitures may result in gains, losses, contingent liabilities, write-offs, tax consequences, or other related costs and expenses that could affect the Company’s financial position. Escalade will consider acquisitions, divestitures, and investments in the future, one or more of which, individually or in the aggregate, could be material to the Company’s overall business, operations or financial position. Growth may strain resources, which could adversely affect the Company’s business and financial performance. The Company has grown in the past through strategic acquisitions, and continues to make acquisitions in its Sporting Goods business. Our growth strategy also depends on our ability to grow our e-commerce business, including continued expansion and development of our own direct to consumer e-commerce distribution channel. Growth places additional demands on management and operational systems. If the Company is not successful in continuing to support operational and financial systems, expanding the management team and increasing and effectively managing customers and suppliers, growth may result in operational inefficiencies and ineffective management of the Company’s business, which could adversely affect its business and financial performance. The Company’s ability to operate and expand its business and to respond to changing business and economic conditions will be dependent upon the availability of adequate capital. The rate of expansion will also depend on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn will depend in large part on cash flow generated by the business and the availability of equity and debt capital. The Company can make no assurances that it will be able to obtain equity or debt capital on acceptable terms or at all. Our current senior secured revolving credit facility contains provisions that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or make substantial asset sales, which might otherwise be used to finance our operations. In the event of our insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, the lenders under our senior secured revolving credit facility would be entitled to payment in full from our assets before distributions, if any, to our stockholders. The Company could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled management and key personnel. The Company’s success depends in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified management executives and key personnel. Significant competition for qualified candidates exists in the Company’s business lines and geographic locations. If the Company is not able to hire and retain its executives and key personnel, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain such individuals becomes more expensive, the Company may suffer adverse consequences to its business, operations, and financial condition.        7                   The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a few significant customers and loss of any of these customers could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. The Company has two major customers, each of which accounted for more than ten percent of consolidated gross sales in the Company’s 2021 fiscal year. The Company also has several other large customers, none of which represent more than ten percent of consolidated gross sales, and historically has derived substantial revenues from these customers. Our customers continue to experience industry consolidation, which increases our risk that we may be unable to find sufficient alternative customers. The Company needs to continue to expand its customer base, including sales of new product offerings to existing customers, in order to minimize the effects of the loss of any single customer in the future. If sales to one or more of the large customers would be lost or materially reduced, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to replace such revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s customers may experience financial difficulties that could result in losses to the Company. From time to time, one or more of the Company’s customers have experienced, are experiencing, or may in the future experience financial difficulties that impair their ability to pay all amounts owed to the Company. In such instances, the customer may file bankruptcy or take other actions to restructure the amounts owed to secured and unsecured creditors, including unsecured trade creditors such as the Company. When this occurs, the Company may not be able to collect the full amount owed to it by the customer, and in severe situations may have to write off all or a substantial portion of those customer receivables. Any significant resulting losses incurred by the Company relating to these or other customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operation, and financial condition. The Company’s business may be adversely affected by the actions of and risks associated with third-party suppliers. The raw materials that the Company purchases for manufacturing operations and many of the products that it sells are sourced from a wide variety of third-party suppliers. The Company cannot control the supply, design, function or cost of many of the products that are offered for sale and are dependent on the availability and pricing of key materials and products. Disruptions in the availability of raw materials used in production of these products may adversely affect sales and result in customer dissatisfaction. Price increases in raw materials adversely impacted the Company’s net income in fiscal year 2021. In addition, global sourcing of many of the products sold is an important factor in the Company’s financial performance. The ability to find qualified suppliers and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced outside the United States. Political instability, financial instability of suppliers, merchandise quality issues, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, inflation and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond the Company’s control. Historically, instability in the political and economic environments of the countries in which the Company or its suppliers obtain products and raw materials has not had a material adverse effect on operations. However, the Company cannot predict the effect that future changes in economic or political conditions in the United States and in such foreign countries may have on operations. In the event of disruptions or delays in supply due to economic or political conditions, such disruptions or delays could adversely affect results of operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements could be made. In addition, products and materials purchased from alternative sources may be of lesser quality or more expensive than the products and materials currently purchased abroad.      8             Deterioration in relationships with suppliers or in the financial condition of suppliers could adversely affect liquidity, results of operations and financial position. Access to materials, parts and supplies is dependent upon close relationships with suppliers and the ability to purchase products from the principal suppliers on competitive terms. The Company does not enter into long-term supply contracts with these suppliers, and has no current plans to do so in the future. These suppliers are not required to sell to the Company and are free to change the prices and other terms. Any deterioration or change in the relationships with or in the financial condition of the Company’s significant suppliers could have an adverse impact on its ability to procure materials and parts necessary to produce products for sale and distribution. If the Company or any of the significant suppliers terminated or significantly curtailed its relationship with a significant supplier or the Company, respectively, or if a significant supplier ceased operations, the Company would be forced to expand relationships with other suppliers, seek out new relationships with new suppliers or risk a loss in market share due to diminished product offerings and availability. Any change in one or more of these suppliers’ willingness or ability to continue to supply the Company with their products could have an adverse impact on the Company’s liquidity, results of operations and financial position. Disruptions to our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our operations. Many of the Company’s products are manufactured outside the United States. Those products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products could occur due to work stoppages, port strikes, lack of availability of transportation, and other factors beyond the Company’s control. The Company currently is experiencing increased shipping costs for products obtained from overseas due to a shortage of available shipping containers. If the Company experiences any significant disruption in its supply chain or sharply rising costs, for any reason, such as the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the Company may be unable to satisfy customer demand for our products resulting in lost sales. Such delays and increased costs could impair our ability to timely and efficiently deliver our products, and could adversely impact our operating results. Intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of products. The Company obtains patents, trademarks and copyrights for intellectual property, including its brand names, which represent important assets to the Company. If the Company fails to adequately protect intellectual property through patents, trademarks and copyrights, its intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others, invalidated or challenged, and our competitors could duplicate the Company’s products or may otherwise limit any competitive design or manufacturing advantages. The Company believes that success is likely to depend upon continued innovation, technical expertise, marketing skills, branding, customer support and services rather than on legal protection of intellectual property rights. However, the Company intends to aggressively assert its intellectual property rights when necessary. The expiration or termination of our material trademarks, brand names and licensing agreements could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company has invested substantial resources in developing and marketing the Company’s brands and products over many years. The expiration or termination of one or more of the Company’s material trademarks, patents or licensing agreements could result in the loss of such intellectual property. In such event, the Company may not be able to recoup its investments in, and continue to benefit from the affected brand names or products. The loss of such intellectual property and related rights could have a material adverse effect on the Company.      9             Breaches of data or technology security could damage the Company’s reputation, cause the Company to incur additional expense, expose the Company to litigation, and adversely affect the Company’s business.  A breach of our data or technology security could result in an unauthorized transfer or release of Company proprietary, employee, customer and other Company related information, or the loss of valuable business data or technology, that could cause a disruption in our business. Hackers are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex cyber security attacks. In the event of such an attack, we may expend significant capital and other resources to protect against, respond to, and/or alleviate problems caused by a breach. Such an event could also result in unwanted negative media attention, damage to the Company’s reputation, damage to our customers, and result in lost sales and lawsuits. The Company also must comply with increasingly complex regulatory cyber security and privacy standards, which can be costly and negatively impact the Company’s profitability. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information could harm the Company’s business and its standing with its customers. Through sales and marketing activities, the Company collects and stores certain information that customers provide to purchase products or services or otherwise communicate and interact with the Company. Despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, the Company cannot be certain that all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate the Company’s network security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer or business information. In addition, an employee, a contractor or other third party with whom the Company does business may attempt to circumvent the Company’s security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Loss of customer or business information could disrupt operations, damage the Company’s reputation, and expose the Company to claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. Cybersecurity breaches or other data security incidents could result in unauthorized access, theft, modification, or destruction of Company assets, including bank accounts, intellectual property, and confidential information, which may adversely affect the Company’s business.  The Company has experienced an increase in cybersecurity threats and attempts to breach the Company’s security networks. The techniques used to conduct cyber attacks, including phishing, hacking, and malicious software, are increasingly sophisticated and the sources and targets of these attacks change frequently. Cyber attacks may not be recognized until after attacks have been launched successfully or have been in place for a period of time. From time to time, the Company has been, and likely will continue to be, the target of cyber and other security threats. To the Company’s knowledge, the Company has not experienced a significant cybersecurity breach that had a material impact on the Company’s business or operating results, although there can be no assurance that the Company’s efforts to maintain the security of the Company’s information technology networks and related systems will be effective or that attempted security breaches will not be damaging in the future. The Company maintains cyber liability insurance, however, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that could result from a breach of the Company’s systems.      10             The market price of the Company’s common stock is likely to be highly volatile as the stock market in general can be highly volatile. The public trading of the Company’s common stock is based on many factors which could cause fluctuation in the Company’s stock price. These factors may include, among other things:   ●  General economic and market conditions;   ●  Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;   ●  Limited research coverage by securities analysts;   ●  Relatively low market capitalization resulting in low trading volume in the Company’s stock;   ●  If securities analysts provide coverage, our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts' estimates or expectations;   ●  Conditions or trends in the Company’s industries;   ●  Changes in the market valuations of other companies in the Company’s industries;   ●  Announcements by the Company or the Company’s competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives;   ●  Capital commitments;   ●  Additions or departures of key personnel;   ●  Tariffs, quotas, customs, import and export restrictions, and other trade barriers;   ●  Global events, including acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, political instability, natural disasters, and public health crises (such as the COVID 19 pandemic);   ●  Sales and repurchases of the Company’s common stock; and   ●  The ability to maintain listing of the Company’s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market and/or inclusion in market indices such as the Russell 2000.  Many of these factors are beyond the Company’s control. These factors may cause the market price of the Company’s common stock to decline, regardless of operating performance. If we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.  Our quarterly cash dividend is currently $0.14 per common share. The dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. Our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our Board of Directors (Board) may, at its discretion, increase or decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price.      11             RISKS OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS  International operations expose the Company to the unique risks inherent in foreign operations. The Company has manufacturing operations in Mexico and sources many of its products and raw materials from China and other Asian countries. Foreign operations encounter risks similar to those faced by U.S. operations, as well as risks inherent in foreign operations, such as local customs and regulatory constraints, control over product quality and content, foreign trade policies, competitive conditions, foreign currency fluctuations and unstable political and economic conditions. Additionally, our international operations may be adversely affected by political events, domestic or international terrorist events and hostilities, complications due to natural, nuclear or other disasters, or public health crises. For instance, recent government changes in Mexico have yielded requirements that call for increases in minimum wages at the border as well as the interior of Mexico. In addition, beginning in 2020 and continuing into 2021 and 2022, the ongoing coronavirus outbreak has resulted in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdown of certain businesses in Mexico, China and other countries in which the Company does business or has suppliers. These or any further political or governmental developments or health concerns in locations in which the Company conducts business could result in social, economic and labor instability. These uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of the Company’s operations and on the Company’s income and profitability. The Company’s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing outside of the United States, and risks arising from tariffs and/or international trade wars. The Company imports many of its raw materials and finished goods from countries outside of the United States, including but not limited to China and Mexico. The Company’s ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may be affected by conditions, such as public health crises, labor disputes, political unrest, and security requirements of the U.S. and other countries that could delay importation of products or require us to locate alternative sources. Our import operations are subject to complex custom laws, regulations, tax requirements, and trade regulations, such as tariffs set by governments through mutual agreements or bilateral actions. U.S. tariffs on goods imported into the U.S., particularly goods from China, have increased the cost of goods purchased by the Company and the ongoing adverse effects of such tariffs potentially could become even more severe. The overall effect of these risks is that our costs may increase, which in turn may result in lower profitability if we are unable to offset such increases through higher prices, and/or that we may suffer a decline in sales if our customers do not accept price increases. The United States, Mexico and Canada have entered into the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (""USMCA""), the successor agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (""NAFTA"") which became effective on July 1, 2020. In January 2020, the United States entered into a ""Phase 1"" trade agreement with China. The Phase 1 agreement expired December 31, 2021 and no new agreement has been entered into or appears imminent. Accordingly, it remains unclear what the U.S. administration or foreign governments, including China, specifically will or will not do with respect to tariffs, the USMCA or other international trade agreements and policies. A trade war, other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements, changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently manufacture and sell products or any resulting negative sentiments towards the United States could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.      12             Substantially all of our import operations are subject to customs and tax requirements as well as trade regulations, such as tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements or bilateral actions. In addition, the countries in which our products are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions. Adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions, or our suppliers' failure to comply with customs regulations or similar laws, could harm our business. In this regard, possible changes in U.S. policies and the potential effects of Brexit have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to future tax and trade regulations. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions on imported merchandise or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations that impose requirements that could adversely affect our business, such as setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country. The Company could be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates and/or the value of the United States dollar. The Company is exposed to risks related to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the value of the United States dollar. Changes in currency exchange rates and the value of the United States dollar can have a significant impact on earnings. While the Company carefully watches fluctuations in currency exchange rates, these types of changes can have material adverse effects on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. COVID-19 PANDEMIC RISKS  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the Company’s business. Additional factors could exacerbate such consequences and/or cause materially adverse effects. While the COVID-19 pandemic did not materially adversely affect the Company’s financial results and business operations in the Company’s fiscal year ended December 25, 2021, economic and health conditions in the United States and across most of the globe changed rapidly during 2020 and 2021. Demand for the Company’s products increased, substantially in fiscal year 2020 and remained strong in fiscal year 2021, most notably in our fitness products and also in basketball, playground, and indoor/outdoor games. Some of the increase in demand is likely due to consumers being required or encouraged by governmental authorities to stay at home, schools closures, employers requiring or allowing employees to work remotely and/or implementing furloughs and layoffs, and consumers deciding to spend more time at home due to health and other considerations. Such increased demand may not continue and/or demand may decrease from historical levels depending on the uncertain duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the length of time it takes for normal economic and operating conditions to resume or permanent changes if such conditions result from the pandemic, additional governmental actions that may be taken and/or extensions of time for restrictions that have been imposed or proposed to date, and numerous other uncertainties. During 2020, such restrictions at times caused the Company to shut down its Mexico production facilities, to limit its Gainesville, Florida facility to conduct only shipping and receiving operations but no manufacturing operations, to require all office staff to work remotely, and to change staffing of the Company’s distribution center in Evansville, Indiana. Although the Company largely resumed normal operations in 2021, subject to increased health protocols having been implemented and easing of the pandemic at times, the pandemic continues to create uncertainty for the Company. The ongoing pandemic may result in future business and manufacturing disruption, inventory shortages, delivery delays, and reduced sales and operations, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.      13             The ability of the Company’s employees to work may be significantly impacted by the coronavirus. The Company’s employees are being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although, the recent Omicron outbreak has increased absenteeism, the Company’s operations have not been materially impacted. The effects of future variants could be more disruptive. Travel restrictions imposed by the U.S. government and of foreign countries, continue to limit, or in some cases such as China prohibit, normal business travel relating to the Company’s internal operations and to our ongoing business relationships with our customers and suppliers. The health of the Company’s workforce is of primary concern and the Company may need to continue indefinitely existing precautionary measures, and possibly enact additional measures, to help minimize the risk of our employees being exposed to the coronavirus. Further, our management team continues to focus on mitigating the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has required and will continue to require a large investment of time and resources across the entire Company, thereby potentially diverting their attention from other priorities that existed prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. If these conditions worsen, or last for a further extended period of time, the Company’s ability to manage its business may be impaired, and operational risks, cybersecurity risks and other risks facing the Company even prior to the pandemic may be elevated. The Company cannot predict the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners. The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the Company’s customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, but the Company is not able to assess the full extent of the current impact nor predict the ultimate consequences that will result therefrom. Although Amazon, the Company’s largest customer, has performed well throughout the pandemic, it remains to be seen if consumer demand for online purchasers will continue unabated and/or permanently change the way in which consumers make purchasing decisions. Dick’s Sporting Goods, the Company’s second largest customer, and many of the Company’s other mass merchant customers have experienced increased online orders and reduced foot traffic into their physical stores. In general, many retailers are experiencing severe financial difficulties and bankruptcies. If those trends continue for the long-term, the Company’s strategies in distributing and marketing its products will need to change accordingly. The Company’s planning and efforts in recent years to position itself to ship many goods purchased on Amazon or other online sources direct to consumers and for the Company to make direct to consumer online sales may mitigate some, but not all, of the adverse effects resulting from changes in the businesses of the Company’s resellers. If the Company’s sales channels are substantially impaired for an extended period of time or fail to adapt to changing consumer preferences, the Company’s sales will be materially reduced. The ultimate magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic is unpredictable, volatile and uncertain.  The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant public health concerns and economic disruption and may continue to do so indefinitely. While the Company experienced substantial increases in sales and order activity in its 2020 and 2021 fiscal years compared to 2019, due in part to increased consumer demand for home recreational products during the pandemic, we cannot predict the full impact of the pandemic nor can we predict with any certainty whether and to what degree the disruptions caused by the pandemic and reactions thereto will continue. Much is still unknown, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, the amount of time it may take for more normalized economic activity to resume, future government actions that may be taken, the effects on the Company’s customers and suppliers, including their ability to pay for our products, the effects on operations of the Company’s logistics providers, and the impact on the ability of the Company’s employees to work and travel. Continuing and potential new governmental actions may further cause the Company to modify its business operations or otherwise adversely impact the Company. While the Company has taken numerous steps to mitigate the potential negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to respond quickly enough or appropriately to circumstances that may change rapidly and/or that are outside of our control. The long-term impact of the pandemic on the Company’s business is unknown and ultimately could result in material adverse effects on the Company’s business, financial performance and results of operations.        14                   LEGAL, TAX, ACCOUNTING AND REGULATORY RISKS The Company is subject to risks associated with laws and regulations related to health, safety and environmental protection. Products, and the production and distribution of products, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmental protection. Laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmental protection have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates in the United States and abroad. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. New laws, policies, regulations, rulemaking and oversight, as well as changes to those currently in effect, could adversely impact our earnings, cash flows and operations. Our assets and operations are subject to regulation and oversight by federal, state, and local regulatory authorities. Legislative changes, as well as regulatory actions taken by these agencies, have the potential to adversely affect our profitability. In addition, a certain degree of regulatory uncertainty is created by the U.S. political climate. It remains unclear specifically what the current presidential administration, Congress and the courts may do with respect to future policies, regulations and legal decisions that may affect us. Regulation affects many aspects of our business and extends to such matters as (i) federal, state, and local taxation; (ii) rates (which include tax, commodity, surcharges and fuel); (iii) the integrity, safety and security of facilities and operations; (iv) environmental, social and governance issues that could impact the way we conduct our business; (v) the acquisition of other businesses; (vi) the acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of services or facilities; (vii) reporting and information requirements; and (viii) the maintenance of accounts and records. The preparation of the Company’s financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make significant estimates that may affect financial statements. Due to the inherent nature of making estimates, actual results may vary substantially from such estimates, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For more information on the Company’s critical accounting estimates, please see the Critical Accounting Estimates section of this Form 10-K. Changes in accounting standards could impact reported earnings and financial condition. The accounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and apply and can materially affect how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, which may result in the restatement of prior period financial statements.      15             MACROECONOMIC AND GENERAL BUSINESS RISKS Operating results may be impacted by changes in the economy that influence business and consumer spending. Operating results are directly impacted by the health of the North American and to a lesser extent, European and Asian economies. We cannot predict how robust the economy will be or whether or not it will be sustained. If economic recovery is slow to occur, or if the economy experiences a prolonged period of decelerating or negative growth, the Company’s results of operations may be negatively impacted. In general, the Company’s sales depend on discretionary spending by consumers. Business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions, including unemployment levels, energy costs, interest rates, recession, inflation, the impact of natural disasters and terrorist activities, public health crisis, and other matters that influence business and consumer spending. Fluctuation in economic conditions could prevent the Company from accurately forecasting demand for its products which could adversely affect its operating results or market share. Fluctuation in economic conditions and market instability in the United States and globally makes it difficult for the Company, customers and suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause the Company to produce excess products that can increase inventory carrying costs and result in obsolete inventory. Alternatively, this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortage of products, or materials used in products, that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for products and a loss of market share. Failure to sustain a continuing economic recovery in the United States and elsewhere could have a substantial adverse effect on our business. Our business is tied to general economic and industry conditions as demand for sporting goods depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumer confidence levels and the availability and cost of credit. These factors have had and could continue to have a substantial impact on our business. Adverse global economic conditions could also cause our customers and suppliers to experience severe economic constraints in the future, including bankruptcy, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. Quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation. Operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, and the Company expects that they will continue to do so in the future. Factors that could cause these quarterly fluctuations include the following: international, national and local general economic and market conditions; the size and growth of the overall sporting goods markets; intense competition among manufacturers, marketers, distributors and sellers of products; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of products and sports; seasonal demand for products; adverse weather conditions that may create fluctuations in demand for certain of our products; the size, timing and mix of purchases of products; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; ability to sustain, manage or forecast growth and inventories; new product development and introduction; ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; performance and reliability of products; customer service; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors; business disruptions; disruptions or delays in our supply chain, including potential disruptions or delays arising from political unrest, war, labor strikes, natural disasters, and public heath crises such as the coronavirus pandemic; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without limitation: exchange rates, import duties, tariffs, quotas and political and economic instability; changes in government regulations; any liability and other claims asserted against the Company; ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and any other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.        16                   Terrorist attacks, acts of war, natural disasters, and public health crises may seriously harm the Company’s business. Among the chief uncertainties facing the nation and the world and, as a result, our business, is the instability and conflict in the Middle East and uncertainties regarding North Korea, Russia, China and other Asian and European countries. Obviously, no one can predict with certainty what the overall economic impact will be as a result of these circumstances. Terrorist attacks may cause damage or disruption to the Company, employees, facilities and customers, which could significantly impact net sales, costs and expenses and financial condition. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and international responses to terrorist attacks, and other acts of war and hostility may cause greater uncertainty and cause business to suffer in ways the Company currently cannot predict. In addition, any natural disaster or other serious disruption to one of the Company’s manufacturing or distribution sites due to fire, tornado, earthquake or other natural disasters in countries where the Company conducts business, or political unrest, war, labor strikes, work stoppages or public health crises, such as outbreaks of the coronavirus in countries where our suppliers are located could result in the disruption of the Company’s shipments and supply chain of products and raw materials. Although we have continued to obtain product shipments from China and other countries notwithstanding the coronavirus pandemic, product shipments from China and/or other countries may be delayed in the future. Although we are monitoring the situation and have adapted our ordering practices in our attempt to minimize the effects of potential disruptions, the Company cannot predict whether, for how long, or the extent to which the pandemic may disrupt the Company’s supply chain, manufacturing operations, and/or product shipments. Any significant disruption resulting from similar events on a large scale or over a prolonged period could cause significant delays until the Company would be able to resume normal operations or shift to other third party suppliers, if needed. There can be no assurance that alternative capacity could be obtained on favorable terms, if at all, and could negatively affect the Company’s sales and profitability. These risks are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Form 10-K may include additional factors which could adversely impact the Company’s business and financial performance. Moreover, the Company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors, nor can the Company assess the impact of all factors on business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. "
5,ESCA,ESCALADE INC,2021-02-22,"ITEM 1A—RISK FACTORS OPERATIONAL RISKS TO THE COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESS  Markets are highly competitive which could limit the Company’s growth and reduce profitability. The market for sporting goods is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. A majority of the Company’s products are in markets that are experiencing low growth rates. Escalade competes with a variety of regional, national and international manufacturers for customers, employees, products, services and other important aspects of the business. The Company has historically sold a large percentage of its sporting goods products to mass merchandisers and has increasingly attempted to expand sales to specialty retailer and dealer markets and to on-line retailers. In addition to competition for sales into those distribution channels, vendors also must compete in sporting goods with large format sporting goods stores, traditional sporting goods stores and chains, warehouse clubs, discount stores and department stores. Competition from on-line retailers may also impact sales. Some of the current and potential competitors are larger than Escalade and have substantially greater financial resources that may be devoted to sourcing, promoting and selling their products, and may discount prices more heavily than the Company can afford. If the Company is unable to predict or effectively react to changes in consumer demand, it may lose customers and sales may decline. Success depends in part on the ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand and preferences regarding sporting goods. Products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. The Company often makes commitments to manufacture products months in advance of the proposed delivery to customers. If Escalade misjudges the market for products, sales may decline significantly. The Company may have to take significant inventory markdowns on unpopular products that are overproduced and/or miss opportunities for other products that may rise in popularity, both of which could have a negative impact on profitability. A major shift in consumer demand away from sporting goods products could also have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.        6                   The Company may pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures, or investments and the failure of a strategic transaction to produce anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate an acquired company could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business. The Company has made acquisitions of complementary companies or businesses, which have been part of the strategic plan, and may continue to pursue acquisitions in the future from time to time. Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, and may result in the diversion of capital and management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities. The Company may not be able to successfully integrate operations that it acquires, including personnel, financial and information systems, cybersecurity measures, distribution, and operating procedures. If the Company fails to successfully integrate acquisitions, the Company’s business could suffer. In addition, acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expense or write-offs of goodwill or other intangibles, any of which could affect the Company’s financial position. The Company also has sometimes divested or discontinued certain operations, assets, and products that did not perform to the Company’s expectations or no longer fit with the Company’s strategic objectives. Divestitures may result in gains, losses, contingent liabilities, write-offs, tax consequences, or other related costs and expenses that could affect the Company’s financial position. Escalade will consider acquisitions, divestitures, and investments in the future, one or more of which, individually or in the aggregate, could be material to the Company’s overall business, operations or financial position. Growth may strain resources, which could adversely affect the Company’s business and financial performance. The Company has grown in the past through strategic acquisitions, and continues to make acquisitions in its Sporting Goods business. Our growth strategy also depends on our ability to grow our e-commerce business, including the development of our own direct to consumer e-commerce distribution channel. Growth places additional demands on management and operational systems. If the Company is not successful in continuing to support operational and financial systems, expanding the management team and increasing and effectively managing customers and suppliers, growth may result in operational inefficiencies and ineffective management of the Company’s business, which could adversely affect its business and financial performance. The Company’s ability to operate and expand its business and to respond to changing business and economic conditions will be dependent upon the availability of adequate capital. The rate of expansion will also depend on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn will depend in large part on cash flow generated by the business and the availability of equity and debt capital. The Company can make no assurances that it will be able to obtain equity or debt capital on acceptable terms or at all. Our current senior secured revolving credit facility contains provisions that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or make substantial asset sales, which might otherwise be used to finance our operations. In the event of our insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, the lenders under our senior secured revolving credit facility would be entitled to payment in full from our assets before distributions, if any, to our stockholders. The Company is currently transitioning to a new Interim Chief Executive Officer and will soon commence the process of seeking a new Chief Executive Officer, which may result in some disruption to the Company. On February 22, 2021, the Company announced that former Chief Executive Officer Scott J. Sincerbeaux had resigned from all positions with the Company. While the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Walter P. Glazer, Jr., has agreed to serve as the Company’s Interim Chief Executive Officer until a replacement is hired, the transition may result in some disruptions to the Company’s ordinary course of operations.  Additionally, the process of seeking a new Chief Executive Officer requires substantial effort and time of the Company’s Board of Directors and other executives, which may divert attention from other matters. The Company could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled management and key personnel. The Company’s success depends in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified management executives and key personnel. Significant competition for qualified candidates exists in the Company’s business lines and geographic locations. If the Company is not able to hire and retain its executives and key personnel, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain such individuals becomes more expensive, the Company may suffer adverse consequences to its business, operations, and financial condition. The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a few significant customers and loss of any of these customers could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. The Company has two major customers, each of which accounted for more than ten percent of consolidated gross sales in the Company’s 2020 fiscal year. The Company also has several other large customers, none of which represent more than ten percent of consolidated gross sales, and historically has derived substantial revenues from these customers. Our customers continue to experience industry consolidation, which increases our risk that we may be unable to find sufficient alternative customers. The Company needs to continue to expand its customer base to minimize the effects of the loss of any single customer in the future. If sales to one or more of the large customers would be lost or materially reduced, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to replace such revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.        7                   The Company’s customers may experience financial difficulties that could result in losses to the Company. From time to time, one or more of the Company’s customers have experienced, are experiencing, or may in the future experience financial difficulties that impair their ability to pay all amounts owed to the Company. In such instances, the customer may file bankruptcy or take other actions to restructure the amounts owed to secured and unsecured creditors, including unsecured trade creditors such as the Company. When this occurs, the Company may not be able to collect the full amount owed to it by the customer, and in severe situations may have to write off all or a substantial portion of those customer receivables. Any significant resulting losses incurred by the Company relating to these or other customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operation, and financial condition. The Company’s business may be adversely affected by the actions of and risks associated with third-party suppliers. The raw materials that the Company purchases for manufacturing operations and many of the products that it sells are sourced from a wide variety of third-party suppliers. The Company cannot control the supply, design, function or cost of many of the products that are offered for sale and are dependent on the availability and pricing of key materials and products. Disruptions in the availability of raw materials used in production of these products may adversely affect sales and result in customer dissatisfaction. In addition, global sourcing of many of the products sold is an important factor in the Company’s financial performance. The ability to find qualified suppliers and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced outside the United States. Political instability, financial instability of suppliers, merchandise quality issues, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, inflation and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond the Company’s control. Historically, instability in the political and economic environments of the countries in which the Company or its suppliers obtain products and raw materials has not had a material adverse effect on operations. However, the Company cannot predict the effect that future changes in economic or political conditions in the United States and in such foreign countries may have on operations. In the event of disruptions or delays in supply due to economic or political conditions, such disruptions or delays could adversely affect results of operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements could be made. In addition, products and materials purchased from alternative sources may be of lesser quality or more expensive than the products and materials currently purchased abroad. Deterioration in relationships with suppliers or in the financial condition of suppliers could adversely affect liquidity, results of operations and financial position. Access to materials, parts and supplies is dependent upon close relationships with suppliers and the ability to purchase products from the principal suppliers on competitive terms. The Company does not enter into long-term supply contracts with these suppliers, and has no current plans to do so in the future. These suppliers are not required to sell to the Company and are free to change the prices and other terms. Any deterioration or change in the relationships with or in the financial condition of the Company’s significant suppliers could have an adverse impact on its ability to procure materials and parts necessary to produce products for sale and distribution. If any of the significant suppliers terminated or significantly curtailed its relationship with the Company or ceased operations, the Company would be forced to expand relationships with other suppliers, seek out new relationships with new suppliers or risk a loss in market share due to diminished product offerings and availability. Any change in one or more of these suppliers’ willingness or ability to continue to supply the Company with their products could have an adverse impact on the Company’s liquidity, results of operations and financial position. Disruptions to our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our operations. Many of the Company’s products are manufactured outside the United States. Those products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products could occur due to work stoppages, port strikes, lack of availability of transportation, and other factors beyond the Company’s control. The Company currently is experiencing increased shipping costs for products obtained from overseas due to a shortage of available shipping containers. If the Company experiences any significant disruption in its supply chain or sharply rising costs, for any reason, such as the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the Company may be unable to satisfy customer demand for our products resulting in lost sales. Such delays and increased costs could impair our ability to timely and efficiently deliver our products, and could adversely impact our operating results. Intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of products. The Company obtains patents, trademarks and copyrights for intellectual property, including its brand names, which represent important assets to the Company. If the Company fails to adequately protect intellectual property through patents, trademarks and copyrights, its intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others, invalidated or challenged, and our competitors could duplicate the Company’s products or may otherwise limit any competitive design or manufacturing advantages. The Company believes that success is likely to depend upon continued innovation, technical expertise, marketing skills, branding, customer support and services rather than on legal protection of intellectual property rights. However, the Company intends to aggressively assert its intellectual property rights when necessary.        8                   The expiration or termination of our material trademarks, brand names and licensing agreements could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company has invested substantial resources in developing and marketing the Company’s brands and products over many years. The expiration or termination of one or more of the Company’s material trademarks, patents or licensing agreements could result in the loss of such intellectual property. In such event, the Company may not be able to recoup its investments in, and continue to benefit from the affected brand names or products. The loss of such intellectual property and related rights could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Breaches of data or technology security could damage the Company’s reputation, cause the Company to incur additional expense, expose the Company to litigation, and adversely affect the Company’s business.  A breach of our data or technology security could result in an unauthorized transfer or release of Company proprietary, employee, customer and other Company related information, or the loss of valuable business data or technology, that could cause a disruption in our business. Hackers are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex cyber security attacks. In the event of such an attack, we may expend significant capital and other resources to protect against, respond to, and/or alleviate problems caused by a breach. Such an event could also result in unwanted negative media attention, damage to the Company’s reputation, damage to our customers, and result in lost sales and lawsuits. The Company also must comply with increasingly complex regulatory cyber security and privacy standards, which can be costly and negatively impact the Company’s profitability. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information could harm the Company’s business and its standing with its customers. Through sales and marketing activities, the Company collects and stores certain information that customers provide to purchase products or services or otherwise communicate and interact with the Company. Despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, the Company cannot be certain that all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate the Company’s network security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer or business information. In addition, an employee, a contractor or other third party with whom the Company does business may attempt to circumvent the Company’s security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Loss of customer or business information could disrupt operations, damage the Company’s reputation, and expose the Company to claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. Cybersecurity breaches or other data security incidents could result in unauthorized access, theft, modification, or destruction of Company assets, including bank accounts, intellectual property, and confidential information, which may adversely affect the Company’s business.  The Company has experienced an increase in cybersecurity threats and attempts to breach the Company’s security networks. The techniques used to conduct cyber attacks, including phishing, hacking, and malicious software, are increasingly sophisticated and the sources and targets of these attacks change frequently. Cyber attacks may not be recognized until after attacks have been launched successfully or have been in place for a period of time. From time to time, the Company has been, and likely will continue to be, the target of cyber and other security threats. To the Company’s knowledge, the Company has not experienced a significant cybersecurity breach that had a material impact on the Company’s business or operating results, although there can be no assurance that the Company’s efforts to maintain the security of the Company’s information technology networks and related systems will be effective or that attempted security breaches will not be damaging in the future. The Company maintains cyber liability insurances, however, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business or reputational losses that could result from a breach of the Company’s systems. The market price of the Company’s common stock is likely to be highly volatile as the stock market in general can be highly volatile. The public trading of the Company’s common stock is based on many factors which could cause fluctuation in the Company’s stock price. These factors may include, among other things:   ●  General economic and market conditions;   ●  Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;   ●  Limited research coverage by securities analysts;   ●  Relatively low market capitalization resulting in low trading volume in the Company’s stock;   ●  If securities analysts provide coverage, our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts' estimates or expectations;   ●  Conditions or trends in the Company’s industries;   ●  Changes in the market valuations of other companies in the Company’s industries;   ●  Announcements by the Company or the Company’s competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives;   ●  Capital commitments;   ●  Additions or departures of key personnel;    ●  Tariffs, quotas, customs, import and export restrictions, and other trade barriers;   ●  Global events, including acts or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, political instability, natural disasters, and public health crises;   ●  Sales and repurchases of the Company’s common stock; and   ●  The ability to maintain listing of the Company’s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market.  Many of these factors are beyond the Company’s control. These factors may cause the market price of the Company’s common stock to decline, regardless of operating performance.        9                   If we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.  Our quarterly cash dividend is currently $0.14 per common share. The dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. Our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our Board of Directors (Board) may, at its discretion, increase or decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price. RISKS OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS International operations expose the Company to the unique risks inherent in foreign operations. The Company has manufacturing operations in Mexico and sources many of its products and raw materials from China and other Asian countries. Foreign operations encounter risks similar to those faced by U.S. operations, as well as risks inherent in foreign operations, such as local customs and regulatory constraints, control over product quality and content, foreign trade policies, competitive conditions, foreign currency fluctuations and unstable political and economic conditions. Additionally, our international operations may be adversely affected by political events, domestic or international terrorist events and hostilities, complications due to natural, nuclear or other disasters, or public health crises. For instance, recent government changes in Mexico have yielded requirements that call for increases in minimum wages at the border as well as the interior of Mexico. In addition, beginning in 2020 and continuing into 2021, the ongoing coronavirus outbreak has resulted in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdown of certain businesses in Mexico, China and other countries in which the Company does business or has suppliers. These or any further political or governmental developments or health concerns in locations in which the Company conducts business could result in social, economic and labor instability. These uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of the Company’s operations and on the Company’s income and profitability. The Company’s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing outside of the United States, and risks arising from tariffs and/or international trade wars. The Company imports many of its raw materials and finished goods from countries outside of the United States, including but not limited to China and Mexico. The Company’s ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may be affected by conditions, such as public health crises, labor disputes, political unrest, and security requirements of the U.S. and other countries that could delay importation of products or require us to locate alternative sources. Our import operations are subject to complex custom laws, regulations, tax requirements, and trade regulations, such as tariffs set by governments through mutual agreements or bilateral actions. U.S. tariffs on goods imported into the U.S., particularly goods from China, have increased the cost of goods purchased by the Company and the ongoing adverse effects of such tariffs potentially could become even more severe. The overall effect of these risks is that our costs may increase, which in turn may result in lower profitability if we are unable to offset such increases through higher prices, and/or that we may suffer a decline in sales if our customers do not accept price increases. The United States, Mexico and Canada have entered into the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (""USMCA""), the successor agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (""NAFTA"") which became effective on July 1, 2020. In January 2020, the United States entered into a ""Phase 1"" trade agreement with China. However, it remains unclear what the U.S. administration or foreign governments, including China, specifically will or will not do with respect to tariffs, the USMCA or other international trade agreements and policies. A trade war, other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements, changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently manufacture and sell products or any resulting negative sentiments towards the United States could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Substantially all of our import operations are subject to customs and tax requirements as well as trade regulations, such as tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements or bilateral actions. In addition, the countries in which our products are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions. Adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions, or our suppliers' failure to comply with customs regulations or similar laws, could harm our business. In this regard, possible changes in U.S. policies and the potential effects of Brexit have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to future tax and trade regulations. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions on imported merchandise or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations that impose requirements that could adversely affect our business, such as setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country. The Company could be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates and/or the value of the United States dollar. The Company is exposed to risks related to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the value of the United States dollar. Changes in currency exchange rates and the value of the United States dollar can have a significant impact on earnings. While the Company carefully watches fluctuations in currency exchange rates, these types of changes can have material adverse effects on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.        10                   COVID-19 PANDEMIC RISKS The COVID-19 pandemic currently is affecting the Company’s business. Additional factors could  exacerbate such consequences and/or cause materially adverse effects. While the COVID-19 pandemic did not materially adversely affect the Company’s financial results and business operations in the Company’s fiscal year ended December 26, 2020, economic and health conditions in the United States and across most of the globe changed rapidly during 2020. In the short-term, demand for the Company’s products has increased, notably in our fitness products and also in basketball, playground, and indoor/outdoor games. Some of the increase in demand is likely due to consumers being required or encouraged by governmental authorities to stay at home, schools being closed, and employers requiring employees to work remotely and/or implementing furloughs and layoffs. Such increased demand may not continue and/or demand  may decrease from historical levels depending on the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the length of time it takes for normal economic and operating conditions to resume, additional governmental actions that may be taken and/or extensions of time for restrictions that have been imposed to date, and numerous other uncertainties. During 2020, such restrictions at times caused the Company to shut down its Mexico production facilities, to limit its Gainesville, Florida facility to conduct only shipping and receiving operations but no manufacturing operations, to require all office staff to work remotely, and to change staffing of the Company’s distribution center in Evansville, Indiana. While the Company has largely resumed normal operations in such facilities subject to increased health protocols having been implemented, most of the Company’s office staff continue to work remotely. The ongoing  pandemic may result in future business and manufacturing disruption, inventory shortages, delivery delays, and reduced sales and operations, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The ability of the Company’s employees to work may be significantly impacted by the coronavirus. The Company’s employees are being affected  by the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtually all of our office and  management personnel continue to work remotely. Travel restrictions imposed by the U.S. government and of foreign countries, particularly China and Mexico have limited, or in some cases prohibited, normal business travel relating to the Company’s internal operations and to our ongoing business relationships with our customers and suppliers. The health of the Company’s workforce is of primary concern and the Company may need to continue indefinitely existing precautionary measures, and possibly enact additional measures, to help minimize the risk of our employees being exposed to the coronavirus. Further, our management team continues to focus on mitigating the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has required and will continue to require a large investment of time and resources across the entire Company, thereby potentially diverting their attention from other priorities that existed prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. If these conditions worsen, or last for an extended period of time, the Company’s ability to manage its business may be impaired, and operational risks, cybersecurity risks and other risks facing the Company even prior to the pandemic may be elevated. The Company cannot predict the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners. The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the Company’s customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, but the Company is not able to assess the full extent of the current impact nor predict the ultimate consequences that will result therefrom. Although Amazon, the Company’s largest customer, has performed well throughout the pandemic, it remains to be seen if consumer demand for online purchasers will continue unabated and/or permanently change the way in which consumers make purchasing decisions. Dick’s Sporting Goods, the Company’s second largest customer, and many of the Company’s other mass merchant customers have experienced increased online orders and reduced foot traffic into their physical stores. In general, many retailers are experiencing severe financial difficulties and bankruptcies. If those trends continue for the long-term, the Company’s strategies in distributing and marketing its products will need to change accordingly. The Company’s planning and efforts in recent years to position itself to ship many goods purchased on Amazon or other online sources direct to consumers and for the Company to make direct to consumer online sales may mitigate some, but not all, of the adverse effects resulting from changes in the businesses of the Company’s resellers. If the Company’s sales channels are substantially impaired for an extended period of time or fail to adapt to changing consumer preferences, the Company’s sales will be materially reduced. The ultimate magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic is unpredictable, volatile and uncertain.   The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant public health concerns and economic disruption and may continue to do so indefinitely. While the Company experienced substantial increases in sales and order activity in its 2020 fiscal year, due in part to increased consumer demand for home recreational products during the pandemic, we cannot predict the full impact of the pandemic nor can we predict with any certainty whether and to what degree the disruptions caused by the pandemic and reactions thereto will continue.  Much is unknown, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, the amount of time it may take for more normalized economic activity to resume, future government actions that may be taken, the effects on the Company’s customers and suppliers, including their ability to pay for our products, the effects on operations of the Company’s logistics providers, and the impact on the ability of the Company’s employees to work and travel. Continuing and potential new governmental actions may further cause the Company to modify its business operations or otherwise  adversely impact the Company. While the Company has taken numerous steps to mitigate the potential negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to respond quickly enough or appropriately to circumstances that may change rapidly and/or that are outside of our control. The long-term impact of the pandemic on the Company’s business is unknown and ultimately could result in material adverse effects on the Company’s business, financial performance and results of operations. LEGAL, TAX, ACCOUNTING AND REGULATORY RISKS The Company is subject to risks associated with laws and regulations related to health, safety and environmental protection. Products, and the production and distribution of products, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmental protection. Laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmental protection have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates in the United States and abroad. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.        11                   New laws, policies, regulations, rulemaking and oversight, as well as changes to those currently in effect, could adversely impact our earnings, cash flows and operations. Our assets and operations are subject to regulation and oversight by federal, state, and local regulatory authorities. Legislative changes, as well as regulatory actions taken by these agencies, have the potential to adversely affect our profitability. In addition, a certain degree of regulatory uncertainty is created by the U.S. political climate. It remains unclear specifically what the changes in presidential administration and Congress may do with respect to future policies and regulations that may affect us. Regulation affects many aspects of our business and extends to such matters as (i) federal, state, and local taxation; (ii) rates (which include tax, commodity, surcharges and fuel); (iii) the integrity, safety and security of facilities and operations; (iv) the acquisition of other businesses; (v) the acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of services or facilities; (vi) reporting and information requirements; and (vii) the maintenance of accounts and records. The preparation of the Company’s financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make significant estimates that may affect financial statements. Due to the inherent nature of making estimates, actual results may vary substantially from such estimates, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For more information on the Company’s critical accounting estimates, please see the Critical Accounting Estimates section of this Form 10-K. Changes in accounting standards could impact reported earnings and financial condition. The accounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and apply and can materially affect how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, which may result in the restatement of prior period financial statements. MACROECONOMIC AND GENERAL BUSINESS RISKS Operating results may be impacted by changes in the economy that influence business and consumer spending. Operating results are directly impacted by the health of the North American and to a lesser extent, European and Asian economies. We cannot predict how robust the economy will be or whether or not it will be sustained. If economic recovery is slow to occur, or if the economy experiences a prolonged period of decelerating or negative growth, the Company’s results of operations may be negatively impacted. In general, the Company’s sales depend on discretionary spending by consumers. Business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions, including unemployment levels, energy costs, interest rates, recession, inflation, the impact of natural disasters and terrorist activities, public health crisis, and other matters that influence business and consumer spending. Fluctuation in economic conditions could prevent the Company from accurately forecasting demand for its products which could adversely affect its operating results or market share. Fluctuation in  economic conditions and market instability in the United States and globally makes it difficult for the Company, customers and suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause the Company to produce excess products that can increase inventory carrying costs and result in obsolete inventory. Alternatively, this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortage of products, or materials used in products, that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for products and a loss of market share. Failure to sustain a continuing economic recovery in the United States and elsewhere could have a substantial adverse effect on our business. Our business is tied to general economic and industry conditions as demand for sporting goods depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumer confidence levels and the availability and cost of credit. These factors have had and could continue to have a substantial impact on our business. Certain political developments in recent years have provided increased economic uncertainty. The United Kingdom formally exited the European Union on January 31, 2020 (“Brexit”), and entered into a new trade agreement with the European Union on December 24, 2020. The United Kingdom may set its own trade policies with countries such as the United States, Australia and New Zealand that currently do not have free trade agreements with the European Union. Although the Company may not be directly impacted by Brexit, these and future trade deals could subject the rest of the world to tariffs and duties set by the World Trade Organization, potentially resulting in higher import costs on the Company’s products and raw materials. In addition, political conflicts in the U.S. could result in economic and trade policy actions that would impact economic conditions in various countries, the cost of importing into the U.S. and the competitive landscape of our customers, suppliers and competitors. Adverse global economic conditions could also cause our customers and suppliers to experience severe economic constraints in the future, including bankruptcy, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.        12                   Quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation. Operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, and the Company expects that they will continue to do so in the future. Factors that could cause these quarterly fluctuations include the following:  international, national and local general economic and market conditions; the size and growth of the overall sporting goods markets; intense competition among manufacturers, marketers, distributors and sellers of products; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of products and sports; seasonal demand for products; adverse weather conditions that may create fluctuations in demand for certain of our products; the size, timing and mix of purchases of products; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; ability to sustain, manage or forecast growth and inventories; new product development and introduction; ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; performance and reliability of products; customer service; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors; business disruptions; disruptions or delays in our supply chain, including potential disruptions or delays arising from political unrest, war, labor strikes, natural disasters, and public heath crises such as the coronavirus pandemic; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without limitation: exchange rates, import duties, tariffs, quotas and political and economic instability; changes in government regulations; any liability and other claims asserted against the Company; ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and any other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Terrorist attacks, acts of war, natural disasters, and public health crises may seriously harm the Company’s business. Among the chief uncertainties facing the nation and the world and, as a result, our business, is the instability and conflict in the Middle East and uncertainties regarding North Korea, Russia, China and other Asian and European countries. Obviously, no one can predict with certainty what the overall economic impact will be as a result of these circumstances. Terrorist attacks may cause damage or disruption to the Company, employees, facilities and customers, which could significantly impact net sales, costs and expenses and financial condition. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and international responses to terrorist attacks, and other acts of war and hostility may cause greater uncertainty and cause business to suffer in ways the Company currently cannot predict. In addition, any natural disaster or other serious disruption to one of the Company’s manufacturing or distribution sites due to fire, tornado, earthquake or other natural disasters in countries where the Company conducts business, or political unrest, war, labor strikes, work stoppages or public health crises, such as outbreaks of the coronavirus in countries where our suppliers are located could result in the disruption of the Company’s shipments and supply chain of products and raw materials. Although we have continued to obtain product shipments from China notwithstanding the coronavirus pandemic, product shipments from China may be delayed in the future. Although we are monitoring the situation and have adapted our ordering practices in our attempt to minimize the effects of potential disruptions, the Company cannot predict whether, for how long, or the extent to which the pandemic may disrupt the Company’s supply chain, manufacturing operations, and/or product shipments. Any significant disruption resulting from similar events on a large scale or over a prolonged period could cause significant delays until the Company would be able to resume normal operations or shift to other third party suppliers, if needed. There can be no assurance that alternative capacity could be obtained on favorable terms, if at all, and could negatively affect the Company’s sales and profitability.        13                   These risks are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Form 10-K may include additional factors which could adversely impact the Company’s business and financial performance. Moreover, the Company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors, nor can the Company assess the impact of all factors on business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. "
0,ESCA,ESCALADE INC,2020-02-21,"ITEM 1A—RISK FACTORS Operating results may be impactedby changes in the economy that influence business and consumer spending. Operating resultsare directly impacted by the health of the North American and to a lesser extent, European and Asian economies. We cannot predicthow robust the economy will be or whether or not it will be sustained. If the economic recovery slows, or if the economy experiencesa prolonged period of decelerating or negative growth, the Company’s results of operations may be negatively impacted. Ingeneral, the Company’s sales depend on discretionary spending by consumers. Business and financial performance may be adverselyaffected by current and future economic conditions, including unemployment levels, energy costs, interest rates, recession, inflation,the impact of natural disasters and terrorist activities, and other matters that influence business and consumer spending. Fluctuationin economic conditions could prevent the Company from accurately forecasting demand for its products which could adversely affectits operating results or market share. Fluctuation ineconomic conditions and market instability in the United States and globally makes it difficult for the Company, customers andsuppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause the Company to produce excess products that canincrease inventory carrying costs and result in obsolete inventory. Alternatively, this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortageof products, or materials used in products, that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for products and a loss of marketshare. Markets are highly competitive whichcould limit the Company’s growth and reduce profitability. The market for sporting goods is highlyfragmented and intensely competitive. A majority of the Company’s products are in markets that are experiencing low growthrates. Escalade competes with a variety of regional, national and international manufacturers for customers, employees, products,services and other important aspects of the business. The Company has historically sold a large percentage of its sporting goodsproducts to mass merchandisers and has increasingly attempted to expand sales to specialty retailer and dealer markets and to on-lineretailers. In addition to competition for sales into those distribution channels, vendors also must compete in sporting goods withlarge format sporting goods stores, traditional sporting goods stores and chains, warehouse clubs, discount stores and departmentstores. Competition from on-line retailers may also impact sales. Some of the current and potential competitors are larger thanEscalade and have substantially greater financial resources that may be devoted to sourcing, promoting and selling their products,and may discount prices more heavily than the Company can afford. If the Company is unable to predictor effectively react to changes in consumer demand, it may lose customers and sales may decline. Successdepends in part on the ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand and preferencesregarding sporting goods. Products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted withcertainty and are subject to change. The Company often makes commitments to manufacture products months in advance of theproposed delivery to customers. If Escalade misjudges the market for products, sales may decline significantly. The Companymay have to take significant inventory markdowns on unpopular products that are overproduced and/or miss opportunities forother products that may rise in popularity, both of which could have a negative impact on profitability. A major shift inconsumer demand away from sporting goods products could also have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business,results of operations and financial condition. 5  The Company derives a substantialportion of its revenue from a few significant customers and loss of any of these customers could materially affect our resultsof operations and financial condition. The Company has two major customers, eachof which accounted for more than ten percent of consolidated gross sales and more than ten percent of total accounts receivable.The Company also has several other large customers, none of which represent more than ten percent of consolidated gross sales,and historically has derived substantial revenues from these customers. Our customers continue to experience industry consolidation,which increases our risk that we may be unable to find sufficient alternative customers. The Company needs to continue to expandits customer base to minimize the effects of the loss of any single customer in the future. If sales to one or more of the largecustomers would be lost or materially reduced, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to replace such revenues,which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s customers mayexperience financial difficulties that could result in losses to the Company. From time to time, one or more of the Company’scustomers have experienced, are experiencing, or may in the future experience financial difficulties that impair their abilityto pay all amounts owed to the Company. In such instances, the customer may file bankruptcy or take other actions to restructurethe amounts owed to secured and unsecured creditors, including unsecured trade creditors such as the Company. When this occurs,the Company may not be able to collect the full amount owed to it by the customer, and in severe situations may have to write offall or a substantial portion of those customer receivables. Any significant resulting losses incurred by the Company relating tothese or other customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operation, and financialcondition. Quarterly operating results are subjectto fluctuation. Operating resultshave fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, and the Company expects that they will continue to do so in the future. Factorsthat could cause these quarterly fluctuations include the following: international, national and local general economicand market conditions; the size and growth of the overall sporting goods markets; intense competition among manufacturers, marketers,distributors and sellers of products; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categoriesof products and sports; seasonal demand for products; adverse weather conditions that may create fluctuations in demand for certainof our products; the size, timing and mix of purchases of products; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results;ability to sustain, manage or forecast growth and inventories; new product development and introduction; ability to secure andprotect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; performance and reliability of products; customer service; the lossof significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors; business disruptions; disruptions or delays in our supply chain,including potential disruptions or delays arising from political unrest, war, labor strikes, natural disasters, and public heathcrises such as the coronavirus pandemic; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; changes in businessstrategy or development plans; general risks associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without limitation:exchange rates, import duties, tariffs, quotas and political and economic instability; changes in government regulations; any liabilityand other claims asserted against the Company; ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and other factors referencedor incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and any other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 6  The Companymay pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures, or investments and the failure of a strategic transaction to produce anticipatedresults or the inability to fully integrate an acquired company could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business. The Company hasmade acquisitions of complementary companies or businesses, which have been part of the strategic plan, and may continue to pursueacquisitions in the future from time to time. Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, and mayresult in the diversion of capital and management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities. The Company maynot be able to successfully integrate operations that it acquires, including personnel, financial systems, distribution, and operatingprocedures. If the Company fails to successfully integrate acquisitions, the Company’s business could suffer. In addition,acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expense or write-offs of goodwill or otherintangibles, any of which could affect the Company’s financial position. The Company also has sometimes divested or discontinuedcertain operations, assets, and products that did not perform to the Company’s expectations or no longer fit with the Company’sstrategic objectives. Divestitures may result in gains, losses, contingent liabilities, write-offs, tax consequences, or otherrelated costs and expenses that could affect the Company’s financial position. Escalade will consider acquisitions, divestitures,and investments in the future, one or more of which, individually or in the aggregate, could be material to the Company’soverall business, operations or financial position. Growth may strain resources, whichcould adversely affect the Company’s business and financial performance. The Company has grown in the past throughstrategic acquisitions, and continues to make acquisitions in its Sporting Goods business. Our growth strategy also depends onour ability to grow our e-commerce business. Growth places additional demands on management and operational systems. If the Companyis not successful in continuing to support operational and financial systems, expanding the management team and increasing andeffectively managing customers and suppliers, growth may result in operational inefficiencies and ineffective management of theCompany’s business, which could adversely affect its business and financial performance. The Company’sability to operate and expand business and to respond to changing business and economic conditions will be dependent upon the availabilityof adequate capital. The rate of expansionwill also depend on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn will depend in large part on cash flow generated by thebusiness and the availability of equity and debt capital. The Company can make no assurances that it will be able to obtain equityor debt capital on acceptable terms or at all. Our current senior secured revolving credit facility contains provisions that limitour ability to incur additional indebtedness or make substantial asset sales, which might otherwise be used to finance our operations.In the event of our insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, the lenders under our senior secured revolving creditfacility would be entitled to payment in full from our assets before distributions, if any, to our stockholders. The Companycould suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled management and key personnel. The Company’ssuccess depends in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified management executives and key personnel. Significantcompetition for qualified candidates exists in the Company’s business lines and geographic locations. If the Company is notable to hire and retain its executives and key personnel, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain such individualsbecomes more expensive, the Company may suffer adverse consequences to its business, operations, and financial condition. 7  The Companyis currently in the process of seeking a new Chief Executive Officer, which creates uncertainty, and the transition may resultin some disruption to the Company.  In November, 2019,the Company and its current Chief Executive Officer, David L. Fetherman, announced that Mr. Fetherman is retiring from all positionswith the Company. Although Mr. Fetherman has agreed to continue to serve as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer until hissuccessor has been hired and starts employment with the Company, the transition of leadership may result in some disruption tothe Company’s ordinary course of operations. The process of seeking a new Chief Executive Officer requires substantial effortand time of the Company’s Board of Directors and other executives, which may divert attention from other matters. In addition,pending the hiring of a new Chief Executive Officer and that individual integrating himself or herself into the Company, the Company’sofficers and employees may be uncertain as to the effects of the change in leadership on the Company, the Company’s customersand suppliers, and themselves. The Company’s business maybe adversely affected by the actions of and risks associated with third-party suppliers. The raw materials that the Company purchasesfor manufacturing operations and many of the products that it sells are sourced from a wide variety of third-party suppliers. TheCompany cannot control the supply, design, function or cost of many of the products that are offered for sale and are dependenton the availability and pricing of key materials and products. Disruptions in the availability of raw materials used in productionof these products may adversely affect sales and result in customer dissatisfaction. In addition, global sourcing of many of theproducts sold is an important factor in the Company’s financial performance. The ability to find qualified suppliers andto access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced outsidethe United States. Political instability, financial instability of suppliers, merchandise quality issues, trade restrictions, tariffs,currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, inflation and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond the Company’scontrol. Historically,instability in the political and economic environments of the countries in which the Company or its suppliers obtain products andraw materials has not had a material adverse effect on operations. However, the Company cannot predict the effect that future changesin economic or political conditions in the United States and in such foreign countries may have on operations. In the event ofdisruptions or delays in supply due to economic or political conditions, such disruptions or delays could adversely affect resultsof operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements could be made. In addition, products and materials purchased fromalternative sources may be of lesser quality or more expensive than the products and materials currently purchased abroad. Deteriorationin relationships with suppliers or in the financial condition of suppliers could adversely affect liquidity, results of operationsand financial position. Access to materials,parts and supplies is dependent upon close relationships with suppliers and the ability to purchase products from the principalsuppliers on competitive terms. The Company does not enter into long-term supply contracts with these suppliers, and has no currentplans to do so in the future. These suppliers are not required to sell to the Company and are free to change the prices and otherterms. Any deterioration or change in the relationships with or in the financial condition of the Company’s significant supplierscould have an adverse impact on its ability to procure materials and parts necessary to produce products for sale and distribution.If any of the significant suppliers terminated or significantly curtailed its relationship with the Company or ceased operations,the Company would be forced to expand relationships with other suppliers, seek out new relationships with new suppliers or riska loss in market share due to diminished product offerings and availability. Any change in one or more of these suppliers’willingness or ability to continue to supply the Company with their products could have an adverse impact on the Company’sliquidity, results of operations and financial position. 8  Disruptionsto our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our operations. Many of the Company’sproducts are manufactured outside the United States. Those products must be transported by third parties over large geographicdistances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products could occur due to work stoppages, port strikes, lack of availabilityof transportation, and other factors beyond the Company’s control. If the Company experiences any significant disruptionin its supply chain for any reason, such as the recent coronavirus pandemic, the Company may be unable to satisfy customer demandfor our products resulting in lost sales. Such delays could impair our ability to timely and efficiently deliver our products,and could adversely impact our operating results. The Company may be subject to productwarranty claims that require the replacement or repair of the product sold. Such warranty claims could adversely affect the Company’sfinancial position and relationships with its customers. The Company manufactures and/or distributesa variety of products. From time to time, such products may contain manufacturing defects or design flaws that are not detectedprior to sale, particularly as to new product introductions or upon design changes to existing products. The failure to identifyand correct manufacturing defects and product design issues prior to the sale of those products could result in product warrantyclaims that result in costs to replace or repair any such defective products. Because many of the Company’s products aresold to retailers for broad consumer distribution and/or to customers who buy in large quantities, the costs associated with productwarranty claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial position. Productwarranty claims also could cause customer dissatisfaction that may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s reputationand on the Company’s relationships with its customers, which may result in lost or reduced sales. The Company may be subject to varioustypes of litigation and the Company’s insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages related to those claims. From time to timethe Company or its subsidiaries may be involved in lawsuits or other claims arising in the course of business, including thoserelated to product liability, consumer protection, employment, intellectual property, torts and other matters. In addition, itmay be subject to lawsuits relating to the design, manufacture or distribution of its products. The Company may be subject to lawsuitsresulting from injuries associated with the use of sporting goods equipment that it sells and information security and print finishingproducts that it sold prior to divesting that business. The Company may incur losses relating to these claims or the defense ofthese claims. There is a risk that claims or liabilities will exceed the Company’s insurance coverage. In addition, the Companymay be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future. Further, the Company is subject to regulation by the ConsumerProduct Safety Commission and similar state regulatory agencies. If the Company fails to comply with government and industry safetystandards, it may be subject to claims, lawsuits, fines, product recalls and adverse publicity that could have a material adverseeffect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Intellectual property rights arevaluable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of products. The Company obtainspatents, trademarks and copyrights for intellectual property, which represent important assets to the Company. If the Company failsto adequately protect intellectual property through patents, trademarks and copyrights, its intellectual property rights may bemisappropriated by others, invalidated or challenged, and our competitors could duplicate the Company’s products or may otherwiselimit any competitive design or manufacturing advantages. The Company believes that success is likely to depend upon continuedinnovation, technical expertise, marketing skills and customer support and services rather than on legal protection of intellectualproperty rights. However, the Company intends to aggressively assert its intellectual property rights when necessary. 9  The expiration or termination ofour material trademarks, brand names and licensing agreements could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company hasinvested substantial resources in developing and marketing the Company’s brands and products over many years. The expirationor termination of one or more of the Company’s material trademarks, patents or licensing agreements could result in the lossof such intellectual property. In such event, the Company may not be able to recoup its investments in, and continue to benefitfrom the affected brand names or products. The loss of such intellectual property and related rights could have a material adverseeffect on the Company. The Company is subject to risks associatedwith laws and regulations related to health, safety and environmental protection. Products, andthe production and distribution of products, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmentalprotection. Laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmental protection have been passed in several jurisdictionsin which the Company operates in the United States and abroad. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effectsbased on the nature of operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will nothave a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. International operations expose theCompany to the unique risks inherent in foreign operations. The Company has manufacturing operationsin Mexico and sources many of its products and raw materials from China and other Asian countries. Foreign operations encounterrisks similar to those faced by U.S. operations, as well as risks inherent in foreign operations, such as local customs and regulatoryconstraints, control over product quality and content, foreign trade policies, competitive conditions, foreign currency fluctuationsand unstable political and economic conditions. Additionally, our international operations may be adversely affected by politicalevents, domestic or international terrorist events and hostilities or complications due to natural, nuclear or other disasters.For instance, recent government changes in Mexico have yielded requirements that call for increases in minimum wages at the borderas well as the interior of Mexico. In addition, the ongoing coronavirus outbreak emanating from China at the beginning of 2020has resulted in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdown of certain businesses in the region. These or any further politicalor governmental developments or health concerns in Mexico, China or other countries in which the Company conducts business couldresult in social, economic and labor instability. These uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on the continuity ofthe Company’s operations and on the Company’s income and profitability. The Company could be adversely affectedby changes in currency exchange rates and/or the value of the United States dollar. The Company is exposed to risks relatedto the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the value of the United States dollar. Changes in currency exchangerates and the value of the United States dollar can have a significant impact on earnings. While the Company carefully watchesfluctuations in currency exchange rates, these types of changes can have material adverse effects on the Company’s business,results of operations and financial condition. Failure to improve and maintain thequality of internal controls over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the ability to provide timely and accuratefinancial information, which could harm the Company’s reputation and share price. Management is responsible forestablishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting for the Company to provide reasonableassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance withgenerally accepted accounting principles. Management cannot be certain that weaknesses and deficiencies in internal controlswill not arise or be identified or that the Company will be able to correct and maintain adequate controls over financialprocesses and reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain adequate controls, to adequately implement required new orimproved controls, or to successfully and timely integrate acquired businesses into the Company’s financial reportingand internal controls could harm operating results or cause failure to meet reporting obligations in a timely and accuratemanner. Ineffective internal controls over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in reportedfinancial information, which could adversely affect the trading price of the Company’s common stock. 10  Disclosure controls and procedures aredesigned to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, management, including the Chief Executive Officerand Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A controlsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives ofthe control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems,no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Problems with the Company’s informationsystem software or hardware could disrupt operations and negatively impact financial results and materially adversely affect theCompany’s business operations.  The Company relies on a suite of applicationsand third-party software to receive and process customer orders and for the core of its manufacturing, distribution, and accountingsystems. These systems, if not functioning properly, could disrupt its operations, including the Company’s ability to receiveand ship orders and to process financial information or engage in similar normal business activities. Any material disruption,malfunction, cyber-attack or other similar problems in or with these systems could negatively impact our financial results andmaterially adversely affect our business operations. Breaches of data or technology securitycould damage the Company’s reputation, cause the Company to incur additional expense, expose the Company to litigation, andadversely affect the Company’s business.  A breach of our data or technology securitycould result in an unauthorized transfer or release of Company proprietary, employee, customer and other Company related information,or the loss of valuable business data or technology, that could cause a disruption in our business. Hackers are increasingly sophisticatedand operate large scale and complex cyber security attacks. In the event of such an attack, we may expend significant capital andother resources to protect against, respond to, and/or alleviate problems caused by a breach. Such an event could also result inunwanted negative media attention, damage to the Company’s reputation, damage to our customers, and result in lost salesand lawsuits. The Company also must comply with increasingly complex regulatory cyber security and privacy standards, which canbe costly and negatively impact the Company’s profitability. The preparation of the Company’sfinancial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results. The preparation of consolidated financialstatements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make significantestimates that may affect financial statements. Due to the inherent nature of making estimates, actual results may vary substantiallyfrom such estimates, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financialcondition. For more information on the Company’s critical accounting estimates, please see the Critical Accounting Estimatessection of this Form 10-K. 11  Changes in accounting standards couldimpact reported earnings and financial condition. The accounting standard setters, includingthe Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, periodically change the financial accountingand reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. These changes canbe hard to predict and apply and can materially affect how the Company records and reports its financial condition and resultsof operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, which may resultin the restatement of prior period financial statements. The Company’s effective tax ratemay fluctuate. The Company is a multi-channel providerof sporting goods. As a result, the Company’s effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates inthe various countries, states and other jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In addition to the effects of the 2017 U.S.Tax Reforms, the effective tax rate may be lower or higher than its tax rates have been in the past due to numerous factors, includingthe sources of income, any agreement with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, the tax filing positions taken in variousjurisdictions and changes in the political environment in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The Company bases estimatesof an effective tax rate at any given point in time upon a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to the Company and to estimatesof the amount of business likely to be done in any given jurisdiction. The loss of one or more agreements with taxing jurisdictions,a change in the mix of business from year to year and from country to country, changes in rules related to accounting for incometaxes, changes in tax laws and any of the multiple jurisdictions in which the Company operates, or adverse outcomes from tax auditsthat the Company may be subject to in any of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, could result in an unfavorable changein the effective tax rate which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The market price of the Company’scommon stock is likely to be highly volatile as the stock market in general can be highly volatile. The public trading of the Company’scommon stock is based on many factors which could cause fluctuation in the Company’s stock price. These factors may include,among other things:   ·General economic and market    conditions;  ·Actual or anticipated variations    in quarterly operating results;  ·Limited research coverage by    securities analysts;  ·Relatively low market capitalization    resulting in low trading volume in the Company’s stock;  ·If securities analysts provide    coverage, our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts' estimates or expectations;  ·Conditions or trends in the    Company’s industries;  ·Changes in the market valuations    of other companies in the Company’s industries;  ·Announcements by the Company    or the Company’s competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other    strategic initiatives;  ·Capital commitments;  ·Additions or departures of    key personnel;  ·Tariffs, quotas, customs, import    and export restrictions, and other trade barriers;  ·Global events, including acts    or threats of war or terrorism, international conflicts, political instability, natural disasters, and public health crises;  ·Sales and repurchases of the    Company’s common stock; and  ·The ability to maintain listing    of the Company’s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market. Many of thesefactors are beyond the Company’s control. These factors may cause the market price of the Company’s common stock todecline, regardless of operating performance. 12  If we are unable to pay quarterlydividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.  Our quarterly cash dividend is currently$0.125 per common share. The dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. Our ability to pay dividends willdepend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certaineconomic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our Board of Directors (Board) may, at its discretion,increase or decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Any failureto pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in usand negatively impact our stock price.  Unauthorizeddisclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information could harm the Company’s business and its standing with itscustomers. Through sales and marketing activities,the Company collects and stores certain information that customers provide to purchase products or services or otherwise communicateand interact with the Company. Despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, the Company cannot be certainthat all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate the Company’snetwork security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer or business information. In addition, an employee, acontractor or other third party with whom the Company does business may attempt to circumvent the Company’s security measuresin order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Loss of customer or business informationcould disrupt operations, damage the Company’s reputation, and expose the Company to claims from customers, financial institutions,payment card associations and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, resultsof operations and financial condition. In addition, compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standardsmay result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. Terroristattacks, acts of war, natural disasters, and public health crises may seriously harm the Company’s business. Among the chiefuncertainties facing the nation and the world and, as a result, our business, is the instability and conflict in the Middle Eastand uncertainties regarding North Korea, Russia, China and other Asian and European countries. Obviously, no one can predict withcertainty what the overall economic impact will be as a result of these circumstances. Terrorist attacks may cause damage or disruptionto the Company, employees, facilities and customers, which could significantly impact net sales, costs and expenses and financialcondition. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and international responses to terrorist attacks, and otheracts of war and hostility may cause greater uncertainty and cause business to suffer in ways the Company currently cannot predict. In addition, anynatural disaster or other serious disruption to one of the Company’s manufacturing or distribution sites due to fire, tornado,earthquake or other natural disasters in countries where the Company conducts business, or political unrest, war, labor strikes,work stoppages or public health crises, such as outbreaks of the coronavirus in countries where our suppliers are located couldresult in the disruption of the Company’s shipments and supply chain of products and raw materials. Due to the recent outbreakof the coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China, certain of our product shipments from China may be delayed. Although we are monitoringthe situation, the Company cannot predict whether, for how long, or the extent to which the outbreak may disrupt the Company’ssupply chain, manufacturing operations, and/or product shipments. Any significant disruption resulting from similar events on alarge scale or over a prolonged period could cause significant delays until the Company would be able to resume normal operationsor shift to other third party suppliers, if needed. There can be no assurance that alternative capacity could be obtained on favorableterms, if at all, and could negatively affect the Company’s sales and profitability. 13  New laws, policies, regulations,rulemaking and oversight, as well as changes to those currently in effect, could adversely impact our earnings, cash flows andoperations. Our assets and operations are subject toregulation and oversight by federal, state, and local regulatory authorities. Legislative changes, as well as regulatory actionstaken by these agencies, have the potential to adversely affect our profitability. In addition, a certain degree of regulatoryuncertainty is created by the U.S. political climate. It remains unclear specifically what the current presidential administrationand Congress may do with respect to future policies and regulations that may affect us. Regulation affects many aspects of ourbusiness and extends to such matters as (i) federal, state, and local taxation; (ii) rates (which include tax, commodity, surchargesand fuel); (iii) the integrity, safety and security of facilities and operations; (iv) the acquisition of other businesses; (v)the acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of services or facilities; (vi) reporting and information requirements;and (vii) the maintenance of accounts and records. Failure to sustain a continuing economicrecovery in the United States and elsewhere could have a substantial adverse effect on our business. Our business is tied to general economicand industry conditions as demand for sporting goods depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumerconfidence levels and the availability and cost of credit. These factors have had and could continue to have a substantial impacton our business. Certain political developments in recentyears have provided increased economic uncertainty. The United Kingdom formally exited the European Union on January 31,2020 (“Brexit”),and is now in a transition period until the end of 2020 to negotiate a new trade agreement with the European Union. Although theCompany may not be directly impacted by Brexit, the absence of a future trade deal could subject the rest of the world to tariffsand duties set by the World Trade Organization, resulting in higher import costs on the Company’s products and raw materials.In addition, political conflicts in the U.S. could result in economic and trade policy actions that would impact economic conditionsin various countries, the cost of importing into the U.S. and the competitive landscape of our customers, suppliers and competitors. Adverse global economic conditions couldalso cause our customers and suppliers to experience severe economic constraints in the future, including bankruptcy, which couldhave a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. The Company’s business is subjectto risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing outside of the United States, and risks arising from tariffs and/or internationaltrade wars. The Company imports many of its raw materialsand finished goods from countries outside of the United States, including but not limited to China and Mexico. The Company’sability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may be affected by conditions, such as labor disputes, politicalunrest, and security requirements of the U.S. and other countries that could delay importation of products or require us to locatealternative sources. Our import operations are subject to complex custom laws, regulations, tax requirements, and trade regulations,such as tariffs set by governments through mutual agreements or bilateral actions. Recent changes in U.S. tariffs on goods importedinto the U.S., particularly goods from China, have increased the cost of goods purchased by the Company and the ongoing adverseeffects of such tariffs potentially could become even more severe. The overall effect of these risks is that our costs may increase,which in turn may result in lower profitability if we are unable to offset such increases through higher prices, and/or that wemay suffer a decline in sales if our customers do not accept price increases. The United States, Mexico and Canadarecently signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (""USMCA""), the successor agreement to the North AmericanFree Trade Agreement (""NAFTA""). It is expected that the USMCA will become effective by January 1, 2021. The UnitedStates also recently signed a ""Phase 1"" trade agreement with China. It remains unclear what the U.S. administrationor foreign governments, including China, will or will not do with respect to tariffs, the USMCA or other international tradeagreements and policies. A trade war, other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements, changesin U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing,development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently manufacture and sell products or any resultingnegative sentiments towards the United States could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financialcondition, operating results and cash flows. 14  Substantially all of our import operationsare subject to customs and tax requirements as well as trade regulations, such as tariffs and quotas set by governments throughmutual agreements or bilateral actions. In addition, the countries in which our products are manufactured or imported may fromtime to time impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions.Adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions, or our suppliers' failure to comply with customs regulations or similarlaws, could harm our business. In this regard, possible changes in U.S. policies and the potential effects of Brexit have introducedgreater uncertainty with respect to future tax and trade regulations. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, such as the disallowanceof tax deductions on imported merchandise or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverseeffect on our business and results of operations. Our operations are also subject to theeffects of international trade agreements and regulations that impose requirements that could adversely affect our business, suchas setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country. These risks are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Form 10-K may includeadditional factors which could adversely impact the Company’s business and financial performance. Moreover, the Company operatesin a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for managementto predict all risk factors, nor can the Company assess the impact of all factors on business or the extent to which any factor,or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction ofactual results. "
2,ESCA,ESCALADE INC,2019-02-22,"ITEM 1A—RISK FACTORS Operating results may be impactedby changes in the economy that influence business and consumer spending. Operating resultsare directly impacted by the health of the North American and to a lesser extent, European and Asian economies. We cannot predicthow robust the economy will be or whether or not it will be sustained. If the economic recovery slows, or if the economy experiencesa prolonged period of decelerating or negative growth, the Company’s results of operations may be negatively impacted. Ingeneral, the Company’s sales depend on discretionary spending by consumers. Business and financial performance may be adverselyaffected by current and future economic conditions, including unemployment levels, energy costs, interest rates, recession, inflation,the impact of natural disasters and terrorist activities, and other matters that influence business and consumer spending. Fluctuationin economic conditions could prevent the Company from accurately forecasting demand for its products which could adversely affectits operating results or market share. Fluctuation ineconomic conditions and market instability in the United States and globally makes it difficult for the Company, customers andsuppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause the Company to produce excess products that canincrease inventory carrying costs and result in obsolete inventory. Alternatively, this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortageof products, or materials used in products, that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for products and a loss of marketshare. Markets are highly competitive whichcould limit the Company’s growth and reduce profitability. The market for sporting goods is highlyfragmented and intensely competitive. A majority of the Company’s products are in markets that are experiencing low growthrates. Escalade competes with a variety of regional, national and international manufacturers for customers, employees, products,services and other important aspects of the business. The Company has historically sold a large percentage of its sporting goodsproducts to mass merchandisers and has increasingly attempted to expand sales to specialty retailer and dealer markets and to on-lineretailers. In addition to competition for sales into those distribution channels, vendors also must compete in sporting goods withlarge format sporting goods stores, traditional sporting goods stores and chains, warehouse clubs, discount stores and departmentstores. Competition from on-line retailers may also impact sales. Some of the current and potential competitors are larger thanEscalade and have substantially greater financial resources that may be devoted to sourcing, promoting and selling their products,and may discount prices more heavily than the Company can afford.  5   If the Company is unable to predictor effectively react to changes in consumer demand, it may lose customers and sales may decline. Success dependsin part on the ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand and preferences regarding sportinggoods. Products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subjectto change. The Company often makes commitments to manufacture products months in advance of the proposed delivery to customers.If Escalade misjudges the market for products, sales may decline significantly. The Company may have to take significant inventorymarkdowns on unpopular products that are overproduced and/or miss opportunities for other products that may rise in popularity,both of which could have a negative impact on profitability. A major shift in consumer demand away from sporting goods productscould also have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company derives a substantialportion of its revenue from a few significant customers and loss of any of these customers could materially affect our resultsof operations and financial condition. The Company has two major customers, eachof which accounted for more than ten percent of consolidated gross sales and more than ten percent of total accounts receivable.The Company also has several other large customers, none of which represent more than ten percent of consolidated gross sales,and historically has derived substantial revenues from these customers. Our customers continue to experience industry consolidation,which increases our risk that we may be unable to find sufficient alternative customers. The Company needs to continue to expandits customer base to minimize the effects of the loss of any single customer in the future. If sales to one or more of the largecustomers would be lost or materially reduced, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to replace such revenues,which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s customers mayexperience financial difficulties that could result in losses to the Company. From time to time, one or more of the Company’scustomers have experienced, are experiencing, or may in the future experience financial difficulties that impair their abilityto pay all amounts owed to the Company. In such instances, the customer may file bankruptcy or take other actions to restructurethe amounts owed to secured and unsecured creditors, including unsecured trade creditors such as the Company. When this occurs,the Company may not be able to collect the full amount owed to it by the customer, and in severe situations may have to write offall or a substantial portion of those customer receivables. Any significant resulting losses incurred by the Company relating tothese or other customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operation, and financialcondition. Quarterly operating results are subjectto fluctuation. Operating resultshave fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, and the Company expects that they will continue to do so in the future. Factorsthat could cause these quarterly fluctuations include the following: international, national and local general economicand market conditions; the size and growth of the overall sporting goods markets; intense competition among manufacturers, marketers,distributors and sellers of products; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categoriesof products and sports; seasonal demand for products; adverse weather conditions that may create fluctuations in demand for certainof our products; the size, timing and mix of purchases of products; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results;ability to sustain, manage or forecast growth and inventories; new product development and introduction; ability to secure andprotect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; performance and reliability of products; customer service; the lossof significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors; business disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportationto meet delivery deadlines; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated with doing business outsidethe United States, including, without limitation: exchange rates, import duties, tariffs, quotas and political and economic instability;changes in government regulations; any liability and other claims asserted against the Company; ability to attract and retain qualifiedpersonnel; and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and any other filings with the Securitiesand Exchange Commission.  6   The Companymay pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures, or investments and the failure of a strategic transaction to produce anticipatedresults or the inability to fully integrate an acquired company could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business. The Company hasmade acquisitions of complementary companies or businesses, which have been part of the strategic plan, and may continue to pursueacquisitions in the future from time to time. Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, and mayresult in the diversion of capital and management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities. The Company maynot be able to successfully integrate operations that it acquires, including personnel, financial systems, distribution, and operatingprocedures. If the Company fails to successfully integrate acquisitions, the Company’s business could suffer. In addition,acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expense or write-offs of goodwill or otherintangibles, any of which could affect the Company’s financial position. The Company also has sometimes divested or discontinuedcertain operations, assets, and products that did not perform to the Company’s expectations or no longer fit with the Company’sstrategic objectives. Divestitures may result in gains, losses, contingent liabilities, write-offs, tax consequences, or otherrelated costs and expenses that could affect the Company’s financial position. Escalade will consider acquisitions, divestitures,and investments in the future, one or more of which, individually or in the aggregate, could be material to the Company’soverall business, operations or financial position. Growth may strain resources, whichcould adversely affect the Company’s business and financial performance. The Company has grown in the past throughstrategic acquisitions, and continues to make acquisitions in its Sporting Goods business. Our growth strategy also depends onour ability to grow our e-commerce business. Growth places additional demands on management and operational systems. If the Companyis not successful in continuing to support operational and financial systems, expanding the management team and increasing andeffectively managing customers and suppliers, growth may result in operational inefficiencies and ineffective management of theCompany’s business, which could adversely affect its business and financial performance. The Company’sability to operate and expand business and to respond to changing business and economic conditions will be dependent upon the availabilityof adequate capital. The rate of expansionwill also depend on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn will depend in large part on cash flow generated by thebusiness and the availability of equity and debt capital. The Company can make no assurances that it will be able to obtain equityor debt capital on acceptable terms or at all. Our current senior secured revolving credit facility contains provisions that limitour ability to incur additional indebtedness or make substantial asset sales, which might otherwise be used to finance our operations.In the event of our insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, the lenders under our senior secured revolving creditfacility would be entitled to payment in full from our assets before distributions, if any, to our stockholders. The Companycould suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled management and key personnel. The Company’ssuccess depends in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified management executives and key personnel. Significantcompetition for qualified candidates exists in the Company’s business lines and geographic locations. If the Company is notable to hire and retain its executives and key personnel, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain such individualsbecomes more expensive, the Company may suffer adverse consequences to its business, operations, and financial condition.  7   The Company’s business maybe adversely affected by the actions of and risks associated with third-party suppliers. The raw materials that the Company purchasesfor manufacturing operations and many of the products that it sells are sourced from a wide variety of third-party suppliers. TheCompany cannot control the supply, design, function or cost of many of the products that are offered for sale and are dependenton the availability and pricing of key materials and products. Disruptions in the availability of raw materials used in productionof these products may adversely affect sales and result in customer dissatisfaction. In addition, global sourcing of many of theproducts sold is an important factor in the Company’s financial performance. The ability to find qualified suppliers andto access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced outsidethe United States. Political instability, financial instability of suppliers, merchandise quality issues, trade restrictions, tariffs,currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, inflation and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond the Company’scontrol. Historically,instability in the political and economic environments of the countries in which the Company or its suppliers obtain products andraw materials has not had a material adverse effect on operations. However, the Company cannot predict the effect that future changesin economic or political conditions in the United States and in such foreign countries may have on operations. In the event ofdisruptions or delays in supply due to economic or political conditions, such disruptions or delays could adversely affect resultsof operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements could be made. In addition, products and materials purchased fromalternative sources may be of lesser quality or more expensive than the products and materials currently purchased abroad. Deteriorationin relationships with suppliers or in the financial condition of suppliers could adversely affect liquidity, results of operationsand financial position. Access to materials,parts and supplies is dependent upon close relationships with suppliers and the ability to purchase products from the principalsuppliers on competitive terms. The Company does not enter into long-term supply contracts with these suppliers, and has no currentplans to do so in the future. These suppliers are not required to sell to the Company and are free to change the prices and otherterms. Any deterioration or change in the relationships with or in the financial condition of the Company’s significant supplierscould have an adverse impact on its ability to procure materials and parts necessary to produce products for sale and distribution.If any of the significant suppliers terminated or significantly curtailed its relationship with the Company or ceased operations,the Company would be forced to expand relationships with other suppliers, seek out new relationships with new suppliers or riska loss in market share due to diminished product offerings and availability. Any change in one or more of these suppliers’willingness or ability to continue to supply the Company with their products could have an adverse impact on the Company’sliquidity, results of operations and financial position. Disruptionsto our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our operations. Many of the Company’sproducts are manufactured outside the United States. Those products must be transported by third parties over large geographicdistances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products could occur due to work stoppages, port strikes, lack of availabilityof transportation, and other factors beyond the Company’s control. Such delays could impair our ability to timely and efficientlydeliver our products, and could adversely impact our operating results.  8   The Company may be subject to productwarranty claims that require the replacement or repair of the product sold. Such warranty claims could adversely affect the Company’sfinancial position and relationships with its customers. The Company manufactures and/or distributesa variety of products. From time to time, such products may contain manufacturing defects or design flaws that are not detectedprior to sale, particularly as to new product introductions or upon design changes to existing products. The failure to identifyand correct manufacturing defects and product design issues prior to the sale of those products could result in product warrantyclaims that result in costs to replace or repair any such defective products. Because many of the Company’s products aresold to retailers for broad consumer distribution and/or to customers who buy in large quantities, the costs associated with productwarranty claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial position. Productwarranty claims also could cause customer dissatisfaction that may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s reputationand on the Company’s relationships with its customers, which may result in lost or reduced sales. The Company may be subject to varioustypes of litigation and the Company’s insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages related to those claims. From time to timethe Company or its subsidiaries may be involved in lawsuits or other claims arising in the course of business, including thoserelated to product liability, consumer protection, employment, intellectual property, torts and other matters. In addition, itmay be subject to lawsuits relating to the design, manufacture or distribution of its products. The Company may be subject to lawsuitsresulting from injuries associated with the use of sporting goods equipment that it sells and information security and print finishingproducts that it sold prior to divesting that business. The Company may incur losses relating to these claims or the defense ofthese claims. There is a risk that claims or liabilities will exceed the Company’s insurance coverage. In addition, the Companymay be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future. Further, the Company is subject to regulation by the ConsumerProduct Safety Commission and similar state regulatory agencies. If the Company fails to comply with government and industry safetystandards, it may be subject to claims, lawsuits, fines, product recalls and adverse publicity that could have a material adverseeffect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Intellectual property rights arevaluable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of products. The Company obtainspatents, trademarks and copyrights for intellectual property, which represent important assets to the Company. If the Company failsto adequately protect intellectual property through patents, trademarks and copyrights, its intellectual property rights may bemisappropriated by others, invalidated or challenged, and our competitors could duplicate the Company’s products or may otherwiselimit any competitive design or manufacturing advantages. The Company believes that success is likely to depend upon continuedinnovation, technical expertise, marketing skills and customer support and services rather than on legal protection of intellectualproperty rights. However, the Company intends to aggressively assert its intellectual property rights when necessary. The expiration or termination ofour material trademarks, brand names and licensing agreements could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company hasinvested substantial resources in developing and marketing the Company’s brands and products over many years. The expirationor termination of one or more of the Company’s material trademarks, patents or licensing agreements could result in the lossof such intellectual property. In such event, the Company may not be able to recoup its investments in, and continue to benefitfrom the affected brand names or products. The loss of such intellectual property and related rights could have a material adverseeffect on the Company.  9   The Companyis subject to risks associated with laws and regulations related to health, safety and environmental protection. Products, andthe production and distribution of products, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmentalprotection. Laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmental protection have been passed in several jurisdictionsin which the Company operates in the United States and abroad. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effectsbased on the nature of operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will nothave a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. International operations expose theCompany to the unique risks inherent in foreign operations. The Company has operations in Mexico. Foreignoperations encounter risks similar to those faced by U.S. operations, as well as risks inherent in foreign operations, such aslocal customs and regulatory constraints, control over product quality and content, foreign trade policies, competitive conditions,foreign currency fluctuations and unstable political and economic conditions. The Company’s business relationships in Asiafurther increase its exposure to these foreign operating risks, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s incomeand profitability. The Company could be adversely affectedby changes in currency exchange rates and/or the value of the United States dollar. The Company is exposed to risks relatedto the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the value of the United States dollar. Changes in currency exchangerates and the value of the United States dollar can have a significant impact on earnings. While the Company carefully watchesfluctuations in currency exchange rates, these types of changes can have material adverse effects on the Company’s business,results of operations and financial condition. Failure to improve and maintain thequality of internal controls over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the ability to provide timely and accuratefinancial information, which could harm the Company’s reputation and share price. Management is responsible for establishingand maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting for the Company to provide reasonable assurance regarding thereliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accountingprinciples. Management cannot be certain that weaknesses and deficiencies in internal controls will not arise or be identifiedor that the Company will be able to correct and maintain adequate controls over financial processes and reporting in the future.Any failure to maintain adequate controls or to adequately implement required new or improved controls could harm operating resultsor cause failure to meet reporting obligations in a timely and accurate manner. Ineffective internal controls over financial reportingcould also cause investors to lose confidence in reported financial information, which could adversely affect the trading priceof the Company’s common stock. Disclosure controls and procedures aredesigned to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, management, including the Chief Executive Officerand Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A controlsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives ofthe control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems,no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.  10   Problems with the Company’sinformation system software or hardware could disrupt operations and negatively impact financial results and materially adverselyaffect the Company’s business operations. The Company relies on a suite of applicationsand third party software to receive and process customer orders and for the core of its manufacturing, distribution, and accountingsystems. These systems, if not functioning properly, could disrupt its operations, including the Company’s ability to receiveand ship orders and to process financial information or engage in similar normal business activities. Any material disruption,malfunction, cyber-attack or other similar problems in or with these systems could negatively impact our financial results andmaterially adversely affect our business operations. Breaches of data or technology securitycould damage the Company’s reputation, cause the Company to incur additional expense, expose the Company to litigation, andadversely affect the Company’s business. A breach of our data or technology securitycould result in an unauthorized transfer or release of Company proprietary, employee, customer and other Company related information,or the loss of valuable business data or technology, that could cause a disruption in our business. Hackers are increasingly sophisticatedand operate large scale and complex cyber security attacks. In the event of such an attack, we may expend significant capital andother resources to protect against, respond to, and/or alleviate problems caused by a breach. Such an event could also result inunwanted negative media attention, damage to the Company’s reputation, damage to our customers, and result in lost salesand lawsuits. The Company also must comply with increasingly complex regulatory cyber security and privacy standards, which canbe costly and negatively impact the Company’s profitability. The preparation of the Company’sfinancial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results. The preparation of consolidated financialstatements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make significantestimates that may affect financial statements. Due to the inherent nature of making estimates, actual results may vary substantiallyfrom such estimates, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financialcondition. For more information on the Company’s critical accounting estimates, please see the Critical Accounting Estimatessection of this Form 10-K. Changes in accounting standards couldimpact reported earnings and financial condition. The accounting standard setters, includingthe Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, periodically change the financial accountingand reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. These changes canbe hard to predict and apply and can materially affect how the Company records and reports its financial condition and resultsof operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, which may resultin the restatement of prior period financial statements.  11   The Company’s effective tax ratemay fluctuate. The Company is a multi-channel providerof sporting goods. As a result, the Company’s effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates inthe various countries, states and other jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In addition to the effects of the 2017 U.S.Tax Reforms, the effective tax rate may be lower or higher than its tax rates have been in the past due to numerous factors, includingthe sources of income, any agreement with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, the tax filing positions taken in variousjurisdictions and changes in the political environment in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The Company bases estimatesof an effective tax rate at any given point in time upon a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to the Company and to estimatesof the amount of business likely to be done in any given jurisdiction. The loss of one or more agreements with taxing jurisdictions,a change in the mix of business from year to year and from country to country, changes in rules related to accounting for incometaxes, changes in tax laws and any of the multiple jurisdictions in which the Company operates, or adverse outcomes from tax auditsthat the Company may be subject to in any of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, could result in an unfavorable changein the effective tax rate which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The market price of the Company’scommon stock is likely to be highly volatile as the stock market in general can be highly volatile. The public trading of the Company’scommon stock is based on many factors which could cause fluctuation in the Company’s stock price. These factors may include,among other things: ·General economic and marketconditions;·Actual or anticipated variationsin quarterly operating results;·Limited research coverageby securities analysts;·Relatively low market capitalizationresulting in low trading volume in the Company’s stock;·If securities analysts providecoverage, our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts' estimates or expectations;·Conditions or trends inthe Company’s industries;·Changes in the market valuationsof other companies in the Company’s industries;·Announcements by the Companyor the Company’s competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategicinitiatives;·Capital commitments;·Additions or departuresof key personnel;·Sales and repurchases ofthe Company’s common stock; and·The ability to maintainlisting of the Company’s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market. Many of thesefactors are beyond the Company’s control. These factors may cause the market price of the Company’s common stock todecline, regardless of operating performance. If we are unable to pay quarterlydividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed. Our quarterly cash dividend is currently$0.125 per common share. The dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. Our ability to pay dividends willdepend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic,financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our Board of Directors (Board) may, at its discretion, increaseor decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Any failure to pay dividendsafter we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impactour stock price.  12   Unauthorizeddisclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information could harm the Company’s business and its standing with itscustomers. Through sales and marketing activities,the Company collects and stores certain information that customers provide to purchase products or services or otherwise communicateand interact with the Company. Despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, the Company cannot be certainthat all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate the Company’snetwork security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer or business information. In addition, an employee, acontractor or other third party with whom the Company does business may attempt to circumvent the Company’s security measuresin order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Loss of customer or business informationcould disrupt operations, damage the Company’s reputation, and expose the Company to claims from customers, financial institutions,payment card associations and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, resultsof operations and financial condition. In addition, compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standardsmay result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. Terroristattacks, acts of war or natural disaster may seriously harm the Company’s business. Among the chiefuncertainties facing the nation and the world and, as a result, our business, is the instability and conflict in the Middle Eastand uncertainties regarding North Korea, Russia, China and other Asian and European countries. Obviously, no one can predict withcertainty what the overall economic impact will be as a result of these circumstances. Terrorist attacks may cause damage or disruptionto the Company, employees, facilities and customers, which could significantly impact net sales, costs and expenses and financialcondition. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and international responses to terrorist attacks, and otheracts of war and hostility may cause greater uncertainty and cause business to suffer in ways the Company currently cannot predict. In addition, anynatural disaster or other serious disruption to one of the Company’s manufacturing or distribution sights due to fire, tornado,earthquake or any other causes could damage a material portion of inventory or impair our ability to provide product to our customersand could negatively affect our sales and profitability. New laws, policies, regulations,rulemaking and oversight, as well as changes to those currently in effect, could adversely impact our earnings, cash flows andoperations. Our assets and operations are subject toregulation and oversight by federal, state, and local regulatory authorities. Legislative changes, as well as regulatory actionstaken by these agencies, have the potential to adversely affect our profitability. In addition, a certain degree of regulatoryuncertainty is created by the U.S. political climate. It remains unclear specifically what the current presidential administrationand Congress may do with respect to future policies and regulations that may affect us. Regulation affects many aspects of ourbusiness and extends to such matters as (i) federal, state, and local taxation; (ii) rates (which include tax, commodity, surchargesand fuel); (iii) the integrity, safety and security of facilities and operations; (iv) the acquisition of other businesses; (v)the acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of services or facilities; (vi) reporting and information requirements;and (vii) the maintenance of accounts and records. Failure to sustain a continuing economicrecovery in the United States and elsewhere could have a substantial adverse effect on our business. Our business is tied to general economicand industry conditions as demand for sporting goods depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumerconfidence levels and the availability and cost of credit. These factors have had and could continue to have a substantial impacton our business.  13   Certain political developments in recentyears have provided increased economic uncertainty. The United Kingdom's decision to exit the European Union and political conflictsin the U.S. both could result in economic and trade policy actions that would impact economic conditions in various countries,the cost of importing into the U.S. and the competitive landscape of our customers, suppliers and competitors. Adverse global economic conditions couldalso cause our customers and suppliers to experience severe economic constraints in the future, including bankruptcy, which couldhave a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. Our business is subject to risksassociated with sourcing and manufacturing overseas. We import both rawmaterials and finished goods into our operating facilities. Our ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective mannermay be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port andshipping capacity, labor disputes and work stoppages, political unrest, severe weather, or security requirements in the UnitedStates and other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require us to locate alternative ports or warehousingproviders to avoid disruption to our customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in highertransportation costs, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition, specifically our gross marginand overall profitability. Substantially all of our import operationsare subject to customs and tax requirements as well as trade regulations, such as tariffs and quotas set by governments throughmutual agreements or bilateral actions. In addition, the countries in which our products are manufactured or imported may fromtime to time impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions.Adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions, or our suppliers' failure to comply with customs regulations or similarlaws, could harm our business. In this regard, possible changes in U.S. policies and the potential effects of Brexit have introducedgreater uncertainty with respect to future tax and trade regulations. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, such as the disallowanceof tax deductions on imported merchandise or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverseeffect on our business and results of operations. Our operations are also subject to theeffects of international trade agreements and regulations that impose requirements that could adversely affect our business, suchas setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country. These risks are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Form 10-K may includeadditional factors which could adversely impact the Company’s business and financial performance. Moreover, the Company operatesin a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for managementto predict all risk factors, nor can the Company assess the impact of all factors on business or the extent to which any factor,or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction ofactual results. "
14,ESCA,ESCALADE INC,2018-02-27,"ITEM 1A— RISK FACTORS Operating results may be impacted bychanges in the economy that influence business and consumer spending. Operating resultsare directly impacted by the health of the North American and to a lesser extent, European and Asian economies. We cannot predicthow robust the economy will be or whether or not it will be sustained. If the economic recovery slows, or if the economy experiencesa prolonged period of decelerating or negative growth, the Company’s results of operations may be negatively impacted. Ingeneral, the Company’s sales depend on discretionary spending by consumers. Business and financial performance may be adverselyaffected by current and future economic conditions, including unemployment levels, energy costs, interest rates, recession, inflation,the impact of natural disasters and terrorist activities, and other matters that influence business and consumer spending. Fluctuationin economic conditions could prevent the Company from accurately forecasting demand for its products which could adversely affectits operating results or market share. Fluctuation in economicconditions and market instability in the United States and globally makes it difficult for the Company, customers and suppliersto accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause the Company to produce excess products that can increaseinventory carrying costs and result in obsolete inventory. Alternatively, this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortage ofproducts, or materials used in products, that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for products and a loss of marketshare. Markets are highly competitive whichcould limit the Company’s growth and reduce profitability. The market for sporting goods is highly fragmentedand intensely competitive. A majority of the Company’s products are in markets that are experiencing low growth rates. Escaladecompetes with a variety of regional, national and international manufacturers for customers, employees, products, services andother important aspects of the business. The Company has historically sold a large percentage of its sporting goods products tomass merchandisers and has increasingly attempted to expand sales to specialty retailer and dealer markets and to on-line retailers.In addition to competition for sales into those distribution channels, vendors also must compete in sporting goods with large formatsporting goods stores, traditional sporting goods stores and chains, warehouse clubs, discount stores and department stores. Competitionfrom on-line retailers may also impact sales. Some of the current and potential competitors are larger than Escalade and have substantiallygreater financial resources that may be devoted to sourcing, promoting and selling their products, and may discount prices moreheavily than the Company can afford.  5    If the Company is unable to predict or effectivelyreact to changes in consumer demand, it may lose customers and sales may decline. Success depends inpart on the ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand and preferences regarding sportinggoods. Products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subjectto change. The Company often makes commitments to manufacture products months in advance of the proposed delivery to customers.If Escalade misjudges the market for products, sales may decline significantly. The Company may have to take significant inventorymarkdowns on unpopular products that are overproduced and/or miss opportunities for other products that may rise in popularity,both of which could have a negative impact on profitability. A major shift in consumer demand away from sporting goods productscould also have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company derives a substantial portionof its revenue from a few significant customers and loss of any of these customers could materially affect our results of operationsand financial condition. The Company has two major customers, each ofwhich accounted for more than ten percent of consolidated gross sales and more than ten percent of total accounts receivable. TheCompany also has several other large customers, none of which represent more than ten percent of consolidated gross sales, andhistorically has derived substantial revenues from these customers. Our customers continue to experience industry consolidation,which increases our risk that we may be unable to find sufficient alternative customers. The Company needs to continue to expandits customer base to minimize the effects of the loss of any single customer in the future. If sales to one or more of the largecustomers would be lost or materially reduced, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to replace such revenues,which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s customers may experiencefinancial difficulties that could result in losses to the Company. From time to time, one or more of the Company’scustomers have experienced, are experiencing, or may in the future experience financial difficulties that impair their abilityto pay all amounts owed to the Company. In such instances, the customer may file bankruptcy or take other actions to restructurethe amounts owed to secured and unsecured creditors, including unsecured trade creditors such as the Company. When this occurs,the Company may not be able to collect the full amount owed to it by the customer, and in severe situations may have to write offall or a substantial portion of those customer receivables. Any significant resulting losses incurred by the Company relating tothese or other customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operation, and financialcondition. Quarterly operating results are subjectto fluctuation. Operating resultshave fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, and the Company expects that they will continue to do so in the future. Factorsthat could cause these quarterly fluctuations include the following: international, national and local general economicand market conditions; the size and growth of the overall sporting goods markets; intense competition among manufacturers, marketers,distributors and sellers of products; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categoriesof products and sports; seasonal demand for products; the size, timing and mix of purchases of products; fluctuations and difficultyin forecasting operating results; ability to sustain, manage or forecast growth and inventories; new product development and introduction;ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; performance and reliability of products; customerservice; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors; business disruptions; increased costs of freightand transportation to meet delivery deadlines; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated withdoing business outside the United States, including, without limitation: exchange rates, import duties, tariffs, quotas and politicaland economic instability; changes in government regulations; any liability and other claims asserted against the Company; abilityto attract and retain qualified personnel; and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and anyother filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  6    The Companymay pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures, or investments and the failure of a strategic transaction to produce anticipatedresults or the inability to fully integrate an acquired company could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business. The Company has madeacquisitions of complementary companies or businesses, which have been part of the strategic plan, and may continue to pursue acquisitionsin the future from time to time. Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, and may result inthe diversion of capital and management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities. The Company may not beable to successfully integrate operations that it acquires, including personnel, financial systems, distribution, and operatingprocedures. If the Company fails to successfully integrate acquisitions, the Company’s business could suffer. In addition,acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expense or write-offs of goodwill or otherintangibles, any of which could affect the Company’s financial position. The Company also has sometimes divested or discontinuedcertain operations, assets, and products that did not perform to the Company’s expectations or no longer fit with the Company’sstrategic objectives. Divestitures may result in gains, losses, contingent liabilities, write-offs, tax consequences, or otherrelated costs and expenses that could affect the Company’s financial position. Escalade will consider acquisitions, divestitures,and investments in the future, one or more of which, individually or in the aggregate, could be material to the Company’soverall business, operations or financial position. Growth may strain resources, which couldadversely affect the Company’s business and financial performance. The Company has grown in the past through strategicacquisitions, and continues to make acquisitions in its Sporting Goods business. Our growth strategy also depends on our abilityto grow our e-commerce business. Growth places additional demands on management and operational systems. If the Company is notsuccessful in continuing to support operational and financial systems, expanding the management team and increasing and effectivelymanaging customers and suppliers, growth may result in operational inefficiencies and ineffective management of the Company’sbusiness, which could adversely affect its business and financial performance. The Company’sability to operate and expand business and to respond to changing business and economic conditions will be dependent upon the availabilityof adequate capital. The rate of expansionwill also depend on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn will depend in large part on cash flow generated by thebusiness and the availability of equity and debt capital. The Company can make no assurances that it will be able to obtain equityor debt capital on acceptable terms or at all. Our current senior secured revolving credit facility contains provisions that limitour ability to incur additional indebtedness or make substantial asset sales, which might otherwise be used to finance our operations.In the event of our insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, the lenders under our senior secured revolving creditfacility would be entitled to payment in full from our assets before distributions, if any, to our stockholders.  7    The Companycould suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled management and key personnel. The Company’ssuccess depends in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified management executives and key personnel. Significantcompetition for qualified candidates exists in the Company’s business lines and geographic locations. If the Company is notable to hire and retain its executives and key personnel, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain such individualsbecomes more expensive, the Company may suffer adverse consequences to its business, operations, and financial condition. The Company’s business may be adverselyaffected by the actions of and risks associated with third-party suppliers. The raw materials that the Company purchasesfor manufacturing operations and many of the products that it sells are sourced from a wide variety of third-party suppliers. TheCompany cannot control the supply, design, function or cost of many of the products that are offered for sale and are dependenton the availability and pricing of key materials and products. Disruptions in the availability of raw materials used in productionof these products may adversely affect sales and result in customer dissatisfaction. In addition, global sourcing of many of theproducts sold is an important factor in the Company’s financial performance. The ability to find qualified suppliers andto access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced outsidethe United States. Political instability, financial instability of suppliers, merchandise quality issues, trade restrictions, tariffs,currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, inflation and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond the Company’scontrol. Historically, instabilityin the political and economic environments of the countries in which the Company or its suppliers obtain products and raw materialshas not had a material adverse effect on operations. However, the Company cannot predict the effect that future changes in economicor political conditions in the United States and in such foreign countries may have on operations. In the event of disruptionsor delays in supply due to economic or political conditions, such disruptions or delays could adversely affect results of operationsunless and until alternative supply arrangements could be made. In addition, products and materials purchased from alternativesources may be of lesser quality or more expensive than the products and materials currently purchased abroad. Deteriorationin relationships with suppliers or in the financial condition of suppliers could adversely affect liquidity, results of operationsand financial position. Access to materials,parts and supplies is dependent upon close relationships with suppliers and the ability to purchase products from the principalsuppliers on competitive terms. The Company does not enter into long-term supply contracts with these suppliers, and has no currentplans to do so in the future. These suppliers are not required to sell to the Company and are free to change the prices and otherterms. Any deterioration or change in the relationships with or in the financial condition of the Company’s significant supplierscould have an adverse impact on its ability to procure materials and parts necessary to produce products for sale and distribution.If any of the significant suppliers terminated or significantly curtailed its relationship with the Company or ceased operations,the Company would be forced to expand relationships with other suppliers, seek out new relationships with new suppliers or riska loss in market share due to diminished product offerings and availability. Any change in one or more of these suppliers’willingness or ability to continue to supply the Company with their products could have an adverse impact on the Company’sliquidity, results of operations and financial position. Disruptionsto our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our operations. Many of the Company’sproducts are manufactured outside the United States. Those products must be transported by third parties over large geographicdistances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products could occur due to work stoppages, port strikes, lack of availabilityof transportation, and other factors beyond the Company’s control. Such delays could impair our ability to timely and efficientlydeliver our products, and could adversely impact our operating results.  8    The Company may be subject to productwarranty claims that require the replacement or repair of the product sold. Such warranty claims could adversely affect the Company’sfinancial position and relationships with its customers. The Company manufactures and/or distributesa variety of products. From time to time, such products may contain manufacturing defects or design flaws that are not detectedprior to sale, particularly as to new product introductions or upon design changes to existing products. The failure to identifyand correct manufacturing defects and product design issues prior to the sale of those products could result in product warrantyclaims that result in costs to replace or repair any such defective products. Because many of the Company’s products aresold to retailers for broad consumer distribution and/or to customers who buy in large quantities, the costs associated with productwarranty claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial position. Productwarranty claims also could cause customer dissatisfaction that may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s reputationand on the Company’s relationships with its customers, which may result in lost or reduced sales. The Company may be subject to various typesof litigation and the Company’s insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages related to those claims. From time to timethe Company or its subsidiaries may be involved in lawsuits or other claims arising in the course of business, including thoserelated to product liability, consumer protection, employment, intellectual property, torts and other matters. In addition, itmay be subject to lawsuits relating to the design, manufacture or distribution of its products. The Company may be subject to lawsuitsresulting from injuries associated with the use of sporting goods equipment that it sells and information security and print finishingproducts that it sold prior to divesting that business. The Company may incur losses relating to these claims or the defense ofthese claims. There is a risk that claims or liabilities will exceed the Company’s insurance coverage. In addition, the Companymay be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future. Further, the Company is subject to regulation by the ConsumerProduct Safety Commission and similar state regulatory agencies. If the Company fails to comply with government and industry safetystandards, it may be subject to claims, lawsuits, fines, product recalls and adverse publicity that could have a material adverseeffect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Intellectual property rights are valuable,and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of products. The Company obtainspatents, trademarks and copyrights for intellectual property, which represent important assets to the Company. If the Company failsto adequately protect intellectual property through patents, trademarks and copyrights, its intellectual property rights may bemisappropriated by others, invalidated or challenged, and our competitors could duplicate the Company’s products or may otherwiselimit any competitive design or manufacturing advantages. The Company believes that success is likely to depend upon continuedinnovation, technical expertise, marketing skills and customer support and services rather than on legal protection of intellectualproperty rights. However, the Company intends to aggressively assert its intellectual property rights when necessary. The expiration or termination of ourmaterial trademarks, brand names and licensing agreements could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company has investedsubstantial resources in developing and marketing the Company’s brands and products over many years. The expiration or terminationof one or more of the Company’s material trademarks, patents or licensing agreements could result in the loss of such intellectualproperty. In such event, the Company may not be able to recoup its investments in, and continue to benefit from the affected brandnames or products. The loss of such intellectual property and related rights could have a material adverse effect on the Company.  9    The Companyis subject to risks associated with laws and regulations related to health, safety and environmental protection. Products, and theproduction and distribution of products, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmentalprotection. Laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmental protection have been passed in several jurisdictionsin which the Company operates in the United States and abroad. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effectsbased on the nature of operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will nothave a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. International operations expose the Companyto the unique risks inherent in foreign operations. The Company has operations in Mexico. Foreignoperations encounter risks similar to those faced by U.S. operations, as well as risks inherent in foreign operations, such aslocal customs and regulatory constraints, control over product quality and content, foreign trade policies, competitive conditions,foreign currency fluctuations and unstable political and economic conditions. The Company’s business relationships in Asiaand joint venture in Sweden further increase its exposure to these foreign operating risks, which could have an adverse impacton the Company’s income and profitability. The Company could be adversely affectedby changes in currency exchange rates and/or the value of the United States dollar. The Company is exposed to risks related tothe effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the value of the United States dollar. Changes in currency exchangerates and the value of the United States dollar can have a significant impact on earnings. While the Company carefully watchesfluctuations in currency exchange rates, these types of changes can have material adverse effects on the Company’s business,results of operations and financial condition. Failure to improve and maintain the qualityof internal controls over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the ability to provide timely and accuratefinancial information, which could harm the Company’s reputation and share price. Management is responsible for establishingand maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting for the Company to provide reasonable assurance regarding thereliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accountingprinciples. Management cannot be certain that weaknesses and deficiencies in internal controls will not arise or be identifiedor that the Company will be able to correct and maintain adequate controls over financial processes and reporting in the future.Any failure to maintain adequate controls or to adequately implement required new or improved controls could harm operating resultsor cause failure to meet reporting obligations in a timely and accurate manner. Ineffective internal controls over financial reportingcould also cause investors to lose confidence in reported financial information, which could adversely affect the trading priceof the Company’s common stock. Disclosure controls and procedures are designedto provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, management, including the Chief Executive Officer and ChiefFinancial Officer, does not expect that disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system,no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the controlsystem are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefitsof controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation ofcontrols can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.  10    Problems with the Company’s informationsystem software or hardware could disrupt operations and negatively impact financial results and materially adversely affect theCompany’s business operations.  The Company relies on a suite of applicationsand third party software to receive and process customer orders and for the core of its manufacturing, distribution, and accountingsystems. These systems, if not functioning properly, could disrupt its operations, including the Company’s ability to receiveand ship orders and to process financial information or engage in similar normal business activities. Any material disruption,malfunction, cyber-attack or other similar problems in or with these systems could negatively impact our financial results andmaterially adversely affect our business operations. Breaches of data or technology securitycould damage the Company’s reputation, cause the Company to incur additional expense, expose the Company to litigation, andadversely affect the Company’s business.  A breach of our data or technology securitycould result in an unauthorized transfer or release of Company proprietary, employee, customer and other Company related information,or the loss of valuable business data or technology, that could cause a disruption in our business. Hackers are increasingly sophisticatedand operate large scale and complex cyber security attacks. In the event of such an attack, we may expend significant capital andother resources to protect against, respond to, and/or alleviate problems caused by a breach. Such an event could also result inunwanted negative media attention, damage to the Company’s reputation, damage to our customers, and result in lost salesand lawsuits. The Company also must comply with increasingly complex regulatory cyber security and privacy standards, which canbe costly and negatively impact the Company’s profitability. The preparation of the Company’sfinancial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results. The preparation of consolidated financial statementsin conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make significant estimatesthat may affect financial statements. Due to the inherent nature of making estimates, actual results may vary substantially fromsuch estimates, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.For more information on the Company’s critical accounting estimates, please see the Critical Accounting Estimates sectionof this Form 10-K. Changes in accounting standards couldimpact reported earnings and financial condition. The accounting standard setters, includingthe Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, periodically change the financial accountingand reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. These changes canbe hard to predict and apply and can materially affect how the Company records and reports its financial condition and resultsof operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, which may resultin the restatement of prior period financial statements.  11    The potential effects of the 2017 U.S.tax reform legislation, as well as possible future tax law changes, on the Company are uncertain and could adversely impact theCompany’s business operations or otherwise adversely affect the Company.  On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and JobsAct of 2017 (the “2017 U.S. Tax Reforms”) was signed into law. The 2017 U.S. Tax Reforms significantly change the U.S.federal income taxation of U.S. businesses and their owners. Many of the changes included in the 2017 U.S. Tax Reforms are effectiveimmediately, without transition periods or grandfathering provisions. The details of the 2017 U.S. Tax Reforms may be unclear invarious respects and could be subject to amendments, technical corrections, IRS interpretations, implementing rules and regulations,and litigation, any of which could increase or lessen the impact of such tax law changes. While some of the changes made in the2017 U.S. Tax Reforms appear to benefit the Company in 2017 and future years, other changes may be adverse on a going forward basis.The Company intends to work with its tax and other advisors to determine the full impact that the U.S. 2017 Tax Reforms may haveon the Company and to utilize the potential benefits that may be applicable to the Company, but there can be no assurances thatthe Company will be successful in doing so or that potential negative consequences might not outweigh the benefits. The Company’s effective tax rate mayfluctuate. The Company is a multi-channel provider ofsporting goods. As a result, the Company’s effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in thevarious countries, states and other jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In addition to the effects of the 2017 U.S. TaxReforms, the effective tax rate may be lower or higher than its tax rates have been in the past due to numerous factors, includingthe sources of income, any agreement with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, the tax filing positions taken in variousjurisdictions and changes in the political environment in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The Company bases estimatesof an effective tax rate at any given point in time upon a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to the Company and to estimatesof the amount of business likely to be done in any given jurisdiction. The loss of one or more agreements with taxing jurisdictions,a change in the mix of business from year to year and from country to country, changes in rules related to accounting for incometaxes, changes in tax laws and any of the multiple jurisdictions in which the Company operates, or adverse outcomes from tax auditsthat the Company may be subject to in any of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, could result in an unfavorable changein the effective tax rate which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The market price of the Company’scommon stock is likely to be highly volatile as the stock market in general can be highly volatile. The public trading of the Company’s commonstock is based on many factors which could cause fluctuation in the Company’s stock price. These factors may include, amongother things: ·General economic and marketconditions;·Actual or anticipated variationsin quarterly operating results;·Limited research coverageby securities analysts;·Relatively low market capitalizationresulting in low trading volume in the Company’s stock;·If securities analysts providecoverage, our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts' estimates or expectations;·Conditions or trends inthe Company’s industries;·Changes in the market valuationsof other companies in the Company’s industries;·Announcements by the Companyor the Company’s competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategicinitiatives;·Capital commitments;·Additions or departuresof key personnel; ·Sales and repurchases ofthe Company’s common stock; and·The ability to maintainlisting of the Company’s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market.  12    Many of these factorsare beyond the Company’s control. These factors may cause the market price of the Company’s common stock to decline,regardless of operating performance. If we are unable to pay quarterly dividendsat intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.  Our quarterly cash dividend is currently $0.115per common share. The dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. Our ability to pay dividends will dependon our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic,financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our Board of Directors (Board) may, at its discretion, increaseor decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Any failure to pay dividendsafter we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impactour stock price. Unauthorizeddisclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information could harm the Company’s business and its standing with itscustomers. Through sales and marketing activities, theCompany collects and stores certain information that customers provide to purchase products or services or otherwise communicateand interact with the Company. Despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, the Company cannot be certainthat all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate the Company’snetwork security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer or business information. In addition, an employee, acontractor or other third party with whom the Company does business may attempt to circumvent the Company’s security measuresin order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Loss of customer or business informationcould disrupt operations, damage the Company’s reputation, and expose the Company to claims from customers, financial institutions,payment card associations and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, resultsof operations and financial condition. In addition, compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standardsmay result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. Terrorist attacks,acts of war or natural disaster may seriously harm the Company’s business. Among the chief uncertaintiesfacing the nation and the world and, as a result, our business, is the instability and conflict in the Middle East and uncertaintiesregarding North Korea, Russia, China and other Asian and European countries. Obviously, no one can predict with certainty whatthe overall economic impact will be as a result of these circumstances. Terrorist attacks may cause damage or disruption to theCompany, employees, facilities and customers, which could significantly impact net sales, costs and expenses and financial condition.The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and international responses to terrorist attacks, and other acts of warand hostility may cause greater uncertainty and cause business to suffer in ways the Company currently cannot predict. In addition, any naturaldisaster or other serious disruption to one of the Company’s manufacturing or distribution sights due to fire, tornado, earthquakeor any other causes could damage a material portion of inventory or impair our ability to provide product to our customers andcould negatively affect our sales and profitability.  13    New laws, policies, regulations, rulemakingand oversight, as well as changes to those currently in effect, could adversely impact our earnings, cash flows and operations. Our assets and operations are subject to regulationand oversight by federal, state, and local regulatory authorities. Legislative changes, as well as regulatory actions taken bythese agencies, have the potential to adversely affect our profitability. In addition, a certain degree of regulatory uncertaintyis created by the U.S. political climate. It remains unclear specifically what the current presidential administration and Congressmay do with respect to future policies and regulations that may affect us. Regulation affects many aspects of our business andextends to such matters as (i) federal, state, and local taxation; (ii) rates (which include tax, commodity, surcharges and fuel);(iii) the integrity, safety and security of facilities and operations; (iv) the acquisition of other businesses; (v) the acquisition,extension, disposition or abandonment of services or facilities; (vi) reporting and information requirements; and (vii) the maintenanceof accounts and records. Failure to sustain a continuing economicrecovery in the United States and elsewhere could have a substantial adverse effect on our business. Our business is tied to general economic andindustry conditions as demand for sporting goods depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumer confidencelevels and the availability and cost of credit. These factors have had and could continue to have a substantial impact on our business. Certain political developments in recent yearshave provided increased economic uncertainty. The United Kingdom's decision to exit the European Union and political conflictsin the U.S. both could result in economic and trade policy actions that would impact economic conditions in various countries,the cost of importing into the U.S. and the competitive landscape of our customers, suppliers and competitors. Adverse global economic conditions could alsocause our customers and suppliers to experience severe economic constraints in the future, including bankruptcy, which could havea material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. Our business is subject to risks associatedwith sourcing and manufacturing overseas. We import both raw materials and finished goodsinto our operating facilities. Our ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may be affected by conditionsat ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputesand work stoppages, political unrest, severe weather, or security requirements in the United States and other countries. Theseissues could delay importation of products or require us to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruptionto our customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transportation costs, whichcould have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition, specifically our gross margin and overall profitability. Substantially all of our import operationsare subject to customs and tax requirements as well as trade regulations, such as tariffs and quotas set by governments throughmutual agreements or bilateral actions. In addition, the countries in which our products are manufactured or imported may fromtime to time impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions.Adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions, or our suppliers' failure to comply with customs regulations or similarlaws, could harm our business. In this regard, possible changes in U.S. policies and the potential effects of Brexit have introducedgreater uncertainty with respect to future tax and trade regulations. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, such as the disallowanceof tax deductions on imported merchandise or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverseeffect on our business and results of operations.  14    Our operations are also subject to the effectsof international trade agreements and regulations that impose requirements that could adversely affect our business, such as settingquotas on products that may be imported from a particular country. These risks are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Form 10-K may includeadditional factors which could adversely impact the Company’s business and financial performance. Moreover, the Company operatesin a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for managementto predict all risk factors, nor can the Company assess the impact of all factors on business or the extent to which any factor,or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction ofactual results. "
7,ESCA,ESCALADE INC,2017-02-28,"ITEM 1A —RISK FACTORS Operating results may be impacted bychanges in the economy that influence business and consumer spending. Operating resultsare directly impacted by the health of the North American and to a lesser extent, European and Asian economies. We cannot predicthow robust the economy will be or whether or not it will be sustained. If the economic recovery slows, or if the economy experiencesa prolonged period of decelerating or negative growth, the Company’s results of operations may be negatively impacted. Ingeneral, the Company’s sales depend on discretionary spending by consumers. Business and financial performance may be adverselyaffected by current and future economic conditions, including unemployment levels, energy costs, interest rates, recession, inflation,the impact of natural disasters and terrorist activities, and other matters that influence business and consumer spending. Fluctuationin economic conditions could prevent the Company from accurately forecasting demand for its products which could adversely affectits operating results or market share. Fluctuation in economicconditions and market instability in the United States and globally makes it difficult for the Company, customers and suppliersto accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause the Company to produce excess products that can increaseinventory carrying costs and result in obsolete inventory. Alternatively, this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortage ofproducts, or materials used in products, that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for products and a loss of marketshare. Markets are highly competitive whichcould limit the Company’s growth and reduce profitability. The market for sporting goods is highly fragmentedand intensely competitive. A majority of the Company’s products are in markets that are experiencing low growth rates. Escaladecompetes with a variety of regional, national and international manufacturers for customers, employees, products, services andother important aspects of the business. The Company has historically sold a large percentage of its sporting goods products tomass merchandisers and has increasingly attempted to expand sales to specialty retailer and dealer markets. In addition to competitionfor sales into those distribution channels, vendors also must compete in sporting goods with large format sporting goods stores,traditional sporting goods stores and chains, warehouse clubs, discount stores and department stores. Competition from on-lineretailers may also impact sales. Some of the current and potential competitors are larger than Escalade and have substantiallygreater financial resources that may be devoted to sourcing, promoting and selling their products, and may discount prices moreheavily than the Company can afford.  5    If the Company is unable to predictor effectively react to changes in consumer demand, it may lose customers and sales may decline. Success depends inpart on the ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand and preferences regarding sportinggoods. Products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subjectto change. The Company often makes commitments to manufacture products months in advance of the proposed delivery to customers.If Escalade misjudges the market for products, sales may decline significantly. The Company may have to take significant inventorymarkdowns on unpopular products that are overproduced and/or miss opportunities for other products that may rise in popularity,both of which could have a negative impact on profitability. A major shift in consumer demand away from sporting goods productscould also have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company derives a substantial portionof its revenue from a few significant customers and loss of any of these customers could materially affect our results of operationsand financial condition. The Company has two major customers whichaccounted for more than ten percent of consolidated gross sales and several other large customers, none of which represent morethan ten percent of consolidated gross sales, and historically has derived substantial revenues from these customers. The Companyhas two major customers which accounted for more than ten percent of total accounts receivable. The Company needs to continueto expand its customer base to minimize the effects of the loss of any single customer in the future. If sales to one or moreof the large customers would be lost or materially reduced, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to replacesuch revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s customers may experiencefinancial difficulties that could result in losses to the Company. From time to time, one or more of the Company’scustomers have experienced, are experiencing, or may in the future experience financial difficulties that impair their abilityto pay all amounts owed to the Company. In such instances, the customer may file bankruptcy or take other actions to restructurethe amounts owed to secured and unsecured creditors, including unsecured trade creditors such as the Company. When this occurs,the Company may not be able to collect the full amount owed to it by the customer, and in severe situations may have to writeoff all or a substantial portion of those customer receivables. As of the end of its 2016 fiscal year, the Company had net accountsreceivables of approximately $1.8 million due from customers about whom the Company has some concerns. Any significant resultinglosses incurred by the Company relating to these or other customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’sbusiness, results of operation, and financial condition. Quarterly operating results are subjectto fluctuation. Operating resultshave fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, and the Company expects that they will continue to do so in the future. Factorsthat could cause these quarterly fluctuations include the following: international, national and local general economicand market conditions; the size and growth of the overall sporting goods markets; intense competition among manufacturers, marketers,distributors and sellers of products; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs,categories of products and sports; seasonal demand for products; the size, timing and mix of purchases of products; fluctuationsand difficulty in forecasting operating results; ability to sustain, manage or forecast growth and inventories; new product developmentand introduction; ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; performance and reliabilityof products; customer service; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors; business disruptions;increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; changes in business strategy or development plans; generalrisks associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without limitation: exchange rates, import duties,tariffs, quotas and political and economic instability; changes in government regulations; any liability and other claims assertedagainst the Company; ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and other factors referenced or incorporated by referencein this Form 10-K and any other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  6    The Companymay pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures, or investments and the failure of a strategic transaction to produce anticipatedresults or the inability to fully integrate an acquired company could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business. The Company has madeacquisitions of complementary companies or businesses, which have been part of the strategic plan, and may continue to pursueacquisitions in the future from time to time. Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, andmay result in the diversion of capital and management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities. The Companymay not be able to successfully integrate operations that it acquires, including personnel, financial systems, distribution, andoperating procedures. If the Company fails to successfully integrate acquisitions, the Company’s business could suffer.In addition, acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expense or write-offs ofgoodwill or other intangibles, any of which could affect the Company’s financial position. The Company also has sometimesdivested or discontinued certain operations, assets, and products that did not perform to the Company’s expectations orno longer fit with the Company’s strategic objectives. Divestitures may result in gains, losses, contingent liabilities,write-offs, tax consequences, or other related costs and expenses that could affect the Company’s financial position. Escaladewill consider acquisitions, divestitures, and investments in the future, one or more of which, individually or in the aggregate,could be material to the Company’s overall business, operations or financial position. Growth may strain resources, which couldadversely affect the Company’s business and financial performance. The Company has grown in the past throughstrategic acquisitions, and continues to make acquisitions in its Sporting Goods business. Growth places additional demands onmanagement and operational systems. If the Company is not successful in continuing to support operational and financial systems,expanding the management team and increasing and effectively managing customers and suppliers, growth may result in operationalinefficiencies and ineffective management of the Company’s business, which could adversely affect its business and financialperformance. The Company’sability to operate and expand business and to respond to changing business and economic conditions will be dependent upon theavailability of adequate capital. The rate of expansionwill also depend on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn will depend in large part on cash flow generated by thebusiness and the availability of equity and debt capital. The Company can make no assurances that it will be able to obtain equityor debt capital on acceptable terms or at all. Our current senior secured revolving credit facility contains provisions that limitour ability to incur additional indebtedness or make substantial asset sales, which might otherwise be used to finance our operations.In the event of our insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, the lenders under our senior secured revolving creditfacility would be entitled to payment in full from our assets before distributions, if any, to our stockholders. The Companycould suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled management and key personnel. The Company’ssuccess depends in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified management executives and key personnel. Significantcompetition for qualified candidates exists in the Company’s business lines and geographic locations. If the Company isnot able to hire and retain its executives and key personnel, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain suchindividuals becomes more expensive, the Company may suffer adverse consequences to its business, operations, and financial condition. The Company’s business may beadversely affected by the actions of and risks associated with third-party suppliers. The raw materials that the Company purchasesfor manufacturing operations and many of the products that it sells are sourced from a wide variety of third-party suppliers.The Company cannot control the supply, design, function or cost of many of the products that are offered for sale and are dependenton the availability and pricing of key materials and products. Disruptions in the availability of raw materials used in productionof these products may adversely affect sales and result in customer dissatisfaction. In addition, global sourcing of many of theproducts sold is an important factor in the Company’s financial performance. The ability to find qualified suppliers andto access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced outsidethe United States. Political instability, financial instability of suppliers, merchandise quality issues, trade restrictions,tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, inflation and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyondthe Company’s control.  7    Historically, instabilityin the political and economic environments of the countries in which the Company or its suppliers obtain products and raw materialshas not had a material adverse effect on operations. However, the Company cannot predict the effect that future changes in economicor political conditions in the United States and in such foreign countries may have on operations. In the event of disruptionsor delays in supply due to economic or political conditions, such disruptions or delays could adversely affect results of operationsunless and until alternative supply arrangements could be made. In addition, products and materials purchased from alternativesources may be of lesser quality or more expensive than the products and materials currently purchased abroad. Deteriorationin relationships with suppliers or in the financial condition of suppliers could adversely affect liquidity, results of operationsand financial position. Access to materials,parts and supplies is dependent upon close relationships with suppliers and the ability to purchase products from the principalsuppliers on competitive terms. The Company does not enter into long-term supply contracts with these suppliers, and has no currentplans to do so in the future. These suppliers are not required to sell to the Company and are free to change the prices and otherterms. Any deterioration or change in the relationships with or in the financial condition of the Company’s significantsuppliers could have an adverse impact on its ability to procure materials and parts necessary to produce products for sale anddistribution. If any of the significant suppliers terminated or significantly curtailed its relationship with the Company or ceasedoperations, the Company would be forced to expand relationships with other suppliers, seek out new relationships with new suppliersor risk a loss in market share due to diminished product offerings and availability. Any change in one or more of these suppliers’willingness or ability to continue to supply the Company with their products could have an adverse impact on the Company’sliquidity, results of operations and financial position. Disruptionsto our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our operations. Many of the Company’sproducts are manufactured outside the United States. Those products must be transported by third parties over large geographicdistances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products could occur due to work stoppages, port strikes, lack of availabilityof transportation, and other factors beyond the Company’s control. Such delays could impair our ability to timely and efficientlydeliver our products, and could adversely impact our operating results. The Company may be subject to productwarranty claims that require the replacement or repair of the product sold. Such warranty claims could adversely affect the Company’sfinancial position and relationships with its customers. The Company manufactures and/or distributesa variety of products. From time to time, such products may contain manufacturing defects or design flaws that are not detectedprior to sale, particularly as to new product introductions or upon design changes to existing products. The failure to identifyand correct manufacturing defects and product design issues prior to the sale of those products could result in product warrantyclaims that result in costs to replace or repair any such defective products. Because many of the Company’s products aresold to retailers for broad consumer distribution and/or to customers who buy in large quantities, the costs associated with productwarranty claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial position. Productwarranty claims also could cause customer dissatisfaction that may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s reputationand on the Company’s relationships with its customers, which may result in lost or reduced sales.  8    The Companymay be subject to various types of litigation and the Company’s insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages relatedto those claims. From time to timethe Company or its subsidiaries may be involved in lawsuits or other claims arising in the course of business, including thoserelated to product liability, consumer protection, employment, intellectual property, torts and other matters. In addition, itmay be subject to lawsuits relating to the design, manufacture or distribution of its products. The Company may be subject tolawsuits resulting from injuries associated with the use of sporting goods equipment that it sells and information security andprint finishing products that it sold prior to divesting that business. The Company may incur losses relating to these claimsor the defense of these claims. There is a risk that claims or liabilities will exceed the Company’s insurance coverage.In addition, the Company may be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future. Further, the Company is subject toregulation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and similar state regulatory agencies. If the Company fails to comply withgovernment and industry safety standards, it may be subject to claims, lawsuits, fines, product recalls and adverse publicitythat could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Intellectual property rights are valuable,and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of products. The Company obtainspatents, trademarks and copyrights for intellectual property, which represent important assets to the Company. If the Companyfails to adequately protect intellectual property through patents, trademarks and copyrights, its intellectual property rightsmay be misappropriated by others, invalidated or challenged, and our competitors could duplicate the Company’s productsor may otherwise limit any competitive design or manufacturing advantages. The Company believes that success is likely to dependupon continued innovation, technical expertise, marketing skills and customer support and services rather than on legal protectionof intellectual property rights. However, the Company intends to aggressively assert its intellectual property rights when necessary. The Companyis subject to risks associated with laws and regulations related to health, safety and environmental protection. Products, and theproduction and distribution of products, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmentalprotection. Laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmental protection have been passed in several jurisdictionsin which the Company operates in the United States and abroad. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effectsbased on the nature of operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will nothave a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. International operations expose theCompany to the unique risks inherent in foreign operations. The Company has operations in Mexico. Foreignoperations encounter risks similar to those faced by U.S. operations, as well as risks inherent in foreign operations, such aslocal customs and regulatory constraints, control over product quality and content, foreign trade policies, competitive conditions,foreign currency fluctuations and unstable political and economic conditions. The Company’s business relationships in Asiaand joint venture in Sweden further increase its exposure to these foreign operating risks, which could have an adverse impacton the Company’s income and profitability. The Company could be adversely affectedby changes in currency exchange rates and/or the value of the United States dollar. The Company is exposed to risks related tothe effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the value of the United States dollar. Changes in currency exchangerates and the value of the United States dollar can have a significant impact on earnings. While the Company carefully watchesfluctuations in currency exchange rates, these types of changes can have material adverse effects on the Company’s business,results of operations and financial condition.  9    Failure to improve and maintain thequality of internal controls over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the ability to provide timely andaccurate financial information, which could harm the Company’s reputation and share price. Management is responsible for establishingand maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting for the Company to provide reasonable assurance regardingthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accountingprinciples. Management cannot be certain that weaknesses and deficiencies in internal controls will not arise or be identifiedor that the Company will be able to correct and maintain adequate controls over financial processes and reporting in the future.Any failure to maintain adequate controls or to adequately implement required new or improved controls could harm operating resultsor cause failure to meet reporting obligations in a timely and accurate manner. Ineffective internal controls over financial reportingcould also cause investors to lose confidence in reported financial information, which could adversely affect the trading priceof the Company’s common stock. Disclosure controls and procedures are designedto provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, management, including the Chief Executive Officer andChief Financial Officer, does not expect that disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A controlsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives ofthe control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems,no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Problems with the Company’s informationsystem software or hardware could disrupt operations and negatively impact financial results and materially adversely affect theCompany’s business operations.  The Company relies on a suite of applicationsand third party software to receive and process customer orders and for the core of its manufacturing, distribution, and accountingsystems. These systems, if not functioning properly, could disrupt its operations, including the Company’s ability to receiveand ship orders and to process financial information or engage in similar normal business activities. Any material disruption,malfunction or other similar problems in or with these systems could negatively impact our financial results and materially adverselyaffect our business operations. The preparation of the Company’sfinancial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results. The preparation of consolidated financialstatements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make significantestimates that may affect financial statements. Due to the inherent nature of making estimates, actual results may vary substantiallyfrom such estimates, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financialcondition. For more information on the Company’s critical accounting estimates, please see the Critical Accounting Estimatessection of this Form 10-K. Changes in accounting standards couldimpact reported earnings and financial condition. The accounting standard setters, includingthe Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, periodically change the financial accountingand reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. These changes canbe hard to predict and apply and can materially affect how the Company records and reports its financial condition and resultsof operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, which may resultin the restatement of prior period financial statements.  10    The Company’seffective tax rate may fluctuate. The Company is a multi-channel provider ofsporting goods and, until October 2014, was a multi-national, multi-channel provider of information security and print finishingproducts. As a result, the Company’s effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the variouscountries, states and other jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The effective tax rate may be lower or higher than itstax rates have been in the past due to numerous factors, including the sources of income, any agreement with taxing authoritiesin various jurisdictions, the tax filing positions taken in various jurisdictions and changes in the political environment inthe jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The Company bases estimates of an effective tax rate at any given point in timeupon a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to the Company and to estimates of the amount of business likely to be donein any given jurisdiction. The loss of one or more agreements with taxing jurisdictions, a change in the mix of business fromyear to year and from country to country, changes in rules related to accounting for income taxes, changes in tax laws and anyof the multiple jurisdictions in which the Company operates, or adverse outcomes from tax audits that the Company may be subjectto in any of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, could result in an unfavorable change in the effective tax ratewhich could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. Various corporate tax reform bills and otherproposals have been or are currently under consideration by Congress and the new Presidential administration.  These proposalsinclude, among other items, corporate income tax rate changes in varying, uncertain, or unspecified amounts, the reduction orelimination of certain corporate tax incentives, modifications to the existing regime for taxing overseas earnings (includingconsideration of a minimum tax on adjusted unrepatriated foreign earnings and a cash flow tax with border adjustments that couldtreat imports less favorably than exports), and measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting.  It is not clearwhether, or to what extent, these proposals may be enacted.  Although the overall impact that such proposals may have onour future effective tax rate is unclear at this time, significant changes to the U.S. taxation of our international income couldhave a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The market price of the Company’scommon stock is likely to be highly volatile as the stock market in general can be highly volatile. The public trading of the Company’scommon stock is based on many factors which could cause fluctuation in the Company’s stock price. These factors may include,among other things: ·General                                         economic and market conditions;·Actual                                         or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;·Limited                                         research coverage by securities analysts;·Relatively                                         low market capitalization resulting in low trading volume in the Company’s stock;·If                                         securities analysts provide coverage, our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts'                                         estimates or expectations;·Conditions                                         or trends in the Company’s industries;·Changes                                         in the market valuations of other companies in the Company’s industries;·Announcements                                         by the Company or the Company’s competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic                                         partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives;·Capital                                         commitments;·Additions                                         or departures of key personnel; ·Sales                                         and repurchases of the Company’s common stock; and·The                                         ability to maintain listing of the Company’s common stock on the NASDAQ Global                                         Market. Many of these factorsare beyond the Company’s control. These factors may cause the market price of the Company’s common stock to decline,regardless of operating performance. If we are unable to pay quarterly dividendsat intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.  Our quarterly cash dividend is currently $0.11per common share. The dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. Our ability to pay dividends will dependon our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic,financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our Board of Directors (Board) may, at its discretion, increaseor decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Any failure to pay dividendsafter we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negativelyimpact our stock price.  11    Unauthorizeddisclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information could harm the Company’s business and its standing with itscustomers. Through sales and marketing activities, theCompany collects and stores certain information that customers provide to purchase products or services or otherwise communicateand interact with the Company. Despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, the Company cannot be certainthat all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate the Company’snetwork security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer or business information. In addition, an employee, acontractor or other third party with whom the Company does business may attempt to circumvent the Company’s security measuresin order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Loss of customer or business informationcould disrupt operations, damage the Company’s reputation, and expose the Company to claims from customers, financial institutions,payment card associations and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, resultsof operations and financial condition. In addition, compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standardsmay result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. Terrorist attacks,acts of war or natural disaster may seriously harm the Company’s business. Among the chief uncertaintiesfacing the nation and the world and, as a result, the business is the instability and conflict in the Middle East. Obviously,no one can predict with certainty what the overall economic impact will be as a result of these circumstances. Terrorist attacksmay cause damage or disruption to the Company, employees, facilities and customers, which could significantly impact net sales,costs and expenses and financial condition. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and international responsesto terrorist attacks, and other acts of war and hostility may cause greater uncertainty and cause business to suffer in ways theCompany currently cannot predict. In addition, anynatural disaster or other serious disruption to one of the Company’s manufacturing or distribution sights due to fire, tornado,earthquake or any other causes could damage a material portion of inventory or impair our ability to provide product to our customersand could negatively affect our sales and profitability. New laws, policies, regulations, rulemakingand oversight, as well as changes to those currently in effect, could adversely impact our earnings, cash flows and operations. Our assets and operations are subject to regulationand oversight by federal, state, and local regulatory authorities. Legislative changes, as well as regulatory actions taken bythese agencies, have the potential to adversely affect our profitability. In addition, a certain degree of regulatory uncertaintyis created by the recent change in U.S. presidential administrations. It remains unclear specifically what the new administrationmay do with respect to future policies and regulations that may affect us. Regulation affects many aspects of our business andextends to such matters as (i) federal, state, and local taxation; (ii) rates (which include tax, commodity, surcharges and fuel);(iii) the integrity, safety and security of facilities and operations; (iv) the acquisition of other businesses; (v) the acquisition,extension, disposition or abandonment of services or facilities; (vi) reporting and information requirements; and (vii) the maintenanceof accounts and records. Failure to sustain a continuing economicrecovery in the United States and elsewhere could have a substantial adverse effect on our business. Our business is tied to general economic andindustry conditions as demand for sporting goods depends largely on the strength of the economy, employment levels, consumer confidencelevels and the availability and cost of credit. These factors have had and could continue to have a substantial impact on ourbusiness. Certain political developments occurring thispast year have provided increased economic uncertainty. The United Kingdom's decision to exit the European Union and the resultsof the presidential election in the U.S. both could result in economic and trade policy actions that would impact economic conditionsin various countries, the cost of importing into the U.S. and the competitive landscape of our customers, suppliers and competitors.  12    Adverse global economic conditions could alsocause our customers and suppliers to experience severe economic constraints in the future, including bankruptcy, which could havea material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. Our business is subject to risks associatedwith sourcing and manufacturing overseas. We import both raw materials and finishedgoods into our operating facilities. Our ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may be affected by conditionsat ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputesand work stoppages, political unrest, severe weather, or security requirements in the United States and other countries. Theseissues could delay importation of products or require us to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruptionto our customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transportation costs, whichcould have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition, specifically our gross margin and overall profitability. Substantially all of our import operationsare subject to customs and tax requirements as well as trade regulations, such as tariffs and quotas set by governments throughmutual agreements or bilateral actions. In addition, the countries in which our products are manufactured or imported may fromtime to time impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions.Adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions, or our suppliers' failure to comply with customs regulations or similarlaws, could harm our business. In this regard, the results of the November 2016 U.S. election and the Brexit vote have introducedgreater uncertainty with respect to future tax and trade regulations. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, such as thedisallowance of tax deductions on imported merchandise or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have a materialadverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our operations are also subject to the effectsof international trade agreements and regulations that impose requirements that could adversely affect our business, such as settingquotas on products that may be imported from a particular country. These risks are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Form 10-K may includeadditional factors which could adversely impact the Company’s business and financial performance. Moreover, the Companyoperates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possiblefor management to predict all risk factors, nor can the Company assess the impact of all factors on business or the extent towhich any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-lookingstatements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as aprediction of actual results. "
8,ESCA,ESCALADE INC,2016-02-23,"ITEM 1A—RISK FACTORS Operating results may be impactedby changes in the economy that influence business and consumer spending. Operating resultsare directly impacted by the health of the North American and to a lesser extent, European and Asian economies. We cannot predicthow robust the economy will be or whether or not it will be sustained. If the economic recovery slows, or if the economy experiencesa prolonged period of decelerating or negative growth, the Company’s results of operations may be negatively impacted. Ingeneral, the Company’s sales depend on discretionary spending by consumers. Business and financial performance may be adverselyaffected by current and future economic conditions, including unemployment levels, energy costs, interest rates, recession, inflation,the impact of natural disasters and terrorist activities, and other matters that influence business and consumer spending. Fluctuationin economic conditions could prevent the Company from accurately forecasting demand for its products which could adversely affectits operating results or market share. Fluctuation ineconomic conditions and market instability in the United States and globally makes it difficult for the Company, customers andsuppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause the Company to produce excess products that canincrease inventory carrying costs and result in obsolete inventory. Alternatively, this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortageof products, or materials used in products, that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for products and a loss of marketshare. Markets are highly competitive whichcould limit the Company’s growth and reduce profitability. The market for sporting goods is highlyfragmented and intensely competitive. A majority of the Company’s products are in markets that are experiencing low growthrates. Escalade competes with a variety of regional, national and international manufacturers for customers, employees, products,services and other important aspects of the business. The Company has historically sold a large percentage of its sporting goodsproducts to mass merchandisers and has increasingly attempted to expand sales to specialty retailer and dealer markets. In additionto competition for sales into those distribution channels, vendors also must compete in sporting goods with large format sportinggoods stores, traditional sporting goods stores and chains, warehouse clubs, discount stores and department stores. Competitionfrom on-line retailers may also impact sales. Some of the current and potential competitors are larger than Escalade and have substantiallygreater financial resources that may be devoted to sourcing, promoting and selling their products, and may discount prices moreheavily than the Company can afford. If the Company is unable to predictor effectively react to changes in consumer demand, it may lose customers and sales may decline. Success dependsin part on the ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand and preferences regarding sportinggoods. Products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subjectto change. The Company often makes commitments to manufacture products months in advance of the proposed delivery to customers.If Escalade misjudges the market for products, sales may decline significantly. The Company may have to take significant inventorymarkdowns on unpopular products that are overproduced and/or miss opportunities for other products that may rise in popularity,both of which could have a negative impact on profitability. A major shift in consumer demand away from sporting goods productscould also have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.  5   The Company derives a substantialportion of its revenue from a few significant customers and loss of any of these customers could materially affect our resultsof operations and financial condition. The Company has one major customer whichaccounted for more than ten percent of consolidated gross sales and several other large customers, none of which represent morethan ten percent of consolidated gross sales, and historically has derived substantial revenues from these customers. The Companyhas one major customer which accounted for more than ten percent of total accounts receivable. The Company needs to continue toexpand its customer base to minimize the effects of the loss of any single customer in the future. If sales to one or more of thelarge customers would be lost or materially reduced, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to replace such revenues,which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s customers mayexperience financial difficulties that could result in losses to the Company. From time to time, one or more of the Company’scustomers have experienced, are experiencing, or may in the future experience financial difficulties that impair their abilityto pay all amounts owed to the Company. In such instances, the customer may file bankruptcy or take other actions to restructurethe amounts owed to secured and unsecured creditors, including unsecured trade creditors such as the Company. When this occurs,the Company may not be able to collect the full amount owed to it by the customer, and in severe situations may have to write offall or a substantial portion of those customer receivables. As of the end of its 2015 fiscal year, the Company had net accountsreceivables of approximately $3.5 million due from customers about whom the Company has some concerns. Any significant resultinglosses incurred by the Company relating to these or other customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’sbusiness, results of operation, and financial condition. Quarterly operating results are subjectto fluctuation. Operating resultshave fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, and the Company expects that they will continue to do so in the future. Factorsthat could cause these quarterly fluctuations include the following: international, national and local general economicand market conditions; the size and growth of the overall sporting goods markets; intense competition among manufacturers, marketers,distributors and sellers of products; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categoriesof products and sports; seasonal demand for products; the size, timing and mix of purchases of products; fluctuations and difficultyin forecasting operating results; ability to sustain, manage or forecast growth and inventories; new product development and introduction;ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; performance and reliability of products; customerservice; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors; business disruptions; increased costs of freightand transportation to meet delivery deadlines; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated withdoing business outside the United States, including, without limitation: exchange rates, import duties, tariffs, quotas and politicaland economic instability; changes in government regulations; any liability and other claims asserted against the Company; abilityto attract and retain qualified personnel; and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and anyother filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  6   The Companymay pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures, or investments and the failure of a strategic transaction to produce anticipatedresults or the inability to fully integrate an acquired company could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business. The Company hasmade acquisitions of complementary companies or businesses, which have been part of the strategic plan, and may continue to pursueacquisitions in the future from time to time. Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, and mayresult in the diversion of capital and management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities. The Company maynot be able to successfully integrate operations that it acquires, including personnel, financial systems, distribution, and operatingprocedures. If the Company fails to successfully integrate acquisitions, the Company’s business could suffer. In addition,acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expense or write-offs of goodwill or otherintangibles, any of which could affect the Company’s financial position. The Company also has sometimes divested or discontinuedcertain operations, assets, and products that did not perform to the Company’s expectations or no longer fit with the Company’sstrategic objectives. Divestitures may result in gains, losses, contingent liabilities, write-offs, tax consequences, or otherrelated costs and expenses that could affect the Company’s financial position. Escalade will consider acquisitions, divestitures,and investments in the future, one or more of which, individually or in the aggregate, could be material to the Company’soverall business, operations or financial position. Growth may strain resources, whichcould adversely affect the Company’s business and financial performance. The Company has grown in the past throughstrategic acquisitions, and continues to make acquisitions in its Sporting Goods business. Growth places additional demands onmanagement and operational systems. If the Company is not successful in continuing to support operational and financial systems,expanding the management team and increasing and effectively managing customers and suppliers, growth may result in operationalinefficiencies and ineffective management of the Company’s business, which could adversely affect its business and financialperformance. The Company’sability to operate and expand business and to respond to changing business and economic conditions will be dependent upon the availabilityof adequate capital. The rate of expansionwill also depend on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn will depend in large part on cash flow generated by thebusiness and the availability of equity and debt capital. The Company can make no assurances that it will be able to obtain equityor debt capital on acceptable terms or at all. Our current senior secured revolving credit facility contains provisions that limitour ability to incur additional indebtedness or make substantial asset sales, which might otherwise be used to finance our operations.In the event of our insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, the lenders under our senior secured revolving creditfacility would be entitled to payment in full from our assets before distributions, if any, to our stockholders. The Companycould suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled management and key personnel. The Company’ssuccess depends in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified management executives and key personnel. Significantcompetition for qualified candidates exists in the Company’s business lines and geographic locations. If the Company is notable to hire and retain its executives and key personnel, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain such individualsbecomes more expensive, the Company may suffer adverse consequences to its business, operations, and financial condition. The Company’s business maybe adversely affected by the actions of and risks associated with third-party suppliers. The raw materials that the Company purchasesfor manufacturing operations and many of the products that it sells are sourced from a wide variety of third-party suppliers. TheCompany cannot control the supply, design, function or cost of many of the products that are offered for sale and are dependenton the availability and pricing of key materials and products. Disruptions in the availability of raw materials used in productionof these products may adversely affect sales and result in customer dissatisfaction. In addition, global sourcing of many of theproducts sold is an important factor in the Company’s financial performance. The ability to find qualified suppliers andto access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced outsidethe United States. Political instability, financial instability of suppliers, merchandise quality issues, trade restrictions, tariffs,currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, inflation and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond the Company’scontrol.  7   Historically,instability in the political and economic environments of the countries in which the Company or its suppliers obtain products andraw materials has not had a material adverse effect on operations. However, the Company cannot predict the effect that future changesin economic or political conditions in such foreign countries may have on operations. In the event of disruptions or delays insupply due to economic or political conditions in foreign countries, such disruptions or delays could adversely affect resultsof operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements could be made. In addition, products and materials purchased fromalternative sources may be of lesser quality or more expensive than the products and materials currently purchased abroad. Deteriorationin relationships with suppliers or in the financial condition of suppliers could adversely affect liquidity, results of operationsand financial position. Access to materials,parts and supplies is dependent upon close relationships with suppliers and the ability to purchase products from the principalsuppliers on competitive terms. The Company does not enter into long-term supply contracts with these suppliers, and has no currentplans to do so in the future. These suppliers are not required to sell to the Company and are free to change the prices and otherterms. Any deterioration or change in the relationships with or in the financial condition of the Company’s significant supplierscould have an adverse impact on its ability to procure materials and parts necessary to produce products for sale and distribution.If any of the significant suppliers terminated or significantly curtailed its relationship with the Company or ceased operations,the Company would be forced to expand relationships with other suppliers, seek out new relationships with new suppliers or riska loss in market share due to diminished product offerings and availability. Any change in one or more of these suppliers’willingness or ability to continue to supply the Company with their products could have an adverse impact on the Company’sliquidity, results of operations and financial position. Disruptionsto our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our operations. Many of the Company’sproducts are manufactured outside the United States. Those products must be transported by third parties over large geographicdistances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products could occur due to work stoppages, port strikes, lack of availabilityof transportation, and other factors beyond the Company’s control. Such delays could impair our ability to timely and efficientlydeliver our products, and could adversely impact our operating results. The Company may be subject to productwarranty claims that require the replacement or repair of the product sold. Such warranty claims could adversely affect the Company’sfinancial position and relationships with its customers. The Company manufactures and/or distributesa variety of products. From time to time, such products may contain manufacturing defects or design flaws that are not detectedprior to sale, particularly as to new product introductions or upon design changes to existing products. The failure to identifyand correct manufacturing defects and product design issues prior to the sale of those products could result in product warrantyclaims that result in costs to replace or repair any such defective products. Because many of the Company’s products aresold to retailers for broad consumer distribution and/or to customers who buy in large quantities, the costs associated with productwarranty claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial position. Productwarranty claims also could cause customer dissatisfaction that may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s reputationand on the Company’s relationships with its customers, which may result in lost or reduced sales. The Companymay be subject to various types of litigation and the Company’s insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages relatedto those claims. From time to timethe Company or its subsidiaries may be involved in lawsuits or other claims arising in the course of business, including thoserelated to product liability, consumer protection, employment, intellectual property, torts and other matters. In addition, itmay be subject to lawsuits relating to the design, manufacture or distribution of its products. The Company may be subject to lawsuitsresulting from injuries associated with the use of sporting goods equipment that it sells and information security and print finishingproducts that it sold prior to divesting that business. The Company may incur losses relating to these claims or the defense ofthese claims. There is a risk that claims or liabilities will exceed the Company’s insurance coverage. In addition, the Companymay be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future. Further, the Company is subject to regulation by the ConsumerProduct Safety Commission and similar state regulatory agencies. If the Company fails to comply with government and industry safetystandards, it may be subject to claims, lawsuits, fines, product recalls and adverse publicity that could have a material adverseeffect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.  8   Intellectual property rights arevaluable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of products. The Company obtainspatents, trademarks and copyrights for intellectual property, which represent important assets to the Company. If the Company failsto adequately protect intellectual property through patents, trademarks and copyrights, its intellectual property rights may bemisappropriated by others, invalidated or challenged, and our competitors could duplicate the Company’s products or may otherwiselimit any competitive design or manufacturing advantages. The Company believes that success is likely to depend upon continuedinnovation, technical expertise, marketing skills and customer support and services rather than on legal protection of intellectualproperty rights. However, the Company intends to aggressively assert its intellectual property rights when necessary. The Companyis subject to risks associated with laws and regulations related to health, safety and environmental protection. Products, andthe production and distribution of products, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmentalprotection. Laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmental protection have been passed in several jurisdictionsin which the Company operates in the United States and abroad. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effectsbased on the nature of operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will nothave a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. International operations expose theCompany to the unique risks inherent in foreign operations. The Company has operations in Mexico. Foreignoperations encounter risks similar to those faced by U.S. operations, as well as risks inherent in foreign operations, such aslocal customs and regulatory constraints, control over product quality and content, foreign trade policies, competitive conditions,foreign currency fluctuations and unstable political and economic conditions. The Company’s business relationships in Asiaand joint venture in Sweden further increase its exposure to these foreign operating risks, which could have an adverse impacton the Company’s income and profitability. The Company could be adversely affectedby changes in currency exchange rates and/or the value of the United States dollar. The Company is exposed to risks relatedto the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the value of the United States dollar. Changes in currency exchangerates and the value of the United States dollar can have a significant impact on earnings. While the Company carefully watchesfluctuations in currency exchange rates, these types of changes can have material adverse effects on the Company’s business,results of operations and financial condition. Failure to improve and maintain thequality of internal controls over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the ability to provide timely and accuratefinancial information, which could harm the Company’s reputation and share price. Management is responsible for establishingand maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting for the Company to provide reasonable assurance regarding thereliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accountingprinciples. Management cannot be certain that weaknesses and deficiencies in internal controls will not arise or be identifiedor that the Company will be able to correct and maintain adequate controls over financial processes and reporting in the future.Any failure to maintain adequate controls or to adequately implement required new or improved controls could harm operating resultsor cause failure to meet reporting obligations in a timely and accurate manner. Ineffective internal controls over financial reportingcould also cause investors to lose confidence in reported financial information, which could adversely affect the trading priceof the Company’s common stock.  9   Disclosure controls and procedures aredesigned to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, management, including the Chief Executive Officerand Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A controlsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives ofthe control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems,no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Problems with the Company’sinformation system software or hardware could disrupt operations and negatively impact financial results and materially adverselyaffect the Company’s business operations.  The Company relies on a suite of applicationsand third party software to receive and process customer orders and for the core of its manufacturing, distribution, and accountingsystems. These systems, if not functioning properly, could disrupt its operations, including the Company’s ability to receiveand ship orders and to process financial information or engage in similar normal business activities. Any material disruption,malfunction or other similar problems in or with these systems could negatively impact our financial results and materially adverselyaffect our business operations. The preparation of the Company’sfinancial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results. The preparation of consolidated financialstatements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make significantestimates that may affect financial statements. Due to the inherent nature of making estimates, actual results may vary substantiallyfrom such estimates, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financialcondition. For more information on the Company’s critical accounting estimates, please see the Critical Accounting Estimatessection of this Form 10-K. Changes in accounting standards couldimpact reported earnings and financial condition. The accounting standard setters, includingthe Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, periodically change the financial accountingand reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. These changes canbe hard to predict and apply and can materially affect how the Company records and reports its financial condition and resultsof operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, which may resultin the restatement of prior period financial statements. The Company’seffective tax rate may fluctuate. The Company is a multi-channel providerof sporting goods and, until October 2014, was a multi-national, multi-channel provider of information security and print finishingproducts. As a result, the Company’s effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the variouscountries, states and other jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The effective tax rate may be lower or higher than itstax rates have been in the past due to numerous factors, including the sources of income, any agreement with taxing authoritiesin various jurisdictions, the tax filing positions taken in various jurisdictions and changes in the political environment in thejurisdictions in which the Company operates. The Company bases estimates of an effective tax rate at any given point in time upona calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to the Company and to estimates of the amount of business likely to be done in anygiven jurisdiction. The loss of one or more agreements with taxing jurisdictions, a change in the mix of business from year toyear and from country to country, changes in rules related to accounting for income taxes, changes in tax laws and any of the multiplejurisdictions in which the Company operates, or adverse outcomes from tax audits that the Company may be subject to in any of thejurisdictions in which the Company operates, could result in an unfavorable change in the effective tax rate which could have anadverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.  10   The market price of the Company’scommon stock is likely to be highly volatile as the stock market in general can be highly volatile. The public trading of the Company’scommon stock is based on many factors which could cause fluctuation in the Company’s stock price. These factors may include,among other things: ·General economic and marketconditions;·Actual or anticipated variationsin quarterly operating results;·Limited research coverageby securities analysts;·Relatively low market capitalizationresulting in low trading volume in the Company’s stock;·If securities analysts providecoverage, our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts' estimates or expectations;·Conditions or trends inthe Company’s industries;·Changes in the market valuationsof other companies in the Company’s industries;·Announcements by the Companyor the Company’s competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategicinitiatives;·Capital commitments;·Additions or departuresof key personnel; ·Sales and repurchases ofthe Company’s common stock; and·The ability to maintainlisting of the Company’s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market. Many of thesefactors are beyond the Company’s control. These factors may cause the market price of the Company’s common stock todecline, regardless of operating performance. If we are unable to pay quarterlydividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.  Our quarterly cash dividend is currently$0.11 per common share. The dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. Our ability to pay dividends willdepend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future.

Our Board of Directors (Board) may, at its discretion, increaseor decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Any failure to pay dividendsafter we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impactour stock price. Unauthorizeddisclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information could harm the Company’s business and its standing with itscustomers. Through sales and marketing activities,the Company collects and stores certain information that customers provide to purchase products or services or otherwise communicateand interact with the Company. Despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, the Company cannot be certainthat all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate the Company’snetwork security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer or business information. In addition, an employee, acontractor or other third party with whom the Company does business may attempt to circumvent the Company’s security measuresin order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Loss of customer or business informationcould disrupt operations, damage the Company’s reputation, and expose the Company to claims from customers, financial institutions,payment card associations and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, resultsof operations and financial condition. In addition, compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standardsmay result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes.  11   Terroristattacks, acts of war or natural disaster may seriously harm the Company’s business. Among the chiefuncertainties facing the nation and the world and, as a result, the business is the instability and conflict in the Middle East.Obviously, no one can predict with certainty what the overall economic impact will be as a result of these circumstances. Terroristattacks may cause damage or disruption to the Company, employees, facilities and customers, which could significantly impact netsales, costs and expenses and financial condition. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and international responsesto terrorist attacks, and other acts of war and hostility may cause greater uncertainty and cause business to suffer in ways theCompany currently cannot predict. In addition, anynatural disaster or other serious disruption to one of the Company’s manufacturing or distribution sights due to fire, tornado,earthquake or any other causes could damage a material portion of inventory or impair our ability to provide product to our customersand could negatively affect our sales and profitability. These risks are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Form 10-K may includeadditional factors which could adversely impact the Company’s business and financial performance. Moreover, the Company operatesin a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for managementto predict all risk factors, nor can the Company assess the impact of all factors on business or the extent to which any factor,or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction ofactual results. "
16,ESCA,ESCALADE INC,2015-02-25,"ITEM 1A—RISK FACTORS Operating results may be impactedby changes in the economy that influence business and consumer spending. Operating resultsare directly impacted by the health of the North American and to a lesser extent, European and Asian economies. While the globaleconomy is experiencing some level of recovery from the recent downturn, we cannot predict how robust the recovery will be or whetheror not it will be sustained. If the economic recovery slows, or if the economy experiences a prolonged period of decelerating ornegative growth, the Company’s results of operations may be negatively impacted. In general, the Company’s sales dependon discretionary spending by consumers. Business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and future economicconditions, including unemployment levels, energy costs, interest rates, recession, inflation, the impact of natural disastersand terrorist activities, and other matters that influence business and consumer spending. 5  Fluctuationin economic conditions could prevent the Company from accurately forecasting demand for its products which could adversely affectits operating results or market share. Fluctuation ineconomic conditions and market instability in the United States and globally makes it difficult for the Company, customers andsuppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause the Company to produce excess products that canincrease inventory carrying costs and result in obsolete inventory. Alternatively, this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortageof products, or materials used in products, that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for products and a loss of marketshare. Markets are highly competitive whichcould limit the Company’s growth and reduce profitability. The market for sporting goods is highlyfragmented and intensely competitive. A majority of the Company’s products are in markets that are experiencing low growthrates. Escalade competes with a variety of regional, national and international manufacturers for customers, employees, products,services and other important aspects of the business. The Company has historically sold a large percentage of its sporting goodsproducts to mass merchandisers and has increasingly attempted to expand sales to specialty retailer and dealer markets. In additionto competition for sales into those distribution channels, vendors also must compete in sporting goods with large format sportinggoods stores, traditional sporting goods stores and chains, warehouse clubs, discount stores and department stores. Competitionfrom on-line retailers may also impact sales. Some of the current and potential competitors are larger than Escalade and have substantiallygreater financial resources that may be devoted to sourcing, promoting and selling their products, and may discount prices moreheavily than the Company can afford. If the Company is unable to predictor effectively react to changes in consumer demand, it may lose customers and sales may decline. Success dependsin part on the ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand and preferences regarding sportinggoods. Products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subjectto change. The Company often makes commitments to manufacture products months in advance of the proposed delivery to customers.If Escalade misjudges the market for products, sales may decline significantly. The Company may have to take significant inventorymarkdowns on unpopular products that are overproduced and/or miss opportunities for other products that may rise in popularity,both of which could have a negative impact on profitability. A major shift in consumer demand away from sporting goods productscould also have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company derives a substantialportion of its revenue from a few significant customers and loss of any of these customers could materially affect our resultsof operations and financial condition.  The Company has one major customer whichaccounted for more than ten percent of consolidated gross sales and several other large customers, none of which represent morethan ten percent of consolidated gross sales, and historically has derived substantial revenues from these customers. The Companyneeds to continue to expand its customer base to minimize the effects of the loss of any single customer in the future. If salesto one or more of the large customers would be lost or materially reduced, there can be no assurance that the Company will be ableto replace such revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financialcondition. 6  Quarterly operating results are subjectto fluctuation. Operating resultshave fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, and the Company expects that they will continue to do so in the future. Factorsthat could cause these quarterly fluctuations include the following: international, national and local general economicand market conditions; the size and growth of the overall sporting goods markets; intense competition among manufacturers, marketers,distributors and sellers of products; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categoriesof products and sports; seasonal demand for products; the size, timing and mix of purchases of products; fluctuations and difficultyin forecasting operating results; ability to sustain, manage or forecast growth and inventories; new product development and introduction;ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; performance and reliability of products; customerservice; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors; business disruptions; increased costs of freightand transportation to meet delivery deadlines; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated withdoing business outside the United States, including, without limitation: exchange rates, import duties, tariffs, quotas and politicaland economic instability; changes in government regulations; any liability and other claims asserted against the Company; abilityto attract and retain qualified personnel; and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and anyother filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Companymay pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures, or investments and the failure of a strategic transaction to produce anticipatedresults or the inability to fully integrate an acquired company could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business. The Company hasmade acquisitions of complementary companies or businesses, which have been part of the strategic plan, and may continue to pursueacquisitions in the future from time to time. Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, and mayresult in the diversion of capital and management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities. The Company maynot be able to successfully integrate operations that it acquires, including personnel, financial systems, distribution, and operatingprocedures. If the Company fails to successfully integrate acquisitions, the Company’s business could suffer. In addition,acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expense or write-offs of goodwill or otherintangibles, any of which could affect the Company’s financial position. The Company also has sometimes divested or discontinuedcertain operations, assets, and products that did not perform to the Company’s expectations or no longer fit with the Company’sstrategic objectives. Escalade will consider acquisitions, divestitures, and investments in the future, one or more of which, individuallyor in the aggregate, could be material to the Company’s overall business, operations or financial position. Growth may strain resources, whichcould adversely affect the Company’s business and financial performance. The Company has grown in the past throughstrategic acquisitions. Growth places additional demands on management and operational systems. If the Company is not successfulin continuing to support operational and financial systems, expanding the management team and increasing and effectively managingcustomers and suppliers, growth may result in operational inefficiencies and ineffective management of the Company’s business,which could adversely affect its business and financial performance. The Company’sability to operate and expand business and to respond to changing business and economic conditions will be dependent upon the availabilityof adequate capital.  Therate of expansion will also depend on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn will depend in large part on cash flowgenerated by the business and the availability of equity and debt capital. The Company can make no assurances that it will be ableto obtain equity or debt capital on acceptable terms or at all. Our current senior secured revolving credit facility contains provisionsthat limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or make substantial asset sales, which might otherwise be used to financeour operations. In the event of our insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, the lenders under our senior securedrevolving credit facility would be entitled to payment in full from our assets before distributions, if any, to our stockholders. The Companycould suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled management and key personnel. The Company’ssuccess depends in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified management executives and key personnel. Significantcompetition for qualified candidates exists in the Company’s business lines and geographic locations. If the Company is notable to hire and retain its executives and key personnel, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain such individualsbecomes more expensive, the Company may suffer adverse consequences to its business, operations, and financial condition. 7  The Company’s business maybe adversely affected by the actions of and risks associated with third-party suppliers. The raw materials that the Company purchasesfor manufacturing operations and many of the products that it sells are sourced from a wide variety of third-party suppliers. TheCompany cannot control the supply, design, function or cost of many of the products that are offered for sale and are dependenton the availability and pricing of key materials and products. Disruptions in the availability of raw materials used in productionof these products may adversely affect sales and result in customer dissatisfaction. In addition, global sourcing of many of theproducts sold is an important factor in the Company’s financial performance. The ability to find qualified suppliers andto access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced outsidethe United States. Political instability, financial instability of suppliers, merchandise quality issues, trade restrictions, tariffs,currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, inflation and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond the Company’scontrol. Historically,instability in the political and economic environments of the countries in which the Company or its suppliers obtain products andraw materials has not had a material adverse effect on operations. However, the Company cannot predict the effect that future changesin economic or political conditions in such foreign countries may have on operations. In the event of disruptions or delays insupply due to economic or political conditions in foreign countries, such disruptions or delays could adversely affect resultsof operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements could be made. In addition, products and materials purchased fromalternative sources may be of lesser quality or more expensive than the products and materials currently purchased abroad. Deteriorationin relationships with suppliers or in the financial condition of suppliers could adversely affect liquidity, results of operationsand financial position. Access to materials,parts and supplies is dependent upon close relationships with suppliers and the ability to purchase products from the principalsuppliers on competitive terms. The Company does not enter into long-term supply contracts with these suppliers, and has no currentplans to do so in the future. These suppliers are not required to sell to the Company and are free to change the prices and otherterms. Any deterioration or change in the relationships with or in the financial condition of the Company’s significant supplierscould have an adverse impact on its ability to procure materials and parts necessary to produce products for sale and distribution.If any of the significant suppliers terminated or significantly curtailed its relationship with the Company or ceased operations,the Company would be forced to expand relationships with other suppliers, seek out new relationships with new suppliers or riska loss in market share due to diminished product offerings and availability. Any change in one or more of these suppliers’willingness or ability to continue to supply the Company with their products could have an adverse impact on the Company’sliquidity, results of operations and financial position. Disruptionsto our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our operations. Many of the Company’sproducts are manufactured outside the United States. Those products must be transported by third parties over large geographicdistances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products could occur due to work stoppages, port strikes, lack of availabilityof transportation, and other factors beyond the Company’s control. Such delays could impair our ability to timely and efficientlydeliver our products, and could adversely impact our operating results. The Company may be subject to productwarranty claims that require the replacement or repair of the product sold. Such warranty claims could adversely affect the Company’sfinancial position and relationships with its customers.  The Company manufactures and/or distributesa variety of products. From time to time, such products may contain manufacturing defects or design flaws that are not detectedprior to sale, particularly as to new product introductions or upon design changes to existing products. The failure to identifyand correct manufacturing defects and product design issues prior to the sale of those products could result in product warrantyclaims that result in costs to replace or repair any such defective products. Because many of the Company’s products aresold to retailers for broad consumer distribution and/or to customers who buy in large quantities, the costs associated with productwarranty claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial position. Productwarranty claims also could cause customer dissatisfaction that may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s reputationand on the Company’s relationships with its customers, which may result in lost or reduced sales. 8  The Companymay be subject to various types of litigation and the Company’s insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages relatedto those claims.     From time to timethe Company or its subsidiaries may be involved in lawsuits or other claims arising in the course of business, including thoserelated to product liability, consumer protection, employment, intellectual property, torts and other matters, In addition, itmay be subject to lawsuits relating to the design, manufacture or distribution of its products. The Company may be subject to lawsuitsresulting from injuries associated with the use of sporting goods equipment that it sells and information security and print finishingproducts that it sold prior to divesting that business. The Company may incur losses relating to these claims or the defense ofthese claims. There is a risk that claims or liabilities will exceed the Company’s insurance coverage. In addition, the Companymay be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future. Further, the Company is subject to regulation by the ConsumerProduct Safety Commission and similar state regulatory agencies. If the Company fails to comply with government and industry safetystandards, it may be subject to claims, lawsuits, fines, product recalls and adverse publicity that could have a material adverseeffect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Intellectual property rights arevaluable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of products. The Company obtainspatents, trademarks and copyrights for intellectual property, which represent important assets to the Company. If the Company failsto adequately protect intellectual property through patents, trademarks and copyrights, its intellectual property rights may bemisappropriated by others, invalidated or challenged, and our competitors could duplicate the Company’s products or may otherwiselimit any competitive design or manufacturing advantages. The Company believes that success is likely to depend upon continuedinnovation, technical expertise, marketing skills and customer support and services rather than on legal protection of intellectualproperty rights. However, the Company intends to aggressively assert its intellectual property rights when necessary. The Companyis subject to risks associated with laws and regulations related to health, safety and environmental protection. Products, andthe production and distribution of products, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmentalprotection. Laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmental protection have been passed in several jurisdictionsin which the Company operates in the United States and abroad. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effectsbased on the nature of operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will nothave a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. International operations expose theCompany to the unique risks inherent in foreign operations. The Companyhas operations in Mexico. Foreign operations encounter risks similar to those faced by U.S. operations, as well as risks inherentin foreign operations, such as local customs and regulatory constraints, control over product quality and content, foreign tradepolicies, competitive conditions, foreign currency fluctuations and unstable political and economic conditions. The Company’sbusiness relationships in Asia further increase its exposure to these foreign operating risks, which could have an adverse impacton the Company’s income and profitability. The Company could be adversely affectedby changes in currency exchange rates and/or the value of the United States dollar. The Company is exposed to risks relatedto the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the value of the United States dollar. Changes in currency exchangerates and the value of the United States dollar can have a significant impact on earnings. While the Company carefully watchesfluctuations in currency exchange rates, these types of changes can have material adverse effects on the Company’s business,results of operations and financial condition. 9  Failure to improve and maintain thequality of internal controls over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the ability to provide timely and accuratefinancial information, which could harm the Company’s reputation and share price. Management is responsible for establishingand maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting for the Company to provide reasonable assurance regarding thereliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accountingprinciples. Management cannot be certain that weaknesses and deficiencies in internal controls will not arise or be identifiedor that the Company will be able to correct and maintain adequate controls over financial processes and reporting in the future.Any failure to maintain adequate controls or to adequately implement required new or improved controls could harm operating resultsor cause failure to meet reporting obligations in a timely and accurate manner. Ineffective internal controls over financial reportingcould also cause investors to lose confidence in reported financial information, which could adversely affect the trading priceof the Company’s common stock. Disclosure controls and procedures aredesigned to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, management, including the Chief Executive Officerand Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A controlsystem, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives ofthe control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems,no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Failure to effectively implementthe Company’s global integrated information system could cause incorrect information or delays in getting information whichcould adversely affect the performance of the Company. The Company is in the process of convertingits Enterprise Risk Planning (ERP) systems from legacy systems to Epicor. Implementation has been completed for Raleigh, NorthCarolina, and Rosarito, Mexico locations. The Company intends to complete the conversion of its remaining sites over the next twoyears. There can be no assurance the Company will have the necessary funds or the staff to fully avail itself of the control featuresinherent in the system design. Without such utility, the Company management is faced with legacy systems and time consuming effortsto manually consolidate its financial information. Problems with the Company’sinformation system software or hardware could disrupt operations and negatively impact financial results and materially adverselyaffect the Company’s business operations  The Company relies on a suite of applicationsand third party software to receive and process customer orders and for the core of its manufacturing, distribution, and accountingsystems. These systems, if not functioning properly, could disrupt its operations, including the Company’s ability to receiveand ship orders and to process financial information or engage in similar normal business activities. Any material disruption,malfunction or other similar problems in or with these systems could negatively impact our financial results and materially adverselyaffect our business operations. The preparation of the Company’sfinancial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results. The preparation of consolidated financialstatements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make significantestimates that may affect financial statements. Due to the inherent nature of making estimates, actual results may vary substantiallyfrom such estimates, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financialcondition. For more information on the Company’s critical accounting estimates, please see the Critical Accounting Estimatessection of this Form 10-K. 10  Changes in accounting standards couldimpact reported earnings and financial condition. The accounting standard setters, includingthe Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, periodically change the financial accountingand reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. These changes canbe hard to predict and apply and can materially affect how the Company records and reports its financial condition and resultsof operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, which may resultin the restatement of prior period financial statements. The Company’seffective tax rate may fluctuate. The Company is a multi-channel providerof sporting goods and, until October 2014, was a multi-national, multi-channel provider of information security and print finishingproducts. As a result, the Company’s effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the variouscountries, states and other jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The effective tax rate may be lower or higher than itstax rates have been in the past due to numerous factors, including the sources of income, any agreement with taxing authoritiesin various jurisdictions, the tax filing positions taken in various jurisdictions and changes in the political environment in thejurisdictions in which the Company operates. The Company bases estimates of an effective tax rate at any given point in time upona calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to the Company and to estimates of the amount of business likely to be done in anygiven jurisdiction. The loss of one or more agreements with taxing jurisdictions, a change in the mix of business from year toyear and from country to country, changes in rules related to accounting for income taxes, changes in tax laws and any of the multiplejurisdictions in which the Company operates, or adverse outcomes from tax audits that the Company may be subject to in any of thejurisdictions in which the Company operates, could result in an unfavorable change in the effective tax rate which could have anadverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The market price of the Company’scommon stock is likely to be highly volatile as the stock market in general can be highly volatile. The public trading of the Company’scommon stock is based on many factors which could cause fluctuation in the Company’s stock price. These factors may include,among other things: ·General economic and marketconditions;·Actual or anticipated variationsin quarterly operating results;·Limited research coverageby securities analysts;·Relatively low market capitalizationresulting in low trading volume in the Company’s stock;·If securities analysts providecoverage, our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts' estimates or expectations;·Conditions or trends inthe Company’s industries;·Changes in the market valuationsof other companies in the Company’s industries;·Announcements by the Companyor the Company’s competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategicinitiatives;·Capital commitments;·Additions or departuresof key personnel; ·Sales and repurchases ofthe Company’s common stock; and·The ability to maintainlisting of the Company’s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market. Many of thesefactors are beyond the Company’s control. These factors may cause the market price of the Company’s common stock todecline, regardless of operating performance. 11  If we are unable to pay quarterlydividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.  Our quarterly cash dividend is currently$0.10 per common share. The dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow. Our ability to pay dividends willdepend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic,financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our Board of Directors (Board) may, at its discretion, increaseor decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Any failure to pay dividendsafter we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impactour stock price. Unauthorizeddisclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information could harm the Company’s business and its standing with itscustomers. Through sales and marketing activities,the Company collects and stores certain information that customers provide to purchase products or services or otherwise communicateand interact with the Company. Despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, the Company cannot be certainthat all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate the Company’snetwork security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer or business information. In addition, an employee, acontractor or other third party with whom the Company does business may attempt to circumvent the Company’s security measuresin order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Loss of customer or business informationcould disrupt operations, damage the Company’s reputation, and expose the Company to claims from customers, financial institutions,payment card associations and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, resultsof operations and financial condition. In addition, compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standardsmay result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. Terroristattacks, acts of war or natural disaster may seriously harm the Company’s business. Among the chiefuncertainties facing the nation and the world and, as a result, the business is the instability and conflict in the Middle East.Obviously, no one can predict with certainty what the overall economic impact will be as a result of these circumstances. Terroristattacks may cause damage or disruption to the Company, employees, facilities and customers, which could significantly impact netsales, costs and expenses and financial condition. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and international responsesto terrorist attacks, and other acts of war and hostility may cause greater uncertainty and cause business to suffer in ways theCompany currently cannot predict. In addition, anynatural disaster or other serious disruption to one of the Company’s manufacturing or distribution sights due to fire, tornado,earthquake or any other causes could damage a material portion of inventory or impair our ability to provide product to our customersand could negatively affect our sales and profitability. These risks are not exhaustive.  Other sections of this Form 10-K may includeadditional factors which could adversely impact the Company’s business and financial performance. Moreover, the Company operatesin a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for managementto predict all risk factors, nor can the Company assess the impact of all factors on business or the extent to which any factor,or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction ofactual results. "
4,ESCA,ESCALADE INC,2014-02-25,"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORS   Operating results may be impacted by changes in the economy that influence business and consumer spending. Operating results are directly impacted by the health of the North American and to a lesser extent, European and Asian economies. While the global economy is experiencing some level of recovery from the recent downturn, we cannot predict how robust the recovery will be or whether or not it will be sustained.  If the economic recovery slows, or if the economy experiences a prolonged period of decelerating or negative growth, the Company’s results of operations may be negatively impacted.  In general, the Company’s sales depend on discretionary spending by consumers.  Business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions, including unemployment levels, energy costs, interest rates, recession, inflation, the impact of natural disasters and terrorist activities, and other matters that influence business and consumer spending.  Fluctuation in economic conditions could prevent the Company from accurately forecasting demand for its products which could adversely affect its operating results or market share. Fluctuation in  economic conditions and market instability in the United States and globally makes it difficult for the Company, customers and suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause the Company to produce excess products that can increase inventory carrying costs and result in obsolete inventory.  Alternatively, this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortage of products, or materials used in products, that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for products and a loss of market share. Sales declines and operating losses in the Information Security and Print Finishing segment could continue. Declines in overall sales in Information Security and Print Finishing and increases in losses in this segment are due mainly to intense competition and changes in market demand.  Continued weakness in the global office products channel and the government sales channel primarily in the United States and the United Kingdom and prolonged economic weakness in Spain and certain other European countries continue to provide challenges.  Improving profitability in the Information Security and Print Finishing segment continues to be difficult and the Company is continuing to explore the strategic fit of Information Security and Print Finishing with the Company’s overall objectives.  The Company cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to maintain or increase sales levels or achieve profitability in the future. Markets are highly competitive which could limit the Company’s growth and reduce profitability. The market for sporting goods and information security and print finishing products is highly fragmented and intensely competitive.  A majority of the Company’s products are in markets that are experiencing low growth rates.  Escalade competes with a variety of regional, national and international manufacturers for customers, employees, products, services and other important aspects of the business.  In Sporting Goods, the Company has historically sold a large percentage of its sporting goods products to mass merchandisers and has increasingly attempted to expand sales to specialty retailer and dealer markets.  Similarly, the Company has traditionally sold information security and print finishing products to office products retailers, specialty machine dealers and government channels.  In addition to competition for sales into those distribution channels, vendors also must compete in sporting goods with large format sporting goods stores, traditional sporting goods stores and chains, warehouse clubs, discount stores and department stores, and in information security and print finishing products with office supply superstores, computer and electronics superstores, contract stationers, and others.  Competition from on-line retailers may also impact sales.  Some of the current and potential competitors are larger than Escalade and have substantially greater financial resources that may be devoted to sourcing, promoting and selling their products, and may discount prices more heavily than the Company can afford.     6  If the Company is unable to predict or effectively react to changes in consumer demand, it may lose customers and sales may decline. Success depends in part on the ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand and preferences regarding sporting goods and information security and print finishing products.  Products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change.  The Company often makes commitments to manufacture products months in advance of the proposed delivery to customers.  If Escalade misjudges the market for products, sales may decline significantly.  The Company may have to take significant inventory markdowns on unpopular products that are overproduced and/or miss opportunities for other products that may rise in popularity, both of which could have a negative impact on profitability.  A major shift in consumer demand away from sporting goods or information security and print finishing products could also have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.  The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a few significant customers and loss of any of these customers could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.   The Company has one major customer which accounted for more ten percent of consolidated gross sales and several other large customers, none of which represent more than ten percent of consolidated gross sales, and historically has derived substantial revenues from these customers.  The Company needs to continue to expand its customer base to minimize the effects of the loss of any single customer in the future.  If sales to one or more of the large customers would be lost or materially reduced, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to replace such revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.   Quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation. Operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, and the Company expects that they will continue to do so in the future.  Factors that could cause these quarterly fluctuations include the following:  international, national and local general economic and market conditions; the size and growth of the overall Sporting Goods and Information Security and Print Finishing  markets; intense competition among manufacturers, marketers, distributors and sellers of products; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of products and sports; seasonal demand for products; the size, timing and mix of purchases of products; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; ability to sustain, manage or forecast growth and inventories; new product development and introduction; ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; performance and reliability of products;  customer service; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors; business disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without limitation: exchange rates, import duties, tariffs, quotas and political and economic instability; changes in government regulations; any liability and other claims asserted against the Company; ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and any other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company may pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures, or investments and the failure of a strategic transaction to produce anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate an acquired company could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business. In the past, the Company has made acquisitions of complementary companies or businesses, which have been part of the strategic plan, and may continue to pursue acquisitions in the future from time to time. Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, and may result in the diversion of capital and management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities. The Company may not be able to successfully integrate operations that it acquires, including personnel, financial systems, distribution, and operating procedures. If the Company fails to successfully integrate acquisitions, the Company’s business could suffer. In addition, acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expense or write-offs of goodwill or other intangibles, any of which could affect the Company’s financial position. The Company also has sometimes divested or discontinued certain operations, assets, and products that did not perform to the Company’s expectations or no longer fit with the Company’s strategic objectives. Escalade will consider acquisitions, divestitures, and investments in the future, one or more of which, individually or in the aggregate, could be material to the Company’s overall business, operations or financial position.   7  Growth may strain resources, which could adversely affect the Company’s business and financial performance. The Company has grown in the past through strategic acquisitions.  Growth places additional demands on management and operational systems.  If the Company is not successful in continuing to support operational and financial systems, expanding the management team and increasing and effectively managing customers and suppliers, growth may result in operational inefficiencies and ineffective management of the Company’s business, which could adversely affect its business and financial performance.  The Company’s ability to operate and expand business and to respond to changing business and economic conditions will be dependent upon the availability of adequate capital.  The rate of expansion will also depend on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn will depend in large part on cash flow generated by the business and the availability of equity and debt capital.  The Company can make no assurances that it will be able to obtain equity or debt capital on acceptable terms or at all.  Our current senior secured revolving credit facility contains provisions that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or make substantial asset sales, which might otherwise be used to finance our operations.  In the event of our insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, the lenders under our senior secured revolving credit facility would be entitled to payment in full from our assets before distributions, if any, to our stockholders.    The Company’s business may be adversely affected by the actions of and risks associated with third-party suppliers. The raw materials that the Company purchases for manufacturing operations and many of the products that it sells are sourced from a wide variety of third-party suppliers.  The Company cannot control the supply, design, function or cost of many of the products that are offered for sale and are dependent on the availability and pricing of key materials and products.  Disruptions in the availability of raw materials used in production of these products may adversely affect sales and result in customer dissatisfaction.  In addition, global sourcing of many of the products sold is an important factor in the Company’s financial performance.  The ability to find qualified suppliers and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced outside the United States.  Political instability, financial instability of suppliers, merchandise quality issues, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, inflation and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond the Company’s control.  Historically, instability in the political and economic environments of the countries in which the Company or its suppliers obtain products and raw materials has not had a material adverse effect on operations.  However, the Company cannot predict the effect that future changes in economic or political conditions in such foreign countries may have on operations.  In the event of disruptions or delays in supply due to economic or political conditions in foreign countries, such disruptions or delays could adversely affect results of operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements could be made.  In addition, products and materials purchased from alternative sources may be of lesser quality or more expensive than the products and materials currently purchased abroad.  Deterioration in relationships with suppliers or in the financial condition of suppliers could adversely affect liquidity, results of operations and financial position. Access to materials, parts and supplies is dependent upon close relationships with suppliers and the ability to purchase products from the principal suppliers on competitive terms. The Company does not enter into long-term supply contracts with these suppliers, and has no current plans to do so in the future. These suppliers are not required to sell to the Company and are free to change the prices and other terms. Any deterioration or change in the relationships with or in the financial condition of the Company’s significant suppliers could have an adverse impact on its ability to procure materials and parts necessary to produce products for sale and distribution.  If any of the significant suppliers terminated or significantly curtailed its relationship with the Company or ceased operations, the Company would be forced to expand relationships with other suppliers, seek out new relationships with new suppliers or risk a loss in market share due to diminished product offerings and availability.  Any change in one or more of these suppliers’ willingness or ability to continue to supply the Company with their products could have an adverse impact on the Company’s liquidity, results of operations and financial position.    8  The Company may be subject to product warranty claims that require the replacement or repair of the product sold.  Such warranty claims could adversely affect the Company’s financial position and relationships with its customers.   The Company manufactures and/or distributes a variety of products in both its Sporting Goods and Information Security and Print Finishing business segments.  From time to time, such products may contain manufacturing defects or design flaws that are not detected prior to sale, particularly as to new product introductions or upon design changes to existing products.  The failure to identify and correct manufacturing defects and product design issues prior to the sale of those products could result in product warranty claims that result in costs to replace or repair any such defective products.  Because many of the Company’s products are sold to retailers for broad consumer distribution and/or to customers who buy in large quantities, the costs associated with product warranty claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial position.  Product warranty claims also could cause customer dissatisfaction that may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s reputation and on the Company’s relationships with its customers, which may result in lost or reduced sales.     The Company may be subject to various types of litigation and the Company’s insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages related to those claims.      From time to time the Company or its subsidiaries may be involved in lawsuits or other claims arising in the course of business, including those related to product liability, consumer protection, employment, intellectual property, torts and other matters, In addition, it may be subject to lawsuits relating to the design, manufacture or distribution of its products.  The Company may be subject to lawsuits resulting from injuries associated with the use of sporting goods equipment and information security and print finishing products that it sells.  The Company may incur losses relating to these claims or the defense of these claims.  There is a risk that claims or liabilities will exceed the Company’s insurance coverage.  In addition, the Company may be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future.  Further, the Company is subject to regulation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and similar state regulatory agencies.  If the Company fails to comply with government and industry safety standards, it may be subject to claims, lawsuits, fines, product recalls and adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of products. The Company obtains patents, trademarks and copyrights for intellectual property, which represent important assets to the Company.  If the Company fails to adequately protect intellectual property through patents, trademarks and copyrights, its intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others, invalidated or challenged, and our competitors could duplicate the Company’s products or may otherwise limit any competitive design or manufacturing advantages.  The Company believes that success is likely to depend upon continued innovation, technical expertise, marketing skills and customer support and services rather than on legal protection of intellectual property rights.  However, the Company intends to aggressively assert its intellectual property rights when necessary.   The Company is subject to risks associated with laws and regulations related to health, safety and environmental protection. Products, and the production and distribution of products, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmental protection.  Laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmental protection have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates in the United States and abroad.  Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.   9  International operations expose the Company to the unique risks inherent in foreign operations. The Company has operations in Mexico, Europe, South Africa and Asia.  Foreign operations encounter risks similar to those faced by U.S. operations, as well as risks inherent in foreign operations, such as local customs and regulatory constraints, control over product quality and content, foreign trade policies, competitive conditions, foreign currency fluctuations and unstable political and economic conditions.  The Company’s business relationships in Asia and the information security and print finishing international operations headquartered in Germany further increase its exposure to these foreign operating risks, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s international income and worldwide profitability.  The Company could be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates and/or the value of the United States dollar. The Company is exposed to risks related to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the value of the United States dollar.  Changes in currency exchange rates and the value of the United States dollar can have a significant impact on earnings from international operations.  While the Company carefully watches fluctuations in currency exchange rates, these types of changes can have material adverse effects on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Failure to improve and maintain the quality of internal controls over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the ability to provide timely and accurate financial information, which could harm the Company’s reputation and share price. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting for the Company to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Management cannot be certain that weaknesses and deficiencies in internal controls will not arise or be identified or that the Company will be able to correct and maintain adequate controls over financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain adequate controls or to adequately implement required new or improved controls could harm operating results or cause failure to meet reporting obligations in a timely and accurate manner. Ineffective internal controls over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in reported financial information, which could adversely affect the trading price of the Company’s common stock. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Failure to effectively implement the Company’s global integrated information system could cause incorrect information or delays in getting information which could adversely affect the performance of the Company. The Company is in the process of converting its Enterprise Risk Planning (ERP) systems from legacy systems to Epicor.  Implementation has been completed for the Information Security and Print Finishing Indiana and Germany locations and for the Sporting Goods North Carolina and Mexico locations.    The Company intends to complete the conversion of its remaining sites over the next two years.  There can be no assurance the Company will have the necessary funds or the staff to fully avail itself of the control features inherent in the system design.  Without such utility, the Company management is faced with legacy systems and time consuming efforts to manually consolidate its financial information.    10  Problems with the Company’s information system software or hardware could disrupt operations and negatively impact financial results and materially adversely affect the Company’s business operations.   The Company relies on a suite of applications and third party software to receive and process customer orders and for the core of its manufacturing, distribution, and accounting systems.  These systems, if not functioning properly, could disrupt its operations, including the Company’s ability to receive and ship orders and to process financial information or engage in similar normal business activities.  Any material disruption, malfunction or other similar problems in or with these systems could negatively impact our financial results and materially adversely affect our business operations.            The preparation of the Company’s financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make significant estimates that may affect financial statements.  Due to the inherent nature of making estimates, actual results may vary substantially from such estimates, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.  For more information on the Company’s critical accounting estimates, please see the Critical Accounting Estimates section of this Form 10-K.   Changes in accounting standards could impact reported earnings and financial condition. The accounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  These changes can be hard to predict and apply and can materially affect how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations.  In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, which may result in the restatement of prior period financial statements.  The Company’s effective tax rate may fluctuate. The Company is a multi-national, multi-channel provider of sporting goods and information security and print finishing products.  As a result, the Company’s effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries, states and other jurisdictions in which the Company operates.  The effective tax rate may be lower or higher than its tax rates have been in the past due to numerous factors, including the sources of income, any agreement with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, the tax filing positions taken in various jurisdictions and changes in the political environment in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.  The Company bases estimates of an effective tax rate at any given point in time upon a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to the Company and to estimates of the amount of business likely to be done in any given jurisdiction.  The loss of one or more agreements with taxing jurisdictions, a change in the mix of business from year to year and from country to country, changes in rules related to accounting for income taxes, changes in tax laws and any of the multiple jurisdictions in which the Company operates, or adverse outcomes from tax audits that the Company may be subject to in any of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, could result in an unfavorable change in the effective tax rate which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.  The market price of the Company’s common stock is likely to be highly volatile as the stock market in general can be highly volatile. The public trading of the Company’s common stock is based on many factors which could cause fluctuation in the Company’s stock price.  These factors may include, among other things: ·General economic and market conditions;⋅Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;   11  ·Lack of research coverage by securities analysts;⋅Relatively low market capitalization resulting in low trading volume in the Company’s stock;·If securities analysts provide coverage, our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts' estimates or expectations;⋅Conditions or trends in the Company’s industries;·Changes in the market valuations of other companies in the Company’s industries;⋅Announcements by the Company or the Company’s competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives;·Capital commitments;⋅Additions or departures of key personnel; ·Sales and repurchases of the Company’s common stock; and⋅The ability to maintain listing of the Company’s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market. Many of these factors are beyond the Company’s control.  These factors may cause the market price of the Company’s common stock to decline, regardless of operating performance.   If we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.  Our quarterly cash dividend is currently $0.09 per common share. The dividend program requires the use of a modest portion of our cash flow. Our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our Board of Directors (Board) may, at its discretion, increase or decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price.  Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information could harm the Company’s business and its standing with its customers. Through sales and marketing activities, the Company collects and stores certain information that customers provide to purchase products or services or otherwise communicate and interact with the Company.  Despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, the Company cannot be certain that all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack.  Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate the Company’s network security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer or business information.  In addition, an employee, a contractor or other third party with whom the Company does business may attempt to circumvent the Company’s security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information.  Loss of customer or business information could disrupt operations, damage the Company’s reputation, and expose the Company to claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. Terrorist attacks, acts of war or natural disaster may seriously harm the Company’s business. Among the chief uncertainties facing the nation and the world and, as a result, the business is the instability and conflict in the Middle East.  Obviously, no one can predict with certainty what the overall economic impact will be as a result of these circumstances.  Terrorist attacks may cause damage or disruption to the Company, employees, facilities and customers, which could significantly impact net sales, costs and expenses and financial condition.  The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and international responses to terrorist attacks, and other acts of war and hostility may cause greater uncertainty and cause business to suffer in ways the Company currently cannot predict.     12  In addition, any natural disaster or other serious disruption to one of the Company’s manufacturing or distribution sights due to fire, tornado, earthquake or any other causes could damage a material portion of inventory or impair our ability to provide product to our customers and could negatively affect our sales and profitability. These risks are not exhaustive.    Other sections of this Form 10-K may include additional factors which could adversely impact the Company’s business and financial performance. Moreover, the Company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors, nor can the Company assess the impact of all factors on business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. "
6,ESCA,ESCALADE INC,2013-02-26,"ITEM 1A—RISK FACTORS Sales declinesand increased losses at Martin Yale Group could continue. Declines in overall sales in InformationSecurity and Print Finishing and increases in losses by our Martin Yale Group are due mainly to high organizational costs andquality issues. In addition, continued weakness in the global office products channel and the government sales channel primarilyin the United States and the United Kingdom and prolonged economic weakness in Spain and certain other European countries continueto provide challenges. Sales in Information Security and Print Finishing may continue to decrease. Improving profitability inthe Information Security and Print Finishing segment will prove to be a challenge. The Company cannot provide any assurance thatit will be able to maintain or increase sales levels or achieve profitability in the future. 5  If the Company would lose significantcustomers in the future, the Company may have difficulty in replacing such lost revenues. The Company has one major customer andseveral other significant customers and historically has derived substantial revenues from those customers. The Company needsto continue to expand its customer base to minimize the effects of the loss of any single customer in the future. If sales toone or more significant customers would be lost or materially reduced, there can be no assurance that the Company will be ableto replace such revenues, which losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations andfinancial condition. Markets are highly competitive andthe Company may not continue to compete successfully. The market for sporting goods and informationsecurity and print finishing products is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. Escalade competes with a variety of regional,national and international manufacturers for customers, employees, products, services and other important aspects of the business.In Sporting Goods, the Company has historically sold a large percentage of its sporting goods products to mass merchandisers andhas increasingly attempted to expand sales to specialty retailer and dealer markets. Similarly, the Company has traditionallysold information security and print finishing products to office products retailers, specialty machine dealers and governmentchannels. In addition to competition for sales into those distribution channels, vendors also must compete in sporting goods withlarge format sporting goods stores, traditional sporting goods stores and chains, warehouse clubs, discount stores and departmentstores, and in information security and print finishing products with office supply superstores, computer and electronics superstores,contract stationers, and others. Competition from on-line retailers may also impact sales. Some of the current and potential competitorsare larger than Escalade and have substantially greater financial resources that may be devoted to sourcing, promoting and sellingtheir products, and may discount prices more heavily than the Company can afford. If the Company is unable to predictor react to changes in consumer demand, it may lose customers and sales may decline. Success depends in part on the abilityto anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand and preferences regarding sporting goods and informationsecurity and print finishing products. Products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predictedwith certainty and are subject to change. The Company often makes commitments to manufacture products months in advance of theproposed delivery to customers. If Escalade misjudges the market for products, sales may decline significantly. The Company mayhave to take significant inventory markdowns on unpopular products that are overproduced and/or miss opportunities for other productsthat may rise in popularity, both of which could have a negative impact on profitability. A major shift in consumer demand awayfrom sporting goods or information security and print finishing products could also have a material adverse effect on the Company’sbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. Quarterly operating results aresubject to fluctuation. Operating resultshave fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, and the Company expects that they will continue to do so in the future. Earningsmay not recover to historical levels and may fall short of either a prior fiscal period or market expectations. Factors that couldcause these quarterly fluctuations include the following: international, national and local general economic and marketconditions; the size and growth of the overall Sporting Goods and Information Security and Print Finishing markets; intense competitionamong manufacturers, marketers, distributors and sellers of products; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularityof particular designs, categories of products and sports; seasonal demand for products; the size, timing and mix of purchasesof products; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; ability to sustain, manage or forecast growth and inventories;new product development and introduction; ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; performanceand reliability of products; customer service; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors; businessdisruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; changes in business strategy or developmentplans; general risks associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without limitation: exchange rates,import duties, tariffs, quotas and political and economic instability; changes in government regulations; any liability and otherclaims asserted against the Company; ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and other factors referenced or incorporatedby reference in this Form 10-K and any other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 6  Operating results may be impactedby changes in the economy that impact business and consumer spending. In general, theCompany’s sales depend on discretionary spending by consumers. The economic downturn experienced in both the United Statesand the global economy has resulted in reduced consumer demand and reduced selling price and adversely impacted sales. A continuanceof this economic downturn could result in declines in revenues and impair growth in 2013. Severely negative economic conditionscould greatly impair the ability and willingness of consumers to buy products. Operating results are directly impacted by thehealth of the North American, European and Asian economies. Business and financial performance may be adversely affected by currentand future economic conditions, including unemployment levels, energy costs, interest rates, recession, inflation, the impactof natural disasters and terrorist activities, and other matters that influence business and consumer spending. If nationaland global financial markets do not improve, potential disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect business, includingthe availability and cost of short-term funds for liquidity requirements and ability to meet long-term commitments, which couldadversely affect results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. If internal fundsare not available from operations, the Company may be required to rely on the banking credit and equity markets to meet financialcommitments and short-term liquidity needs. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect the Company’sability to borrow pursuant to its Credit Agreement with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (Chase) or to borrow from other financial institutions.Access to funds under the Credit Agreement or pursuant to arrangements with other financial institutions is dependent on Chase'sor other financial institutions' ability to meet funding commitments. Financial institutions, including Chase, may not be ableto meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience high volumes ofborrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time. There can be no assurance that the Company would be ableto replace its current Credit Agreement on favorable terms, if at all, in the event that replacement would become necessary ordesirable. Longer term disruptionsin the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failuresof significant financial institutions could adversely affect access to the liquidity needed for business. Any disruption couldrequire the Company to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements orother funding for our business needs can be arranged. Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducingor eliminating future share repurchases, dividend payments or other discretionary uses of cash. Currentfinancial conditions in the United States and globally may have significant effects on customers and suppliers that would resultin material adverse effects on business, operating results and stock price. Current financialconditions in the United States and globally and concern that the worldwide economy may enter into a prolonged recessionary periodmay materially adversely affect customers' access to capital or willingness to spend capital on products and/or their levels ofcash liquidity with which to pay for products that they will order or have already ordered from the Company. In addition, currentfinancial conditions may materially adversely affect suppliers' access to capital and liquidity with which to maintain their inventories,production levels and/or product quality could cause them to raise prices, lower production levels or result in their ceasingoperations. Continuing adverse economic conditions in the Company’s markets would also likely negatively impact business,which could result in: (1) reduced demand for products; (2) increased price competition for products; (3) increased risk of excessor obsolete inventories; (4) increased risk of collectability of cash from customers; (5) increased risk in potential reservesfor doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable; (6) reduced revenues; and (7) higher operating costs as a percentageof revenues. 7  All of the foregoingpotential consequences of current financial conditions are difficult to forecast and mitigate. As a consequence, operating resultsfor a particular period are difficult to predict, and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of future resultsto be expected in future periods. Any of the foregoing effects could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business,results of operations and financial condition and could adversely affect stock price. Negativeeconomic conditions could prevent the Company from accurately forecasting demand for its products which could adversely affectits operating results or market share. The current negativeeconomic conditions and market instability in the United States and globally makes it increasingly difficult for the Company,customers and suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause the Company to produce excess productsthat can increase inventory carrying costs and result in obsolete inventory. Alternatively, this forecasting difficulty couldcause a shortage of products, or materials used in products, that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for productsand a loss of market share. The Companymay pursue strategic acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on its business. In the past, the Company has made acquisitionsof complementary companies or businesses, which have been part of the strategic plan and may continue to pursue acquisitions inthe future from time to time. Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, and may result in thediversion of capital and management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities. The Company may not be ableto successfully integrate operations that it acquires, including personnel, financial systems, distribution, and operating procedures.If the Company fails to successfully integrate acquisitions, the Company’s business could suffer. In addition, the integrationof any acquired business, and its financial results, may adversely affect operating results. Escalade will consider acquisitionsin the future, but the Company currently does not have any agreements with respect to any such acquisitions. Growth may strain resources, whichcould adversely affect the Company’s business and financial performance. Both the Sporting Goods and InformationSecurity and Print Finishing businesses have grown in the past through strategic acquisitions. Growth places additional demandson management and operational systems. If the Company is not successful in continuing to support operational and financial systems,expanding the management team and increasing and effectively managing customers and suppliers, growth may result in operationalinefficiencies and ineffective management of the Company’s business, which could adversely affect its business and financialperformance. The Company’sability to expand business will be dependent upon the availability of adequate capital. The rate of expansionwill also depend on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn will depend in large part on cash flow generated by thebusiness and the availability of equity and debt capital. Escalade can make no assurances that it will be able to obtain equityor debt capital on acceptable terms or at all, especially considering the current disruptions in the credit markets. Failureto improve operational efficiency and reduce administrative costs could have a material adverse effect on the Company’sliquidity, financial position and results of operations.     The Company’sability to improve profit margins is largely dependent on the success of on-going initiatives to streamline infrastructure, improveoperational efficiency and the reduction of administrative costs in certain segments of the Company. Failure to continue to implementthese initiatives successfully, or the failure of such initiatives to result in improved profitability, could have a materialadverse effect on the Company’s liquidity, results of operations and financial position. 8  The Company’s business maybe adversely affected by the actions of and risks associated with third-party suppliers. The raw materials that the Company purchasesfor manufacturing operations and many of the products that it sells are sourced from a wide variety of third-party suppliers.The Company cannot control the supply, design, function or cost of many of the products that are offered for sale and are dependenton the availability and pricing of key materials and products. Disruptions in the availability of raw materials used in productionof these products may adversely affect sales and result in customer dissatisfaction. In addition, global sourcing of many of theproducts sold is an important factor in the Company’s financial performance. The ability to find qualified suppliers andto access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced outsidethe United States. Political instability, financial instability of suppliers, merchandise quality issues, trade restrictions,tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, inflation and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyondthe Company’s control. Historically,instability in the political and economic environments of the countries in which the Company or its suppliers obtain productsand raw materials has not had a material adverse effect on operations. However, the Company cannot predict the effect that futurechanges in economic or political conditions in such foreign countries may have on operations. In the event of disruptions or delaysin supply due to economic or political conditions in foreign countries, such disruptions or delays could adversely affect resultsof operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements could be made. In addition, products and materials purchased fromalternative sources may be of lesser quality or more expensive than the products and materials currently purchased abroad. Deteriorationin relationships with suppliers or in the financial condition of suppliers could adversely affect liquidity, results of operationsand financial position. Access to materials,parts and supplies is dependent upon close relationships with suppliers and the ability to purchase products from the principalsuppliers on competitive terms. The Company does not enter into long-term supply contracts with these suppliers, and has no currentplans to do so in the future. These suppliers are not required to sell to the Company and are free to change the prices and otherterms. Any deterioration or change in the relationships with or in the financial condition of the Company’s significantsuppliers could have an adverse impact on its ability to procure materials and parts necessary to produce products for sale anddistribution. If any of the significant suppliers terminated or significantly curtailed its relationship with the Company or ceasedoperations, the Company would be forced to expand relationships with other suppliers, seek out new relationships with new suppliersor risk a loss in market share due to diminished product offerings and availability. Any change in one or more of these suppliers’willingness or ability to continue to supply the Company with their products could have an adverse impact on the Company’sliquidity, results of operations and financial position. Escalade may be subject to productwarranty claims that require the replacement or repair of the product sold. Such warranty claims could adversely affect Escalade’sfinancial position and relationships with its customers. The Company manufacturesand/or distributes a variety of products in both its Sporting Goods and Information Security and Print Finishing business segments.From time to time, such products may contain manufacturing defects or design flaws that are not detected prior to sale, particularlyas to new product introductions or upon design changes to existing products. The failure to identify and correct manufacturingdefects and product design issues prior to the sale of those products could result in product warranty claims that result in coststo replace or repair any such defective products. Because many of the Company’s products are sold to retailers for broadconsumer distribution and/or to customers who buy in large quantities, the costs associated with product warranty claims couldhave a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial position. Product warranty claims alsocould cause customer dissatisfaction that may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s reputation and on the Company’srelationships with its customers, which may result in lost or reduced sales. 9  Escalademay be subject to product liability claims and the Company’s insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages related tothose claims.     The Company maybe subject to lawsuits resulting from injuries associated with the use of sporting goods equipment and information security andprint finishing products that it sells. The Company may incur losses relating to these claims or the defense of these claims.There is a risk that claims or liabilities will exceed the Company’s insurance coverage. In addition, the Company may beunable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future. Further, the Company is subject to regulation by the Consumer ProductSafety Commission and similar state regulatory agencies. If the Company fails to comply with government and industry safety standards,it may be subject to claims, lawsuits, fines, product recalls and adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effecton the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Intellectual property rights arevaluable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of products. The Company obtainspatents, trademarks and copyrights for intellectual property, which represent important assets to the Company. If the Companyfails to adequately protect intellectual property through patents, trademarks and copyrights, its intellectual property rightsmay be misappropriated by others, invalidated or challenged, and our competitors could duplicate the Company’s productsor may otherwise limit any competitive design or manufacturing advantages. The Company believes that success is likely to dependupon continued innovation, technical expertise, marketing skills and customer support and services rather than on legal protectionof intellectual property rights. However, the Company intends to aggressively assert its intellectual property rights when necessary. The Companyis subject to risks associated with laws and regulations related to health, safety and environmental protection. Products, andthe production and distribution of products, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmentalprotection. Laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmental protection have been passed in several jurisdictionsin which the Company operates in the United States and abroad. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effectsbased on the nature of operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will nothave a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. International operations exposethe Company to the unique risks inherent in foreign operations. The Company has operations in Mexico,Europe, S. Africa and Asia. Foreign operations encounter risks similar to those faced by U.S. operations, as well as risks inherentin foreign operations, such as local customs and regulatory constraints, control over product quality and content, foreign tradepolicies, competitive conditions, foreign currency fluctuations and unstable political and economic conditions. The Company’sinternational operations headquartered in Germany and its business relationships in Asia further increase its exposure to theseforeign operating risks, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s international income and worldwide profitability. The Company could be adversely affectedby changes in currency exchange rates and/or the value of the United States dollar. The Company is exposed to risks relatedto the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the value of the United States dollar. Changes in currency exchangerates and the value of the United States dollar can have a significant impact on earnings from international operations. Whilethe Company carefully watches fluctuations in currency exchange rates, these types of changes can have material adverse effectson the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. 10  Failure to improve and maintainthe quality of internal controls over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the ability to provide timelyand accurate financial information, which could harm the Company’s reputation and share price. Management is responsible for establishingand maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting for the Company to provide reasonable assurance regardingthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accountingprinciples. Management cannot be certain that weaknesses and deficiencies in internal controls will not arise or be identifiedor that the Company will be able to correct and maintain adequate controls over financial processes and reporting in the future.Any failure to maintain adequate controls or to adequately implement required new or improved controls could harm operating resultsor cause failure to meet reporting obligations in a timely and accurate manner. Ineffective internal controls over financial reportingcould also cause investors to lose confidence in reported financial information, which could adversely affect the trading priceof the Company’s common stock. Disclosure controls and procedures aredesigned to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, management, including the Chief Executive Officerand Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. Acontrol system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectivesof the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems,no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Failure to effectively implementthe Company’s global integrated information system could cause incorrect information or delays in getting information whichcould adversely affect the performance of the Company. The Company is in the process of convertingits U.S. Enterprise Risk Planning (ERP) systems from legacy systems to Epicor. The Martin Yale North America location was convertedat the beginning of 2011; the Escalade Sports North Carolina location at the beginning of 2012 and the Martin Yale International,Germany location at the beginning of the third quarter of 2012. The Company intends to complete the conversion of its remainingSports sites over the next two years. There can be no assurance the Company will have the necessary funds or the staff to fullyavail itself of the control features inherent in the system design. Without such utility, the Company management is faced withcumbersome and time consuming efforts to manually consolidate its financial information. The preparation of the Company’sfinancial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results. The preparation of consolidated financialstatements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make significantestimates that may affect financial statements. Due to the inherent nature of making estimates, actual results may vary substantiallyfrom such estimates, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financialcondition. For more information on the Company’s critical accounting estimates, please see the Critical Accounting Estimatessection of this Form 10-K. Changes in accounting standardscould impact reported earnings and financial condition. The accountingstandard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the International Accounting Standards Board, the Securitiesand Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, periodically change the financial accounting and reportingstandards that govern the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predictand apply and can materially affect how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. Insome cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, which may result in the restatementof prior period financial statements. 11  Effectivetax rate may fluctuate. The Company is a multi-national, multi-channelprovider of sporting goods and information security and print finishing products. As a result, the Company’s effective taxrate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries, states and other jurisdictions in which theCompany operates. The effective tax rate may be lower or higher than its tax rates have been in the past due to numerous factors,including the sources of income, any agreement with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, the tax filing positions takenin various jurisdictions and changes in the political environment in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The Companybases estimates of an effective tax rate at any given point in time upon a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to the Companyand to estimates of the amount of business likely to be done in any given jurisdiction. The loss of one or more agreements withtaxing jurisdictions, a change in the mix of business from year to year and from country to country, changes in rules relatedto accounting for income taxes, changes in tax laws and any of the multiple jurisdictions in which the Company operates, or adverseoutcomes from tax audits that the Company may be subject to in any of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, could resultin an unfavorable change in the effective tax rate which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business and resultsof operations. The market price of Escalade’scommon stock is likely to be highly volatile as the stock market in general can be highly volatile. The public trading of Escalade’scommon stock is based on many factors, which could cause fluctuation in the Company’s stock price.

These factors may cause the market price of the Company’s common stock todecline, regardless of operating performance. If we are unable to pay quarterlydividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed. Our quarterlycash dividend is currently $0.08 per common share. The dividend program requires the use of a modest portion of our cash flow.Our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. Thisability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our Board ofDirectors (“Board”) may, at its discretion, decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the paymentof dividends at any time. Any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact ourreputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price. 12  Informationsecurity may be compromised. Through sales and marketing activities,the Company collects and stores certain information that customers provide to purchase products or services or otherwise communicateand interact with the Company. Despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, the Company cannot be certainthat all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate the Company’snetwork security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer or business information. In addition, an employee, acontractor or other third party with whom the Company does business may attempt to circumvent the Company’s security measuresin order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Loss of customer or business informationcould disrupt operations, damage the Company’s reputation, and expose the Company to claims from customers, financial institutions,payment card associations and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, resultsof operations and financial condition. In addition, compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standardsmay result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. Terroristattacks or acts of war may seriously harm the Company’s business. Among the chief uncertainties facing thenation and the world and, as a result, the business is the instability and conflict in the Middle East. Obviously, no one canpredict with certainty what the overall economic impact will be as a result of these circumstances. Terrorist attacks may causedamage or disruption to the Company, employees, facilities and customers, which could significantly impact net sales, costs andexpenses and financial condition. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and international responses to terroristattacks, and other acts of war and hostility may cause greater uncertainty and cause business to suffer in ways the Company currentlycannot predict. These risks are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Form 10-K may includeadditional factors which could adversely impact the Company’s business and financial performance. Moreover, the Companyoperates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possiblefor management to predict all risk factors, nor can the Company assess the impact of all factors on business or the extent towhich any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-lookingstatements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as aprediction of actual results. "

9,ESCA,ESCALADE INC,2011-03-01,"ITEM 1A — RISK FACTORSSales at Martin Yale Group declined in 2010 and could continue to decline in 2011. Overall sales in Information Security and Print Finishing declined in 2010, as well as in 2008 and 2009. The 2010 loss is due mainly to continued weakness in the global office products channel and the government sales channel primarily in the United States and the United Kingdom and prolonged economic weakness in Spain and certain other European countries. Sales in Sporting Goods increased in 2010, reversing a decline in sales in 2006 through 2009. A significant portion of Sporting Goods 2008 and 2009 sales declines were a result of the loss of major customer. Sales in Information Security and Print Finishing may further decline in 2011 and sales in Sporting Goods may not continue to increase in 2011. Recovering or replacing these declining or lost sales will be a significant challenge. The Company cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to recover or replace all or any portion of declining or lost sales.   5   If the Company would lose significant customers in the future, the Company may have difficulty in replacing such lost revenues. The Company has several large customers and historically has derived substantial revenues from those customers. The Company needs to continue to expand its customer base to minimize the effects of the loss of any single customer in the future. If sales to one or more significant customers would be lost or materially reduced, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to replace such revenues, which losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Markets are highly competitive and the Company may not continue to compete successfully. The market for sporting goods and information security and print finishing products is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. Escalade competes with a variety of regional, national and international manufacturers for customers, employees, products, services and other important aspects of the business. In Sporting Goods, the Company has historically sold a large percentage of its sporting goods products to mass merchandisers, and has increasingly attempted to expand sales to specialty retailer and dealer markets. Similarly, the Company has traditionally sold information security and print finishing products to office products retailers, specialty machine dealers and government channels. In addition to competition for sales into those distribution channels, vendors also must compete in sporting goods with large format sporting goods stores, traditional sporting goods stores and chains, warehouse clubs, discount stores and department stores, and in information security and print finishing products with office supply superstores, computer and electronics superstores, contract stationers, and others. Some of the current and potential competitors are larger than Escalade and have substantially greater financial resources that may be devoted to sourcing, promoting and selling their products, and may discount prices more heavily than the Company can afford. If the Company is unable to predict or react to changes in consumer demand, it may lose customers and sales may decline.Success depends in part on the ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demand and preferences regarding sporting goods and information security and print finishing products. Products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. The Company often makes commitments to manufacture products months in advance of the proposed delivery to customers. If Escalade misjudges the market for products, sales may decline significantly. The Company may have to take significant inventory markdowns on unpopular products that are overproduced and/or miss opportunities for other products that may rise in popularity, both of which could have a negative impact on profitability. A major shift in consumer demand away from sporting goods or information security and print finishing products could also have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation. Operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, and the Company expects that they will continue to do so in the future. Earnings may not recover to historical levels and may fall short of either a prior fiscal period or market expectations. Factors that could cause these quarterly fluctuations include the following: international, national and local general economic and market conditions; the size and growth of the overall Sporting Goods and Information Security and Print Finishing markets; intense competition among manufacturers, marketers, distributors and sellers of products; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of products and sports; seasonal demand for products; the size, timing and mix of purchases of products; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; ability to sustain, manage or forecast growth and inventories; new product development and introduction; ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; performance and reliability of products; customer service; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors; business disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated with doing business outside the United States, including, without limitation: exchange rates, import duties, tariffs, quotas and political and economic instability; changes in government regulations; any liability and other claims asserted against the Company; ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and any other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.   6   Operating results may be impacted by changes in the economy that impact business and consumer spending.In general, the Company’s sales depend on discretionary spending by consumers. The economic downturn experienced in both the United States and the global economy has resulted in reduced consumer demand and reduced selling price and adversely impacted sales. A continuance of this economic downturn could result in further declines in revenues and impair growth in 2011. Severely negative economic conditions could greatly impair the ability and willingness of consumers to buy products. Operating results are directly impacted by the health of the North American, European and Asian economies. Business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions, including unemployment levels, energy costs, interest rates, recession, inflation, the impact of natural disasters and terrorist activities, and other matters that influence business and consumer spending. If national and global financial markets do not improve, potential disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect business, including the availability and cost of short-term funds for liquidity requirements and ability to meet long-term commitments, which could adversely affect results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. If internal funds are not available from operations, the Company may be required to rely on the banking credit and equity markets to meet financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets, as experienced during 2008 and continuing through 2010, could adversely affect the Company’s ability to borrow pursuant to its Credit Agreement with Chase or to borrow from other financial institutions. Access to funds under the Credit Agreement or pursuant to arrangements with other financial institutions is dependent on Chase’s or other financial institutions’ ability to meet funding commitments. Financial institutions, including Chase, may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience high volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time. There can be no assurance that the Company would be able to replace its current Credit Agreement on favorable terms, if at all, in the event that replacement would become necessary or desirable. Longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect access to the liquidity needed for business. Any disruption could require the Company to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged. Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing or eliminating future share repurchases, dividend payments or other discretionary uses of cash. Current financial conditions in the United States and globally may have significant effects on customers and suppliers that would result in material adverse effects on business, operating results and stock price. Current financial conditions in the United States and globally and the concern that the worldwide economy may enter into a prolonged recessionary period may materially adversely affect customers’ access to capital or willingness to spend capital on products and/or their levels of cash liquidity with which to pay for products that they will order or have already ordered from the Company. In addition, current financial conditions may materially adversely affect suppliers’ access to capital and liquidity with which to maintain their inventories, production levels and/or product quality could cause them to raise prices, lower production levels or result in their ceasing operations. Continuing adverse economic conditions in the Company’s markets would also likely negatively impact business, which could result in: (1) reduced demand for products; (2) increased price competition for products; (3) increased risk of excess or obsolete inventories; (4) increased risk of collectability of cash from customers; (5) increased risk in potential reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable; (6) reduced revenues; and (7) higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues.   7   All of the foregoing potential consequences of current financial conditions are difficult to forecast and mitigate. As a consequence, operating results for a particular period are difficult to predict, and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of future results to be expected in future periods. Any of the foregoing effects could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition and could adversely affect stock price. Negative economic conditions could prevent the Company from accurately forecasting demand for its products which could adversely affect its operating results or market share. The current negative economic conditions and market instability in the United States and globally makes it increasingly difficult for the Company, customers and suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause the Company to produce excess products that can increase inventory carrying costs and result in obsolete inventory. Alternatively, this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortage of products, or materials used in products, that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for products and a loss of market share. The Company may pursue strategic acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on its business. In the past, the Company has made acquisitions of complementary companies or businesses, which have been part of the strategic plan and may continue to pursue acquisitions in the future from time to time. Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, and may result in the diversion of capital and management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities. The Company may not be able to successfully integrate operations that it acquires, including personnel, financial systems, distribution, and operating procedures. If the Company fails to successfully integrate acquisitions, the Company’s business could suffer. In addition, the integration of any acquired business, and its financial results, may adversely affect operating results. Escalade will consider acquisitions in the future, but the Company currently does not have any agreements with respect to any such acquisitions. Growth may strain resources, which could adversely affect the Company’s business and financial performance. Both the Sporting Goods and Information Security and Print Finishing businesses have grown in the past through strategic acquisitions. Growth places additional demands on management and operational systems. If the Company is not successful in continuing to support operational and financial systems, expanding the management team and increasing and effectively managing customers and suppliers, growth may result in operational inefficiencies and ineffective management of the Company’s business, which could adversely affect its business and financial performance.The Company’s ability to expand business will be dependent upon the availability of adequate capital. The rate of expansion will also depend on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn will depend in large part on cash flow generated by the business and the availability of equity and debt capital. Escalade can make no assurances that it will be able to obtain equity or debt capital on acceptable terms or at all, especially considering the current disruptions in the credit markets. Failure to improve operational efficiency and reduce administrative costs could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity, financial position and results of operations.The Company’s ability to improve profit margins is largely dependent on the success of on-going initiatives to streamline infrastructure, improve operational efficiency and the reduction of administrative costs at every level of the Company. Failure to continue to implement these initiatives successfully, or the failure of such initiatives to result in improved profitability, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity, results of operations and financial position.   8   The Company’s business may be adversely affected by the actions of and risks associated with third-party suppliers. The raw materials that the Company purchases for manufacturing operations and many of the products that it sells are sourced from a wide variety of third-party suppliers. The Company cannot control the supply, design, function or cost of many of the products that are offered for sale and are dependent on the availability and pricing of key materials and products. Disruptions in the availability of raw materials used in production of these products may adversely affect sales and result in customer dissatisfaction. In addition, global sourcing of many of the products sold is an important factor in the Company’s financial performance. The ability to find qualified suppliers and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced outside the United States. Political instability, the financial instability of suppliers, merchandise quality issues, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, inflation and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond the Company’s control.Historically, instability in the political and economic environments of the countries in which the Company or its suppliers obtain products and raw materials has not had a material adverse effect on operations. However, the Company cannot predict the effect that future changes in economic or political conditions in such foreign countries may have on operations. In the event of disruptions or delays in supply due to economic or political conditions in foreign countries, such disruptions or delays could adversely affect results of operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements could be made. In addition, products and materials purchased from alternative sources may be of lesser quality or more expensive than the products and materials currently purchased abroad. Deterioration in relationships with suppliers or in the financial condition of suppliers could adversely affect liquidity, results of operations and financial position. Access to materials, parts and supplies is dependent upon close relationships with suppliers and the ability to purchase products from the principal suppliers on competitive terms. The Company does not enter into long-term supply contracts with these suppliers, and has no current plans to do so in the future. These suppliers are not required to sell to the Company and are free to change the prices and other terms. Any deterioration or change in the relationships with, or in the financial condition of the Company’s significant suppliers, could have an adverse impact on its ability to procure materials and parts necessary to produce products for sale and distribution. If any of the significant suppliers terminated or significantly curtailed its relationship with the Company or ceased operations, the Company would be forced to expand relationships with other suppliers, seek out new relationships with new suppliers or risk a loss in market share due to diminished product offerings and availability. Any change in one or more of these suppliers’ willingness or ability to continue to supply the Company with their products could have an adverse impact on the Company’s liquidity, results of operations and financial position. Escalade may be subject to product liability claims and the Company’s insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages related to those claims.The Company may be subject to lawsuits resulting from injuries associated with the use of sporting goods equipment and information security and print finishing products that it sells. The Company may incur losses relating to these claims or the defense of these claims. There is a risk that claims or liabilities will exceed the Company’s insurance coverage. In addition, the Company may be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future. Further, the Company is subject to regulation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and similar state regulatory agencies. If the Company fails to comply with government and industry safety standards, it may be subject to claims, lawsuits, fines, product recalls and adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.   9   Intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of products.The Company obtains patents, trademarks and copyrights for intellectual property, which represent important assets to the Company. If the Company fails to adequately protect intellectual property through patents, trademarks and copyrights, its intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others, invalidated or challenged, and our competitors could duplicate the Company’s products or may otherwise limit any competitive design or manufacturing advantages. The Company believes that success is likely to depend upon continued innovation, technical expertise, marketing skills and customer support and services rather than on legal protection of intellectual property rights. However, the Company intends to aggressively assert its intellectual property rights when necessary. The Company is subject to risks associated with laws and regulations related to health, safety and environmental protection. Products, and the production and distribution of products, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmental protection. Laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmental protection have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates in the United States and abroad. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. International operations expose the Company to the unique risks inherent in foreign operations. The Company has operations in Mexico, Europe and Asia. Foreign operations encounter risks similar to those faced by U.S. operations, as well as risks inherent in foreign operations, such as local customs and regulatory constraints, control over product quality and content, foreign trade policies, competitive conditions, foreign currency fluctuations and unstable political and economic conditions. Economic conditions and instabilities in Mexico have hampered the Company’s efforts to sell its Reynosa, Mexico facility which has been on the market since the fourth quarter of 2008. The Company’s international operations headquartered in Germany and its business relationships in Asia further increase its exposure to these foreign operating risks, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s international income and worldwide profitability. The Company could be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates and/or the value of the United States dollar. The Company is exposed to risks related to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the value of the United States dollar. Changes in currency exchange rates and the value of the United States dollar can have a significant impact on earnings from international operations. While the Company carefully watches fluctuations in currency exchange rates, these types of changes can have material adverse effects on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Failure to improve and maintain the quality of internal controls over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the ability to provide timely and accurate financial information, which could harm the Company’s reputation and share price. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting for the Company to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Management cannot be certain that weaknesses and deficiencies in internal controls will not arise or be identified or that the Company will be able to correct and maintain adequate controls over financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain adequate controls or to adequately implement required new or improved controls could harm operating results or cause failure to meet reporting obligations in a timely and accurate manner. Ineffective internal controls over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in reported financial information, which could adversely affect the trading price of the Company’s common stock. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.   10   Failure to effectively implement the Company’s global integrated information system could cause incorrect information or delays in getting information which could adversely affect the performance of the Company. The Company replaced its Enterprise Risk Planning (ERP) system with the Oracle E-Business suite at certain locations, specifically the Martin Yale North America location and one business entity within Sporting Goods. These implementations were completed as of the beginning of 2009. The Company has been in the process of re-evaluating further roll-out of the Oracle system or replacement with another system. As of the end of 2010, the Company replaced the Oracle system at Martin Yale North America and is currently assessing potential replacement of its legacy systems and the one remaining Oracle application. Should the Company decide to fully abandon the Oracle system, the remaining book value of the Oracle system of approximately $5.2 million ($3.4 million, net of tax) would be expensed over the estimated remaining economic life of the system. A decision regarding full implementation options has not been made. There can be no assurance the Company will have the necessary funds or the staff to fully avail itself of the control features inherent in the system design. Without such utility, the Company management is faced with cumbersome and time consuming efforts to manually consolidate its financial information. The preparation of the Company’s financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make significant estimates that may affect financial statements. Due to the inherent nature of making estimates, actual results may vary substantially from such estimates, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For more information on the Company’s critical accounting estimates, please see the Critical Accounting Estimates section of this Form 10-K. Changes in accounting standards could impact reported earnings and financial condition. The accounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the International Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and apply and can materially affect how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, which may result in the restatement of prior period financial statements.Effective tax rate may fluctuate. The Company is a multi-national, multi-channel provider of sporting goods and information security and print finishing products. As a result, the Company’s effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries, states and other jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The effective tax rate may be lower or higher than its tax rates have been in the past due to numerous factors, including the sources of income, any agreement with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, the tax filing positions taken in various jurisdictions and changes in the political environment in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The Company bases estimates of an effective tax rate at any given point in time upon a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to the Company and to estimates of the amount of business likely to be done in any given jurisdiction. The loss of one or more agreements with taxing jurisdictions, a change in the mix of business from year to year and from country to country, changes in rules related to accounting for income taxes, changes in tax laws and any of the multiple jurisdictions in which the Company operates, or adverse outcomes from tax audits that the Company may be subject to in any of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, could result in an unfavorable change in the effective tax rate which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.   11   The market price of Escalade’s common stock is likely to be highly volatile as the stock market in general can be highly volatile. The public trading of Escalade’s common stock is based on many factors, which could cause fluctuation in the Company’s stock price. These factors may include, among other things:   ●General economic and market conditions;  ●Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;  ●Lack of research coverage by securities analysts;  ●Relatively low market capitalization resulting in low trading volume in the Company’s stock;  ●If securities analysts provide coverage, our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts’ estimates or expectations;  ●Conditions or trends in the Company’s industries;  ●Changes in the market valuations of other companies in the Company’s industries;  ●Announcements by the Company or the Company’s competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives;  ●Capital commitments;  ●Additions or departures of key personnel;  ●Sales and repurchases of the Company’s common stock; and  ●The ability to maintain listing of the Company’s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market. Many of these factors are beyond the Company’s control. These factors may cause the market price of the Company’s common stock to decline, regardless of operating performance. Information security may be compromised. Through sales and marketing activities, the Company collects and stores certain information that customers provide to purchase products or services or otherwise communicate and interact with the Company. Despite instituted safeguards for the protection of such information, the Company cannot be certain that all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate the Company’s network security and, if successful, misappropriate confidential customer or business information. In addition, an employee, a contractor or other third party with whom the Company does business may attempt to circumvent the Company’s security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Loss of customer or business information could disrupt operations, damage the Company’s reputation, and expose the Company to claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes.Terrorist attacks or acts of war may seriously harm the Company’s business. Among the chief uncertainties facing the nation and the world and, as a result, the business is the instability and conflict in the Middle East. Obviously, no one can predict with certainty what the overall economic impact will be as a result of these circumstances. Terrorist attacks may cause damage or disruption to the Company, employees, facilities and customers, which could significantly impact net sales, costs and expenses and financial condition. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and international responses to terrorist attacks, and other acts of war and hostility may cause greater uncertainty and cause business to suffer in ways the Company currently cannot predict.   12   These risks are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Form 10-K may include additional factors which could adversely impact the Company’s business and financial performance. Moreover, the Company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors, nor can the Company assess the impact of all factors on business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. "
12,ESCA,ESCALADE INC,2010-03-05,"ITEM 1A — RISK FACTORS     Sales declined in2009 and could continue to decline in 2010. Overallsales in both sporting goods and office products declined in 2009 due mainly toconsumer uncertainty generated by the poor economy in the United States andglobally. Sales may further decline in 2010. Recovering or replacing thesedeclining or lost sales will be a significant challenge. The Company cannotprovide any assurance that it will be able to recover or replace all or anyportion of these declining or lost sales. Salesto Escalade Sports’ largest customer declined significantly in 2008 and in 2009and sales to this customer continue to be reduced. Searshistorically was one of Escalade Sports largest customers and accounted for 18%of total consolidated revenues in 2007. In 2008, sales to Sears accounted for 6%of total consolidated revenues, representing a decline of 12% from prior year.Although Escalade Sports had been a preferred supplier of sporting goodsproducts to Sears for more than 30 years and had won numerous awards from Searsfor delivering outstanding products and services, the Company never had along-term supplier contract with Sears. In 2008, Escalade Sports was unable tonegotiate satisfactory terms for continued sales of table tennis and billiardtables, which products represented approximately 50% of total sales to Sears in2007. The Company stopped supplying those products to Sears in the second halfof 2008 and did not supply those products to Sears in 2009. Although the Companyhas achieved placement with other large mass-retail customers that willpartially offset this lost business, it cannot provide any assurance that theCompany will be able to recover or replace all of these declining or lost salesto Sears. Ifthe Company would lose significant customers in the future, the Company may havedifficulty in replacing such lost revenues. TheCompany has several large customers and historically has derived substantialrevenues from those customers. The Company needs to continue to expand itscustomer base to minimize the effects of the loss of any single customer in thefuture. If sales to one or more significant customers would be lost ormaterially reduced, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able toreplace such revenues, which losses could have a material adverse effect on theCompany’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. Marketsare highly competitive and the Company may not continue to competesuccessfully. Themarket for sporting goods and office products is highly fragmented and intenselycompetitive. Escalade competes with a variety of regional, national andinternational manufacturers for customers, employees, products, services andother important aspects of the business. In sporting goods, the Company hashistorically sold a large percentage of our sporting goods products to massmerchandisers, and has increasingly attempted to expand sales to specialtyretailer and dealer markets. Similarly, the Company has traditionally soldoffice products to office products retailers and specialty machine dealers. Inaddition to competition for sales into those distribution channels, vendors alsomust compete in sporting goods with large format sporting goods stores,traditional sporting goods stores and chains, warehouse clubs, discount storesand department stores, and in office products with office supply superstores,computer and electronics superstores, contract stationers, and others. Some ofthe current and potential competitors are larger than Escalade and havesubstantially greater financial resources that may be devoted to sourcing,promoting and selling their products, and may discount prices more heavily thanthe Company can afford. Ifthe Company is unable to predict or react to changes in consumer demand, it maylose customers and sales may decline. Successdepends in part on the ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner tochanging consumer demand and preferences regarding sporting goods and officeproducts. Products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferencescannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. The Company oftenmakes commitments to manufacture products months in advance of the proposeddelivery to customers. If Escalade misjudges the market for products, sales maydecline significantly. The Company may have to take significant inventorymarkdowns on unpopular products that are overproduced and/or miss opportunitiesfor other products that may rise in popularity, both of which could have anegative impact on profitability. A major shift in consumer demand away fromsporting goods or office products could also have a material adverse effect onbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.6Quarterlyoperating results are subject to fluctuation. Operatingresults have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, and the Companyexpects that they will continue to do so in the future. Earnings may not recoverto historical levels and may fall short of either a prior fiscal period ormarket expectations. Factors that could cause these quarterly fluctuationsinclude the following: international, national and local general economic andmarket conditions; the size and growth of the overall sporting goods and officeproducts markets; intense competition among manufacturers, marketers,distributors and sellers of products; demographic changes; changes in consumerpreferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of products andsports; seasonal demand for products; the size, timing and mix of purchases ofproducts; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; abilityto sustain, manage or forecast growth and inventories; new product developmentand introduction; ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and otherintellectual property; performance and reliability of products; customerservice; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence ondistributors; business disruptions; increased costs of freight andtransportation to meet delivery deadlines; changes in business strategy ordevelopment plans; general risks associated with doing business outside theUnited States, including, without limitation: exchange rates, import duties,tariffs, quotas and political and economic instability; changes in governmentregulations; any liability and other claims asserted against the Company;ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and other factors referencedor incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K and any other filings with theSecurities and Exchange Commission. TheCompany’s Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility matures May 31, 2010 and theCompany may be unable to renew or replace this financing. TheCompany has significantly reduced the carrying value of its Credit Facilitiesfrom $46.5 million as of year-end 2008 to $27.6 million as of year-end 2009 andis and has been in compliance with all debt covenants under its Senior SecuredRevolving Credit Facility which was signed April 2009. The Company has begunpreliminary discussions regarding renewal of its Senior Secured Revolving CreditFacility and anticipates finalizing a renewal or replacement credit agreement byMay 31, 2010, although there can be no assurances that such agreement will beentered into or, if completed, that it will be executed by the loan maturitydate. Operatingresults may be impacted by changes in the economy that impact business andconsumer spending. Ingeneral, sales depend on discretionary spending by consumers. A deterioration ofcurrent economic conditions such as that experienced in both the United Statesand the global economy in 2008 and 2009 adversely impacted sales in 2009 and acontinuing economic downturn could result in further declines in revenues andimpair growth in 2010. Severely negative economic conditions could greatlyimpair the ability and willingness of consumers to buy products. Operatingresults are directly impacted by the health of the North American, European andAsian economies. Business and financial performance may be adversely affected bycurrent and future economic conditions, including unemployment levels, energycosts, interest rates, recession, inflation, the impact of natural disasters andterrorist activities, and other matters that influence business and consumerspending. Ifthe national and global financial crisis intensifies, potential disruptions inthe credit markets may adversely affect business, including the availability andcost of short-term funds for liquidity requirements and ability to meetlong-term commitments, which could adversely affect results of operations, cashflows and financial condition. Ifinternal funds are not available from operations we may be required to rely onthe banking credit and equity markets to meet financial commitments andshort-term liquidity needs. Even if the Company is able to successfully renewthe credit facility as discussed above, disruptions in the capital and creditmarkets, as experienced during 2008 and 2009, could adversely affect its abilityto borrow pursuant to the Credit Agreement with Chase or to borrow from otherfinancial institutions. Access to funds under the Credit Agreement or pursuantto arrangements with other financial institutions is dependent on Chase’s orother financial institutions’ ability to meet funding commitments. Financialinstitutions, including Chase, may not be able to meet their funding commitmentsif they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience highvolumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period oftime.7Longerterm disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty,changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures ofsignificant financial institutions could adversely affect access to theliquidity needed for business. Any disruption could require the Company to takemeasures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternativecredit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged.Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures and reducing oreliminating future share repurchases, dividend payments or other discretionaryuses of cash. Currentfinancial conditions in the United States and globally may have significanteffects on customers and suppliers that would result in material adverse effectson business, operating results and stock price. Currentfinancial conditions in the United States and globally and the concern that theworldwide economy may enter into a prolonged recessionary period may materiallyadversely affect customers’ access to capital or willingness to spend capital onproducts and/or their levels of cash liquidity with which to pay for productsthat they will order or have already ordered from the Company. In addition,current financial conditions may materially adversely affect suppliers’ accessto capital and liquidity with which to maintain their inventories, productionlevels and/or product quality, could cause them to raise prices, lowerproduction levels or result in their ceasing operations. Continuing adverseeconomic conditions in our markets would also likely negatively impact business,which could result in: (1) reduced demand for products; (2) increased pricecompetition for products; (3) increased risk of excess or obsolete inventories;(4) increased risk of collectability of cash from customers; (5) increased riskin potential reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accountsreceivable; (6) reduced revenues and (7) higher operating costs as a percentageof revenues. All ofthe foregoing potential consequences of current financial conditions aredifficult to forecast and mitigate. As a consequence, operating results for aparticular period are difficult to predict, and, therefore, prior results arenot necessarily indicative of future results to be expected in future periods.Any of the foregoing effects could have a material adverse effect on business,results of operations and financial condition and could adversely affect stockprice. Negativeeconomic conditions could prevent us from accurately forecasting demand for ourproducts which could adversely affect our operating results or marketshare. Thecurrent negative economic conditions and market instability in the United Statesand globally makes it increasingly difficult for the Company, customers andsuppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could causethe Company to produce excess products that can increase inventory carryingcosts and result in obsolete inventory. Alternatively, this forecastingdifficulty could cause a shortage of products, or materials used in products,that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for products and a loss ofmarket share. TheCompany may pursue strategic acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact onour business. TheCompany has grown in part over the years, through acquisitions of complementarycompanies or businesses, which have been part of the strategic plan and maycontinue to pursue acquisitions in the future from time to time. Acquisitionsmay result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, and may result inthe diversion of capital and management’s attention from other business issuesand opportunities. The Company may not be able to successfully integrateoperations that it acquires, including their personnel, financial systems,distribution, and operating procedures. If the Company fails to successfullyintegrate acquisitions, business could suffer. In addition, the integration ofany acquired business, and their financial results, may adversely affectoperating results. Escalade will consider acquisitions in the future, but wecurrently do not have any agreements with respect to any suchacquisitions.8Growthmay strain resources, which could adversely affect business and financialperformance. Both thesporting goods and office products businesses have grown over the past severalyears through strategic acquisitions. Growth places additional demands onmanagement and operational systems. If the Company is not successful incontinuing to support operational and financial systems, expanding themanagement team and increasing and effectively managing customers and suppliers,growth may result in operational inefficiencies and ineffective management ofthe business, which could adversely affect the business and financialperformance. Abilityto expand business will be dependent upon the availability of adequatecapital. The rateof expansion will also depend on the availability of adequate capital, which inturn will depend in large part on cash flow generated by the business and theavailability of equity and debt capital. Escalade can make no assurances that itwill be able to obtain equity or debt capital on acceptable terms or at all,especially considering the current disruptions in the creditmarkets. Failureto improve operational efficiency and reduce administrative costs could have amaterial adverse effect on liquidity, financial position and results ofoperations. TheCompany’s ability to improve profit margins is largely dependent on the successof on-going initiatives to streamline infrastructure, improve operationalefficiency and reduction of administrative costs at every level of the Company.Failure to continue to implement these initiatives successfully, or the failureof such initiatives to result in improved profitability, could have a materialadverse effect on liquidity, financial position and results ofoperations. Businessmay be adversely affected by the actions of and risks associated withthird-party suppliers. The rawmaterials that the Company purchases for manufacturing operations and many ofthe products that it sells are sourced from a wide variety of third-partysuppliers. The Company cannot control the supply, design, function or cost ofmany of the products that are offered for sale and are dependent on theavailability and pricing of key materials and products. Disruptions in theavailability of raw materials used in production of these products may adverselyaffect sales and result in customer dissatisfaction. In addition, globalsourcing of many of the products sold is an important factor in our financialperformance. The ability to find qualified suppliers and to access products in atimely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respectto goods sourced outside the United States. Political instability, the financialinstability of suppliers, merchandise quality issues, trade restrictions,tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, inflation andother factors relating to foreign trade are beyond the Company’scontrol. Historically,instability in the political and economic environments of the countries in whichthe Company or its suppliers obtain products and raw materials has not had amaterial adverse effect on operations. However, the Company cannot predict theeffect that future changes in economic or political conditions in such foreigncountries may have on operations. In the event of disruptions or delays insupply due to economic or political conditions in foreign countries, suchdisruptions or delays could adversely affect results of operations unless anduntil alternative supply arrangements could be made. In addition, products andmaterials purchased from alternative sources may be of lesser quality or moreexpensive than the products and materials currently purchasedabroad. Deteriorationin relationships with suppliers or in the financial condition of suppliers couldadversely affect liquidity, financial position and results ofoperations. Access tomaterials, parts and supplies is dependent upon close relationships withsuppliers and the ability to purchase products from the principal suppliers oncompetitive terms. The Company does not enter into long-term supply contractswith these suppliers, and has no current plans to do so in the future. Thesesuppliers are not required to sell to the Company and are free to change theprices and other terms. Any deterioration or change in the relationships with,or in the financial condition of our significant suppliers, could have anadverse impact on the ability to procure materials and parts necessary toproduce products for sale and distribution. If any of the significant suppliersterminated or significantly curtailed its relationship with the Company orceased operations, the Company would be forced to expand relationships withother suppliers, seek out new relationships with new suppliers or risk a loss inmarket share due to diminished product offerings and availability. Any change inone or more of these suppliers’ willingness or ability to continue to supply theCompany with their products could have an adverse impact on liquidity, financialposition and results of operations.9Escalademay be subject to product liability claims and the Company’s insurance may notbe sufficient to cover damages related to those claims. TheCompany may be subject to lawsuits resulting from injuries associated with theuse of sporting goods equipment and office products that it sells. The Companymay incur losses relating to these claims or the defense of these claims. Thereis a risk that claims or liabilities will exceed our insurance coverage. Inaddition, the Company may be unable to retain adequate liability insurance inthe future. In addition, the Company is subject to regulation by the ConsumerProduct Safety Commission and similar state regulatory agencies. If the Companyfails to comply with government and industry safety standards, it may be subjectto claims, lawsuits, fines and adverse publicity that could have a materialadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financialcondition. Intellectualproperty rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce thevalue of products. TheCompany obtains patents, trademarks and copyrights for intellectual property,which represent important assets to the Company. If the Company fails toadequately protect intellectual property through patents, trademarks andcopyrights, our intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others,invalidated or challenged, and our competitors could duplicate the Company’sproducts or may otherwise limit any competitive design or manufacturingadvantages. The Company believes that success is likely to depend upon continuedinnovation, technical expertise, marketing skills and customer support andservices rather than on legal protection of intellectual property rights.However, the Company intends to aggressively assert its intellectual propertyrights when necessary. TheCompany is subject to risks associated with laws and regulations related tohealth, safety and environmental protection. Products,and the production and distribution of products, are subject to a variety oflaws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmental protection.Laws and regulations relating to health, safety and environmental protectionhave been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates in theUnited States and abroad. Although the Company does not anticipate any materialadverse effects based on the nature of operations and the thrust of such laws,there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will not have a materialadverse effect on business, results of operations and financialcondition. Internationaloperations expose the Company to the unique risks inherent in foreignoperations. TheCompany has operations in Mexico, Europe and Asia.. Foreign operations encounterrisks similar to those faced by U.S. operations, as well as risks inherent inforeign operations, such as local customs and regulatory constraints, controlover product quality and content, foreign trade policies, competitiveconditions, foreign currency fluctuations and unstable political and economicconditions. The 2003 acquisition of Schleicher & Company, International AGin Germany and the Company’s business relationships in Asia have increased ourexposure to these foreign operating risks, which could have an adverse impact oninternational income and worldwide profitability. TheCompany could be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates and/orthe value of the United States dollar. TheCompany is exposed to risks related to the effects of changes in foreigncurrency exchange rates and the value of the United States dollar. Changes incurrency exchange rates and the value of the United States dollar can have asignificant impact on earnings from international operations. While the Companycarefully watches fluctuations in currency exchange rates, these types ofchanges can have material adverse effects on business, results of operations andfinancial condition.10Failureto improve and maintain the quality of internal controls over financialreporting could materially and adversely affect the ability to provide timelyand accurate financial information, which could harm the Company’s reputationand share price. Managementis responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls overfinancial reporting for the Company to provide reasonable assurance regardingthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financialstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.Management cannot be certain that weaknesses and deficiencies in internalcontrols will not arise or be identified or that the Company will be able tocorrect and maintain adequate controls over financial processes and reporting inthe future. Any failure to maintain adequate controls or to adequately implementrequired new or improved controls could harm operating results or cause failureto meet reporting obligations in a timely and accurate manner. Ineffectiveinternal controls over financial reporting could also cause investors to loseconfidence in reported financial information, which could adversely affect thetrading price of the Company’s common stock. Disclosurecontrols and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance ofachieving their objectives. However, management, including the Chief ExecutiveOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that disclosure controlsand procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, nomatter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, notabsolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further,the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resourceconstraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to theircosts. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation ofcontrols can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances offraud, if any, have been detected. Failureto effectively implement the global integrated information system (“SURGE”)could cause incorrect information or delays in getting information which couldadversely affect the performance of the Company. TheCompany began an integrated information systems evaluation process in the fourthquarter of 2007 which resulted in the selection of Oracle as its vendor. In2008, the Company spent $6.6 million establishing the foundation and network fora system wide-roll out. The project experienced some delays and the system wentlive in the North American Office Products and one business entity withinSporting Goods in the beginning of 2009. In 2009, the Company has spentadditional $0.8 million dollars. The Company is currently re-evaluating theglobal integrated information system to compare costs to fully implement andmaintain this system with purchase and implementation costs and on-goingmaintenance fees of other integrated information systems. Should the Companydecide to abandon the Oracle system, the remaining book value of the Oraclesystem of approximately $5.9 million ($3.9 million, net of tax) would beexpensed over the estimated remaining economic life of the system. A decisionregarding full implementation options has not been made. There can be noassurance the Company will have the necessary funds (estimated to be in excessof $2.0 million) or the staff to fully avail itself of the control featuresinherent in the system design. Without such utility, the Company management isfaced with cumbersome and time consuming efforts to manually consolidate itsfinancial information. Such inefficiencies and delays could cause sales andprofit to decline and/or could affect relationships with key customers and/orsuppliers. Thepreparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates that may varyfrom actual results. Thepreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accountingprinciples generally accepted in the United States and the other countries inwhich the Company does business requires management to make significantestimates that may affect financial statements. Due to the inherent nature ofmaking estimates, actual results may vary substantially from such estimates,which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, andresults of operations. For more information on our critical accountingestimates, please see the Critical Accounting Estimates section on page 23 ofthis Form 10-K.11Changesin accounting standards could impact reported earnings and financialcondition. Theaccounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board,the International Accounting Standards Board, the Securities & ExchangeCommission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, periodicallychange the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern thepreparation of our consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hardto predict and apply and can materially affect how the Company records andreports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, theCompany could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively,which may result in the restatement of prior period financialstatements. Effectivetax rate may fluctuate. We are amulti-national, multi-channel provider of sporting goods and office products. Asa result, the Company’s effective tax rate is derived from a combination ofapplicable tax rates in the various countries, states and other jurisdictions inwhich the Company operates. The effective tax rate may be lower or higher thanour tax rates have been in the past due to numerous factors, including thesources of income, any agreement with taxing authorities in variousjurisdictions, the tax filing positions taken in various jurisdictions andchanges in the political environment in the jurisdictions in which the Companyoperates. We base estimates of an effective tax rate at any given point in timeupon a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to the Company and toestimates of the amount of business likely to be done in any given jurisdiction.The loss of one or more agreements with taxing jurisdictions, a change in themix of business from year to year and from country to country, changes in rulesrelated to accounting for income taxes, changes in tax laws and any of themultiple jurisdictions in which the Company operates, or adverse outcomes fromtax audits that the Company may be subject to in any of the jurisdictions inwhich the Company operates, could result in an unfavorable change in theeffective tax rate which could have an adverse effect on business and results ofour operations. Themarket price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile as the stockmarket in general can be highly volatile. Thepublic trading of our common stock is based on many factors, which could causefluctuation in the Company’s stock price. These factors may include, among otherthings:        ●General      economic and market conditions;       ●Actual      or anticipated variations in quarterly operating  results;       ●Lack      of research coverage by securities analysts;       ●If      securities analysts provide coverage, our inability to meet or exceed      securities analysts’ estimates or expectations;       ●Conditions      or trends in our industries;       ●Changes      in the market valuations of other companies in our    industries;       ●Announcements      by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic      partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic      initiatives;       ●Capital      commitments;       ●Additional      or departures of key personnel;       ●Sales      and repurchases of our common stock; and       ●The      ability to maintain listing of the Company’s common stock on the NASDAQ      Global Market.Many ofthese factors are beyond the Company’s control. These factors may cause themarket price of the Company’s common stock to decline, regardless of operatingperformance.12Informationsecurity may be compromised. Throughsales and marketing activities, the Company collects and stores certaininformation that customers provide to purchase products or services or otherwisecommunicate and interact with the Company. Despite instituted safeguards for theprotection of such information, we cannot be certain that all of the systems areentirely free from vulnerability to attack. Computer hackers may attempt topenetrate the network security and, if successful, misappropriate confidentialcustomer or business information. In addition, an employee, a contractor orother third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent theCompany’s security measures in order to obtain such information or inadvertentlycause a breach involving such information. Loss of customer or businessinformation could disrupt operations, damage the Company’s reputation, andexpose the Company to claims from customers, financial institutions, paymentcard associations and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effecton business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition,compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards mayresult in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and thedevelopment of new operational processes. Terroristattacks or acts of war may seriously harm business. Among thechief uncertainties facing the nation and the world and, as a result, thebusiness, is the instability and conflict in the Middle East. Obviously, no onecan predict with certainty what the overall economic impact will be as a resultof these circumstances. Terrorist attacks may cause damage or disruption to theCompany, employees, facilities and customers, which could significantly impactnet sales, costs and expenses and financial condition. The potential for futureterrorist attacks, the national and international responses to terroristattacks, and other acts of war and hostility may cause greater uncertainty andcause business to suffer in ways the Company currently cannotpredict. Theserisks are not exhaustive. Othersections of this Form 10-K may include additional factors which could adverselyimpact business and financial performance. Moreover, the Company operates in avery competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge fromtime to time and it is not possible for management to predict all risk factors,nor can the Company assess the impact of all factors on business or the extentto which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results todiffer materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Giventhese risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance onforward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. "
10,ESCA,ESCALADE INC,2008-03-12,"ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORSFailure to improve and maintainthe quality of internal controls over financial reporting could materially andadversely affect the Companys ability to provide timely and accurate financialinformation about the Company, which could harm the Companys reputation andshare price. The Companys Management isresponsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls overfinancial reporting for the Company to provide reasonable assurance regardingthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financialstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.Management cannot be certain that weaknesses and deficiencies in the Companysinternal controls will not arise or be identified or that the Company will beable to correct and maintain adequate controls over financial processes andreporting in the future. Any failure to maintain adequate controls or toadequately implement required new or improved controls could harm operatingresults or cause failure to meet reporting obligations in a timely and accuratemanner. Ineffective internal controls over financial reporting could also causeinvestors to lose confidence in the Companys reported financial information,which could adversely affect the trading price of the Companys common stock.The Companys disclosurecontrols and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance ofachieving their objectives. However, Management, including the Chief ExecutiveOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that disclosure controls andprocedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matterhow well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, thedesign of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resourceconstraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to theircosts. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation ofcontrols can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instancesof fraud, if any, have been detected.Our markets arehighly competitive and we may not continue to compete successfully.The sporting goods andoffice products markets are highly competitive. We compete with a variety ofregional, national and international manufacturers for customers, employees,products, services and other important aspects of our business. Some of ourcurrent and potential competitors are larger than we are and have substantiallygreater financial resources that may be devoted to sourcing, promoting andselling their products. It is possible that increased competition or improvedperformance by our competitors may reduce our market share, profit margin andprojected operating results, and may adversely affect our business andfinancial performance in other ways.A large portionof our sales are to a major customer, the loss of which could have a materialadverse impact on the Company.Sears is our largestcustomer and accounted for 18%, 19% and 22% of our total consolidated revenuesin 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Although the Company has been a preferredsupplier of sporting goods products to Sears for more than 30 years and has wonnumerous awards from Sears for delivering outstanding products and services,the Company has never had a long-term supplier contract with Sears and does notexpect to obtain any such contract in the future. In addition, the Company hasno control over decisions made by Sears as Sears reshapes its product mix andpositioning in the consumer market in ways that have adversely affected our salesto Sears. The Company currently expects that sales to Sears in 2008 willdecline significantly and that sales to Sears may further diminish thereafter.The Company cannot provide any assurance that Sears will continue to be asignificant customer.Our business isseasonal and our annual results are dependent on the success of our second halfsales. Our Sporting Goods businessis seasonal in nature with the highest sales and operating income historicallyoccurring during the third and fourth fiscal quarters due largely to theholiday selling season. In 2007, approximately 58% of our sporting goods salescame in the second half of the year. Any decrease in our second half sales,whether because of a slow holiday selling season or otherwise, could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results forthe entire fiscal year.6We may pursuestrategic acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our business.We may from time to timeacquire complementary companies or businesses. Acquisitions may result indifficulties in assimilating acquired companies, and may result in thediversion of our capital and our managements attention from other businessissues and opportunities. We may not be able to successfully integrateoperations that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems,distribution, and operating procedures. If we fail to successfully integrateacquisitions, our business could suffer. In addition, the integration of anyacquired business, and their financial results, into ours may adversely affectour operating results. We expect to do additional acquisitions in the future,but we currently do not have any agreements with respect to any suchacquisitions. Our ability toexpand our business will be dependent upon the availability of adequatecapital. The rate of our expansionwill also depend on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn willdepend in large part on cash flow generated by our business and theavailability of equity and debt capital. We cannot assure you that we will beable to obtain equity or debt capital on acceptable terms or at all.Our growth maystrain our resources, which could adversely affect our business and financialperformance.Both our sporting goods andoffice products businesses have grown over the past several years throughstrategic acquisitions. Our growth places additional demands on our managementand our operational systems. If we are not successful in continuing to supportour operational and financial systems, expanding our management team andincreasing and effectively managing our customers and suppliers, our growth mayresult in operational inefficiencies and ineffective management of thebusiness, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Our expandinginternational operations expose us to the unique risks inherent in foreignoperations.We have operations in Mexicoand Europe, and rely on Asian suppliers for various raw materials and products.Our foreign operations encounter risks similar to those faced by our U.S.operations, as well as risks inherent in foreign operations, such as localcustoms and regulatory constraints, control over product quality and content,foreign trade policies, competitive conditions, foreign currency fluctuationsand unstable political and economic conditions. Our 2003 acquisition ofSchleicher and Company, International AG in Germany and our businessrelationships in Asia have increased our exposure to these foreign operatingrisks, which could have an adverse impact on our international income andworldwide profitability. Our business maybe adversely affected by the actions of and risks associated with ourthird-party suppliers.The raw materials that wepurchase for our own manufacturing operations and many of the products that wesell are sourced from a wide variety of third-party suppliers. We cannotcontrol the supply, design, function or cost of many of the products that weoffer for sale and are dependent on the availability and pricing of keymaterials and products. Disruptions in the availability of raw materials usedin production of these products may adversely affect our sales and result incustomer dissatisfaction. In addition, global sourcing of many of the productswe sell is an important factor in our financial performance. Our ability tofind qualified suppliers and access products in a timely and efficient manneris a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced outsidethe United States. Political instability, the financial instability ofsuppliers, merchandise quality issues, trade restrictions, tariffs, currencyexchange rates, transport capacity and costs, inflation and other factorsrelating to foreign trade are beyond our control. 7Historically, instability inthe political and economic environments of the countries in which we or oursuppliers obtain products and raw materials has not had a material adverseeffect on our operations. However, we cannot predict the effect that futurechanges in economic or political conditions in such foreign countries may haveon our operations. In the event of disruptions or delays in supply due toeconomic or political conditions in foreign countries, such disruptions ordelays could adversely affect our results of operations unless and untilalternative supply arrangements could be made. In addition, products andmaterials purchased from alternative sources may be of lesser quality or moreexpensive than the products and materials we currently purchase abroad. These and other issuesaffecting our suppliers could adversely affect our business and financialperformance.Deterioration inour relationships with our suppliers or in the financial condition of oursuppliers could adversely affect our liquidity, financial position and resultsof operations. Access to materials, partsand supplies is dependent upon close relationships with our suppliers and ourability to purchase products from our principal suppliers on competitive terms.We do not enter into long-term supply contracts with these suppliers, and wehave no current plans to do so in the future. These suppliers are not requiredto sell to us and are free to change the prices and other terms at which theysell to us. Any deterioration or change in our relationships with, or in thefinancial condition of our significant suppliers, could have an adverse impacton our ability to procure materials and parts necessary to produce products forsale and distribution. If one of these suppliers terminated or significantlycurtailed its relationship with us, or if one of these suppliers ceasedoperations, we would be forced to expand our relationship with other suppliers,seek out new relationships with other suppliers or risk a loss in market sharedue to diminished product offerings and availability. Any change in one or moreof these suppliers willingness or ability to continue to supply us with theirproducts could have an adverse impact on our liquidity, financial position andresults of operations. Our quarterlyoperating results are subject to fluctuation.Our operating results havefluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, and we expect that they willcontinue to do so in the future. Our earnings may not continue to grow at ratessimilar to the growth rates achieved in recent years and may fall short ofeither a prior fiscal period or market expectations. Factors that could causethese quarterly fluctuations include the following: international, national andlocal general economic and market conditions; the size and growth of theoverall sporting goods and office products markets; intense competition amongmanufacturers, marketers, distributors and sellers of our products; demographicchanges; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs,categories of products and sports; seasonal demand for our products; the size,timing and mix of purchases of our products; fluctuations and difficulty inforecasting operating results; our ability to sustain, manage or forecast ourgrowth and inventories; new product development and introduction; our abilityto secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property;performance and reliability of our products; our customer service; the loss ofsignificant customers or suppliers; our dependence on distributors; businessdisruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet deliverydeadlines; changes in our business strategy or development plans; general risksassociated with doing business outside the United States, including, withoutlimitation: exchange rates, import duties, tariffs, quotas and political andeconomic instability; changes in government regulations; any liability andother claims asserted against us; our ability to attract and retain qualifiedpersonnel; and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in thisForm 10-K and any other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Our operatingresults may be impacted by changes in the economy that impact business andconsumer spending.In general, our sales dependon discretionary spending by our customers. A deterioration of current economicconditions or an economic downturn in any of our major markets or in generalcould result in declines in sales and impair our growth. Accordingly, our operatingresults are directly impacted by the health of the North American, European andAsian economies. Our business and financial performance may be adverselyaffected by current and future economic conditions, including unemploymentlevels, energy costs, interest rates, recession, inflation, the impact ofnatural disasters and terrorist activities, and other matters that influencebusiness and consumer spending. 8Our failure toimprove our operational efficiency and reduce our administrative costs couldhave a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position and resultsof operations. Our ability to improve ourprofit margins is largely dependent on the success of our initiatives tostreamline our infrastructure, improve our operational efficiency and thereduction of administrative costs at every level of the Company. Our failure toimplement these initiatives successfully, or the failure of such initiatives toresult in improved profitability, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity,financial position and results of operations. Our stock pricemay fluctuate based on market expectations.The public trading of ourstock is based in large part on market expectations that our business willcontinue to grow and that we will achieve certain levels of net income. If ourquarterly financial performance does not meet market expectations, our stockprice would likely decline. Any decrease in our stock price may bedisproportionate to any shortfall in our financial performance.Our intellectualproperty rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reducethe value of our products.We obtain patents,trademarks and copyrights for our intellectual property, which representimportant assets to the Company. If we fail to adequately protect ourintellectual property through patents, trademarks and copyrights, ourintellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others, invalidated orchallenged, and our competitors could duplicate our products or may otherwiselimit any competitive design or manufacturing advantages we may have. Webelieve that our success is likely to depend upon continued innovation,technical expertise, marketing skills and customer support and services ratherthan on legal protection of our intellectual property rights. However, weintend to aggressively assert our intellectual property rights when necessary. We may be subjectto product liability claims and our insurance may not be sufficient to coverdamages related to those claims. We may be subject tolawsuits resulting from injuries associated with the use of sporting goodsequipment and office products that we sell. We may incur losses relating tothese claims or the defense of these claims. There is a risk that claims orliabilities will exceed our insurance coverage. In addition, we may be unableto retain adequate liability insurance in the future. In addition, we aresubject to regulation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and similarstate regulatory agencies. If we fail to comply with government and industrysafety standards, we may be subject to claims, lawsuits, fines and adversepublicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results ofoperations and financial condition.These risks arenot exhaustive. Other sections of this Form10-K may include additional factors which could adversely impact our businessand financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive andrapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it isnot possible for our management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assessthe impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, orcombination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially fromthose contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks anduncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-lookingstatements as a prediction of actual results"
15,ESCA,ESCALADE INC,2007-03-15,"ITEM 1A--RISK FACTORSFailure to improve and maintain the quality of internal controls over financialreporting could materially and adversely affect the Company's ability to providetimely and accurate financial information about the Company, which could harmthe Company's reputation and share price.In connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the yearended December 30, 2006, Management identified a deficiency in the internalcontrols over financial reporting relating to the calculation of income taxprovisions which rose to the level of a ""material weakness."" The errors resultedin an overstatement of income tax expense and an understatement of net income of$1.0 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and December25, 2004, respectively and an increase of $0.7 million to the December 28, 2003retained earnings balance. The financial statements for those fiscal years havebeen restated. Management cannot be certain that other deficiencies will notarise or be identified or that the Company will be able to correct and maintainadequate controls over financial processes and reporting in the future. Anyfailure to maintain adequate controls or to adequately implement required new orimproved controls could harm operating results or cause failure to meetreporting obligations in a timely and accurate manner. Ineffective internalcontrols over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidencein the Company's reported financial information, which could adversely affectthe trading price of the Company's common stock.The Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to providereasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, Management,including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expectthat disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. Acontrol system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide onlyreasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control systemare met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact thatthere are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be consideredrelative to their costs. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems,no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issuesand instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.Our markets are highly competitive and we may not continue to competesuccessfully.The sporting goods and office products markets are highly competitive. Wecompete with a variety of regional, national and international manufacturers forcustomers, employees, products, services and other important aspects of ourbusiness. Some of our current and potential competitors are larger than we areand have substantially greater financial resources that may be devoted tosourcing, promoting and selling their products. It is possible that increasedcompetition or improved performance by our competitors may reduce our marketshare, profit margin and projected operating results, and may adversely affectour business and financial performance in other ways.A large portion of our sales are to a major customer, the loss of which couldhave a material adverse impact on the Company.Sears is our largest customer and accounted for 19%, 22% and 27% of our totalconsolidated revenues in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We have been apreferred supplier of sporting goods products to Sears for more than 30 yearsand we have won numerous awards from Sears for delivering outstanding productsand services. However, we have never had a long-term supplier contract withSears and do not expect to obtain any such contract in the future. In addition,Sears continues to reshape its product mix and positioning in the consumermarket, and we have no control over decisions that could adversely affect oursales to Sears. We believe that sales to Sears will continue, but there can beno assurances that this will occur.Our business is seasonal and our annual results are dependent on the success ofour second half sales.Our Sporting Goods business is seasonal in nature with the highest sales andoperating income historically occurring during the third and fourth fiscalquarters due largely to the holiday selling season. In 2006 approximately 61% ofour sporting goods sales have come in the second half of the year. Any decrease                                       6in our second half sales, whether because of a slow holiday selling season orotherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition and operating results for the entire fiscal year.We may pursue strategic acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on ourbusiness.We may from time to time acquire complementary companies or businesses.Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, andmay result in the diversion of our capital and our management's attention fromother business issues and opportunities. We may not be able to successfullyintegrate operations that we acquire, including their personnel, financialsystems, distribution, and operating procedures. If we fail to successfullyintegrate acquisitions, our business could suffer. In addition, the integrationof any acquired business, and their financial results, into ours may adverselyaffect our operating results. We expect to do additional acquisitions in thefuture, but we currently do not have any agreements with respect to any suchacquisitions.Our ability to expand our business will be dependent upon the availability ofadequate capital.The rate of our expansion will also depend on the availability of adequatecapital, which in turn will depend in large part on cash flow generated by ourbusiness and the availability of equity and debt capital. We cannot assure youthat we will be able to obtain equity or debt capital on acceptable terms or atall.Our growth may strain our resources, which could adversely affect our businessand financial performance.Both our sporting goods and office products businesses have grown over the pastseveral years through strategic acquisitions. Our growth places additionaldemands on our management and our operational systems. If we are not successfulin continuing to support our operational and financial systems, expanding ourmanagement team and increasing and effectively managing our customers andsuppliers, our growth may result in operational inefficiencies and ineffectivemanagement of the business, which could adversely affect our business andfinancial performance.Our expanding international operations expose us to the unique risks inherent inforeign operations.We have operations in Mexico and Europe, and rely on Asian suppliers for variousraw materials and products. Our foreign operations encounter risks similar tothose faced by our U.S. operations, as well as risks inherent in foreignoperations, such as local customs and regulatory constraints, foreign tradepolicies, competitive conditions, foreign currency fluctuations and unstablepolitical and economic conditions. Our 2003 acquisition of Schleicher andCompany, International AG in Germany and our business relationships in Asia haveincreased our exposure to these foreign operating risks, which could have anadverse impact on our international income and worldwide profitability.Our business may be adversely affected by the actions of and risks associatedwith our third-party suppliers.The raw materials that we purchase for our own manufacturing operations and manyof the products that we sell are sourced from a wide variety of third-partysuppliers. We cannot control the supply, design, function or cost of many of theproducts that we offer for sale and are dependent on the availability andpricing of key materials and products. Disruptions in the availability of rawmaterials used in production of these products may adversely affect our salesand result in customer dissatisfaction. In addition, global sourcing of many ofthe products we sell is an important factor in our financial performance. Ourability to find qualified suppliers and access products in a timely andefficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goodssourced outside the United States. Political instability, the financialinstability of suppliers, merchandise quality issues, trade restrictions,tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, inflation andother factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control.Historically, instability in the political and economic environments of thecountries in which we or our suppliers obtain products and raw materials has nothad a material adverse effect on our operations. However, we cannot predict the                                       7effect that future changes in economic or political conditions in such foreigncountries may have on our operations. In the event of disruptions or delays insupply due to economic or political conditions in foreign countries, suchdisruptions or delays could adversely affect our results of operations unlessand until alternative supply arrangements could be made. In addition, productsand materials purchased from alternative sources may be of lesser quality ormore expensive than the products and materials we currently purchase abroad.These and other issues affecting our suppliers could adversely affect ourbusiness and financial performance.Deterioration in our relationships with our suppliers or in the financialcondition of our suppliers could adversely affect our liquidity, financialposition and results of operations.Access to materials, parts and supplies is dependent upon close relationshipswith our suppliers and our ability to purchase products from our principalsuppliers on competitive terms. We do not enter into long-term supply contractswith these suppliers, and we have no current plans to do so in the future. Thesesuppliers are not required to sell to us and are free to change the prices andother terms at which they sell to us. Any deterioration or change in ourrelationships with, or in the financial condition of our significant suppliers,could have an adverse impact on our ability to procure materials and partsnecessary to produce products for sale and distribution. If one of thesesuppliers terminated or significantly curtailed its relationship with us, or ifone of these suppliers ceased operations, we would be forced to expand ourrelationship with other suppliers, seek out new relationships with othersuppliers or risk a loss in market share due to diminished product offerings andavailability. Any change in one or more of these suppliers' willingness orability to continue to supply us with their products could have an adverseimpact on our liquidity, financial position and results of operations.Our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation.Our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past, andwe expect that they will continue to do so in the future. Our earnings may notcontinue to grow at rates similar to the growth rates achieved in recent yearsand may fall short of either a prior fiscal period or market expectations.Factors that could cause these quarterly fluctuations include the following:international, national and local general economic and market conditions; thesize and growth of the overall sporting goods and office products markets;intense competition among manufacturers, marketers, distributors and sellers ofour products; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularityof particular designs, categories of products and sports; seasonal demand forour products; the size, timing and mix of purchases of our products;fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; our ability tosustain, manage or forecast our growth and inventories; new product developmentand introduction; our ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents andother intellectual property; performance and reliability of our products; ourcustomer service; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; our dependenceon distributors; business disruptions; increased costs of freight andtransportation to meet delivery deadlines; changes in our business strategy ordevelopment plans; general risks associated with doing business outside theUnited States, including, without limitation, import duties, tariffs, quotas andpolitical and economic instability; changes in government regulations; anyliability and other claims asserted against us; our ability to attract andretain qualified personnel; and other factors referenced or incorporated byreference in this Form 10-K and any other filings with the Securities andExchange Commission.Our operating results may be impacted by changes in the economy that impactbusiness and consumer spending.In general, our sales depend on discretionary spending by our customers. Adeterioration of current economic conditions or an economic downturn in any ofour major markets or in general could result in declines in sales and impair ourgrowth. Accordingly, our operating results are directly impacted by the healthof the North American, European and Asian economies. Our business and financialperformance may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions,including unemployment levels, energy costs, interest rates, recession,inflation, the impact of natural disasters and terrorist activities, and othermatters that influence business and consumer spending.                                       8Our failure to improve our operational efficiency and reduce our administrativecosts could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial positionand results of operations.Our ability to improve our profit margins is largely dependent on the success ofour initiatives to streamline our infrastructure, improve our operationalefficiency and the reduction of administrative costs at every level of theCompany. Our failure to implement these initiatives successfully, or the failureof such initiatives to result in improved profitability, could have a materialadverse effect on our liquidity, financial position and results of operations.Our stock price may fluctuate based on market expectations.The public trading of our stock is based in large part on market expectationsthat our business will continue to grow and that we will achieve certain levelsof net income. If our quarterly financial performance does not meet marketexpectations, our stock price would likely decline. Any decrease in our stockprice may be disproportionate to any shortfall in our financial performance.Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect themcould reduce the value of our products.We obtain patents, trademarks and copyrights for our intellectual property,which represent important assets to the Company. If we fail to adequatelyprotect our intellectual property through patents, trademarks and copyrights,our intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others, invalidatedor challenged, and our competitors could duplicate our products or may otherwiselimit any competitive design or manufacturing advantages we may have. We believethat our success is likely to depend upon continued innovation, technicalexpertise, marketing skills and customer support and services rather than onlegal protection of our intellectual property rights. However, we intend toaggressively assert our intellectual property rights when necessary.We may be subject to product liability claims and our insurance may not besufficient to cover damages related to those claims.We may be subject to lawsuits resulting from injuries associated with the use ofsporting goods equipment and office products that we sell. We may incur lossesrelating to these claims or the defense of these claims. There is a risk thatclaims or liabilities will exceed our insurance coverage. In addition, we may beunable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future. In addition, we aresubject to regulation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and similarstate regulatory agencies. If we fail to comply with government and industrysafety standards, we may be subject to claims, lawsuits, fines and adversepublicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results ofoperations and financial condition.These risks are not exhaustive.Other sections of this Form 10-K may include additional factors which couldadversely impact our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate ina very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emergefrom time to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all riskfactors, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or theextent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual resultsto differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue relianceon forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results"
11,ESCA,ESCALADE INC,2006-03-10,"ITEM 1A--RISK FACTORSOur markets are highly competitive and we may not continue to competesuccessfully.The sporting goods and office products markets are highly competitive. Wecompete with a variety of regional, national and international manufacturers forcustomers, employees, products, services and other important aspects of ourbusiness. Some of our current and potential competitors are larger than we areand have substantially greater financial resources that may be devoted tosourcing, promoting and selling their products. It is possible that increasedcompetition or improved performance by our competitors may reduce our marketshare, profit margin and projected operating results, and may adversely affectour business and financial performance in other ways.A large portion of our sales are to a major customer, the loss of which couldhave a material adverse impact on the Company.SEARS is our largest customer, which accounted for 22%, 27% and 24% of our totalconsolidated revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. We have been apreferred supplier of sporting goods products to SEARS for more than 30 yearsand we have won numerous awards from SEARS for delivering outstanding productsand services. However, we have never had a long-term supplier contract withSEARS and do not expect to obtain any such contract in the future. In addition,SEARS continues to reshape its product mix and positioning in the consumermarket, and we have no control over decisions that could adversely affect oursales to SEARS. We believe that sales to SEARS will continue, but there can beno assurances that this will occur.Our business is seasonal and our annual results are highly dependent on thesuccess of our second half sales.Our business is highly seasonal in nature. Our highest sales and operatingincome historically occur during the third and fourth fiscal quarters, which isdue largely to the holiday selling season. In 2005, approximately 61% of oursporting goods sales has come in the second half of the year. Any decrease inour second half sales, whether because of a slow holiday selling season orotherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition and operating results for the entire fiscal year.We may pursue strategic acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on ourbusiness.We may from time to time acquire complementary companies or businesses.Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies, andmay result in the diversion of our capital and our management's attention fromother business issues and opportunities. We may not be able to successfullyintegrate operations that we acquire, including their personnel, financialsystems, distribution, operations and general store operating procedures. If wefail to successfully integrate acquisitions, our business could suffer. Inaddition, the integration of any acquired business, and their financial results,into ours may adversely affect our operating results. We expect to do additionalacquisitions in the future, but we currently do not have any agreements withrespect to any such acquisitions.Our ability to expand our business will be dependent upon the availability ofadequate capital.The rate of our expansion will also depend on the availability of adequatecapital, which in turn will depend in large part on cash flow generated by ourbusiness and the availability of equity and debt capital.
