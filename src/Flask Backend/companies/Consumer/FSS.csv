.We may occasionally make forward-looking statements and estimates such as forecasts and projections of our future performance or statements of our plans and objectives. These forward-looking statements may be contained in, but are not limited to, filings with the SEC, including this Form 10-K, press releases made by us and oral statements made by our officers. Actual results could differ materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those contained in such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the risks described below. Macroeconomic and Industry RisksOur financial results are subject to U.S. economic uncertainty and compliance with laws and regulations.In 2023, we generated approximately 78% of our net sales in the U.S. Our ability to be profitable depends heavily on varying conditions in the U.S. governmental and municipal markets, as well as the overall U.S. economy. The industrial markets in which we compete are subject to considerable cyclicality, and move in response to cycles in the overall business environment. Many of our customers are municipal government agencies, and as a result, we are dependent on municipal government spending. Spending by our municipal customers can be affected by federal, state and local political circumstances, budgetary constraints, changing priorities, actual or potential government shutdowns and other factors. The U.S. government and municipalities depend heavily on tax revenues as a source of spending and accordingly, there is a historical correlation that suggests a lag of one to two years between the condition of the U.S. economy and our sales to the U.S. government and municipalities. Therefore, downturns in the U.S. economy are likely to result in decreases in demand for our products. During previous economic downturns, we experienced decreases in sales and profitability, and we expect our business to remain subject to similar economic fluctuations in the future. In addition, the extent of any potential changes to policies, tax laws and regulations and how any such changes may impact the Company’s financial results and operations, is currently uncertain. For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has issued Pillar Two model rules introducing a new global minimum corporate tax of 15% intended to be effective on January 1, 2024. While the U.S. has not yet adopted the Pillar Two rules, various non-U.S. governments are enacting legislation. As currently designed, Pillar Two would apply to our worldwide operations. We currently do not expect these rules to materially increase our global tax costs because we do not have material operations in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the Pillar Two minimum. We continue to monitor U.S. and global legislative action related to Pillar Two for potential impacts.Government administrations and agencies, political figures, the investment community, employees and other stakeholders have had an increased focus on sustainability issues and initiatives. Regulatory and other legal changes in laws in response to such matters could require material efforts and costs by us, and our suppliers, to comply with such changes. The costs of compliance with the various laws, regulations and policies applicable to us could be significant and penalties for non-compliance could significantly impact our business.    We have international operations that are subject to compliance with domestic and foreign laws and regulations, economic and political uncertainties and conflicts and foreign currency rate fluctuations.Our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and changing international economic, legal and political conditions that are beyond our control. In 2023, approximately 22% of our net sales were to customers outside the U.S. and we expect a significant portion of our revenues to come from international sales in the foreseeable future. Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks, including the need to comply with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) Bribery Act and their counterparts in other foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, restrictive domestic and international trade regulations, and changes in these laws, regulations and policies by the U.S. and foreign governments. In addition, we may be exposed to risks and adverse economic effects associated with changes in tax laws, geopolitical conflicts, actual or threatened imposition of tariffs or trade barriers on our products or materials incorporated into our products, actual or threatened trade disputes, including so-called “trade wars,” political and economic instability in the jurisdictions in which we operate, foreign receivables collection risk and local labor market conditions. To the extent that our international operations are affected by adverse foreign economic or political conditions, we may experience disruptions and losses that could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. To mitigate the risk of foreign receivables collection, we may obtain letters of credit from international customers to satisfy concerns regarding the collectability of amounts billed to customers. Some of our contracts are denominated in foreign currencies, which may expose us to risks of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange. Changes in the value of foreign currencies over the long term could increase our U.S. dollar costs for, or reduce our U.S. dollar revenues from, our foreign operations. Any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.7Table of ContentsInflation in the United States and elsewhere could adversely affect our business.We are exposed to inflation effects, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. The United States and other jurisdictions have experienced high levels of inflation in recent years. If the inflation rate increases, it will likely affect our expenses, including, but not limited to, employee compensation and labor expenses and increased costs for supplies, and we may not be successful in offsetting such cost increases through pricing actions.The execution of our growth strategy is dependent upon the continued availability of credit and third-party financing arrangements for our customers.Economic downturns result in tighter credit markets, which could adversely affect our customers’ ability to secure financing or to secure financing at favorable terms or interest rates necessary to proceed or continue with purchases of our products and services. Further, certain government agencies, including the U.S. Treasury, have previously implemented and may continue to implement policies that have resulted and may continue to result in significantly increased interest rates and borrowing costs. Our customers’ or potential customers’ inability to secure financing for projects could result in the delay, cancellation or downsizing of new purchases or the suspension of purchases already under contract, which could cause a decline in the demand for our products and services and negatively impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.We operate in highly competitive markets.The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do. The intensity of this competition, which is expected to continue, can result in price discounting and margin pressures throughout the industry and may adversely affect our ability to increase or maintain prices for our products. In addition, certain of our competitors may have lower overall labor or material costs. In some cases, our contracts with municipal and other governmental customers are awarded and renewed through competitive bidding. We may not be successful in obtaining or renewing these contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.Strategic and Operational RisksThe inability to obtain raw materials, component parts and/or finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products.We purchase from suppliers raw materials, component parts and finished goods to be used in the manufacturing and sale of our products. In addition, we may incorporate vehicle chassis provided directly by our customers in our production process. Although the vast majority of our raw materials and component parts are sourced domestically, certain of our suppliers are based overseas, and certain of our domestic suppliers may source subcomponents from overseas. Global markets for various products and goods have suffered, and are continuing to suffer, material disruptions to certain supply chains, in part due to the coronavirus pandemic and geopolitical conflicts, including the war between Russia and Ukraine and the war between Israel and Hamas. Changes in our relationships with suppliers, shortages in availability of materials, production delays, regulatory restrictions, public health crises, labor stoppages or other supply chain disruptions, whether due to our suppliers or customers, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely manufacture and deliver products to our customers. In addition, our profit margins would decrease if prices of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods increase and we are unable to pass on those increases to our customers. Challenges within global logistics networks, including trucking and chassis shortages and shortages in labor availability, have also contributed to delays in receiving key manufacturing components, increased order backlogs and higher transportation costs. Such logistical disruption may cause us to incur higher freight costs to expedite the receipt of components from our suppliers or the delivery of products to our customers, and may also result in longer lead times for our customers.As economies around the world recovered following the most significant effects of the pandemic, sharp increases in demand created significant disruption to the global supply chain, which adversely affected our ability to receive goods on a timely basis and increased our material costs. Throughout 2023, supply chain conditions have continued to gradually improve. However, we continue to experience supply shortages and extended lead times for some components and raw materials, including certain classes of chassis and electronic components that are important to our manufacturing processes. When facing supply-related challenges, we may increase our inventory levels and purchase commitments to shorten lead times and to help maintain adequate inventory levels to meet customer expectations. While we actively monitor and take steps in an effort to mitigate supply chain risk, there can be no assurance that our ongoing mitigation plans will prevent disruptions that may arise from shortages of materials that we use in the production of our products. Global supply chain disruptions may continue to adversely affect our business and our outlook.  If we are unable to recover a substantial portion of the increase in material and transportation costs from our customers through price adjustments and/or 8Table of Contentssurcharges, our business or results of operations could be adversely affected. We may also experience an increase in order cancellations if any such pricing actions are not accepted by our customers.       Failure to keep pace with technological developments may adversely affect our operations.We are engaged in an industry that will be affected by future technological developments. The introduction of products or processes utilizing new technologies, including those resulting from any new environmental, safety and other regulations, artificial intelligence and machine learning, could require us and our suppliers to make significant changes to existing products or processes in order for them to remain marketable and competitive. Our success will depend upon our ability to source, develop and introduce on a timely and cost-effective basis new products, applications and processes that keep pace with technological developments, applicable regulations and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. We may not be successful in identifying, sourcing, developing and marketing new products, applications and processes and product or process enhancements. Further, if we implement emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning into our products and services, we may not be able to anticipate vulnerabilities, flaws or security threats resulting from the use of such technology and develop adequate protection measures. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products, applications or processes. Our products, applications or processes may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected if we or our suppliers were to incur delays in developing new products, applications or processes or product or process enhancements, or if our products do not gain market acceptance.Our efforts to develop new products and services or enhance existing products and services involve substantial research, development and marketing expenses, and the resulting new or enhanced products or services may not generate sufficient revenues to justify the expense.We place a high priority on developing new products and services, as well as enhancing our existing products and services. As a result of these efforts, we may be required to expend substantial research, development and marketing resources, and the time and expense required to develop a new product or service or enhance an existing product or service are difficult to predict. We may not succeed in developing, introducing or marketing new products or services or product or service enhancements. In addition, we cannot be certain that any new or enhanced product or service will generate sufficient revenue to justify the expense and resources devoted to the related product diversification effort.Disruptions within our dealer network or the inability of our dealers to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect our business.We rely on national and global dealer networks to market certain of our products and services. As a result, our business with respect to these products and services is influenced by our ability to manage new and existing relationships with dealers. While we have relatively low turnover of dealers, from time to time, we or a dealer may choose to terminate the relationship as a result of difficulties that our dealers experience in operating their businesses due to economic conditions or other factors. While we do not believe our business is dependent on any single dealer, a disruption in our dealer network, or with a significant dealer, or within a specific market, could have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market. In addition, our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchases of our products. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These sources of financing are vital to our ability to sell products through our dealer network. Recent significant increases in interest rates and any future deterioration in the liquidity or credit worthiness of our dealers could have a significant adverse effect on our business. From time to time, we may provide financing assistance to dealers or consider taking ownership positions. The loss or termination of a significant dealer, or a significant number of dealers, could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our products and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. We may be unsuccessful in our future acquisitions, if any, which may have an adverse effect on our business.Our long-term strategy includes exploring acquisitions of companies or businesses to facilitate our growth, enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Such acquisitions may help us expand into adjacent markets, add complementary products and services or allow us to leverage our distribution channels. In connection with this strategy, we could face certain risks and uncertainties in addition to those we face in the day-to-day operations of our business. We also may be unable to identify suitable targets for acquisition or to make acquisitions at favorable prices. If we identify a suitable acquisition candidate, our ability to successfully implement the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, especially with interest rates at comparatively high levels. In addition, our 9Table of Contentsacquisition activities could be disrupted by overtures from competitors for the targeted companies, governmental regulation and rapid developments in our industry that decrease the value of a potential target’s products or services.Acquisitions involve risks, including those associated with the following:•integrating the operations, financial reporting, disparate systems and processes and personnel of acquired companies;•managing geographically dispersed operations;•diverting management’s attention from other business concerns;•changing the competitive landscape, including disrupting existing sales channels or markets;•entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience; and•losing key employees, customers and strategic partners of acquired companies.We also may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits associated with our acquisitions. Acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of, among other things, the incurrence of debt, acquisition costs, impairment of goodwill and amortization of other intangible assets. In addition, future acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities.Businesses acquired by us may have liabilities that are not known to us.We may assume liabilities in connection with the acquisition of businesses. There may be liabilities that we fail or are unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the acquired businesses, or that may be more material than we expected. In these circumstances, we cannot assure that our rights to indemnification will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the businesses or property acquired. Further, these liabilities could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.We could incur restructuring and impairment charges as we continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure.We continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure. These actions could result in significant charges that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future actions could result in restructuring and related charges, including but not limited to impairments, employee termination costs and charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits and pension curtailments that could be significant and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.Indebtedness RiskWe are subject to a number of restrictive debt covenants.Our credit facility contains certain restrictive debt covenants and customary events of default. Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants may be affected by the other factors described in this “Risk Factors
” section, as well as other factors outside of our control. Failure to comply with one or more of these restrictive covenants may result in an event of default which, if not cured by us or waived by our lenders, allows our lenders to declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable. Such an acceleration of the maturity of our indebtedness may cause us to incur substantial costs and may prevent or limit us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions and taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. Human Capital and Labor RisksOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.Our ability to operate our businesses and implement our strategies depends in part on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. In addition, our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. The loss of the services of any key employee or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business or business prospects.10Table of ContentsAdditionally, availability of labor in the markets in which we operate has declined in recent years and competition for such labor has increased. A significant increase in wages paid by competitors for employees similar to our work force could result in insufficient availability of workers and/or increase our labor costs. In the event prevailing wage rates continue to increase in the markets in which we operate, we may be required to concurrently increase the wages paid to our employees to maintain the quality of our work force and customer service. If the supply of skilled labor is constrained or our costs of attracting and maintaining a workforce increase, our profit margins could decrease as well as our ability to maximize production and meet customer demand.Our business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters.As a portion of our workforce is unionized, we are subject to risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 9% of our U.S. hourly workers were represented by labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions. Any strikes, threats of strikes or other organized disruptions in connection with the negotiation of new labor agreements or other negotiations could materially adversely affect our business as well as impair our ability to implement further measures to reduce costs and improve production efficiencies. In addition, the stoppage of work for a prolonged period of time at one, or several, of our principal manufacturing facilities, due to public health concerns, or any other reason, could materially adversely affect our business.Our pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside of our control, including the performance of plan assets, the discount rate used to value liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory changes.Our funding obligations and pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans are driven by the performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value the plans’ liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory funding requirements. Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. In addition, a portion of our pension plan assets are invested in equity securities, which can experience significant declines if financial markets weaken. The level of the funding of our defined benefit pension plan liabilities was approximately 88% as of December 31, 2023. Funding of the Company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Our future pension expenses and funding requirements could increase significantly due to the effect of adverse changes in the discount rate, asset values or the estimated expected return on plan assets. In addition, we could become legally required to make increased cash contributions to the pension plans, and these contributions could be material and negatively affect our cash flow.Data Security and Intellectual Property RisksIncreased IT security threats, including more sophisticated cybersecurity attacks, pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and operations.We rely upon IT systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, to support a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive information relating to our businesses, customers, suppliers and employees. Sensitive information may also be stored by our vendors and on the platforms and networks of third-party providers. The secure operation of these IT systems and networks and processing and maintenance of this information is critical to the Company’s business operations and strategy. These IT systems and networks may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to hardware failures, computer viruses, cybersecurity attacks, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophic events or other factors. Further, IT security threats are growing in frequency and sophistication. Accordingly, we have implemented and continue to implement measures to address cybersecurity incidents and mitigate potential risks to our systems from these IT-related disruptions. Despite the information security measures we have taken, our systems and networks remain potentially vulnerable to cybersecurity incidents, as do those of our vendors and third-party providers. Cybersecurity incidents with respect to the Company, our vendors or our third-party providers could potentially result in the compromising of confidential information, misuse of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, misappropriation of assets or production stoppages and supply shortages, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. Although we have not suffered any significant cybersecurity incidents that have had a material business impact, we and our vendors have been the target of malicious cybersecurity threats and attacks. While various procedures and controls have been and are being utilized to mitigate IT risks, there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls that we and our third-party providers have implemented will be sufficient to protect our systems, information or other property.   11Table of ContentsInfringement of, or an inability to protect, our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, nondisclosure agreements, IT security systems, physical security and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property and the intellectual property of certain customers and suppliers. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts to protect these intellectual property rights will be sufficient. Intellectual property protection is subject to applicable laws in various jurisdictions where interpretations and protections differ or can be unpredictable and costly to enforce. Further, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain foreign jurisdictions that do not have, or do not enforce, strong intellectual property rights. Any failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.Legal and Financial RisksWe may incur material losses and costs as a result of lawsuits or claims that may be brought against us which are related to product liability, warranty, product recalls, intellectual property, client service interruptions or other matters.We are exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the normal course of business in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. For example, we have been sued by firefighters seeking damages claiming that exposure to our sirens has impaired their hearing and that the sirens are, therefore, defective. In addition, we are subject to other claims and litigation from time to time, as further described in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. We could experience material product liability or warranty costs in the future and incur significant costs to defend ourselves against these claims. While we carry insurance and maintain reserves for product liability claims, our insurance coverage may be inadequate if such claims do arise, and any defense costs and liability not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. A future claim could involve the imposition of punitive damages, the award of which, pursuant to state laws, may not be covered by insurance. In addition, warranty and certain other claims are not typically covered by insurance. Any product liability or warranty issues may adversely impact our reputation as a manufacturer of high-quality, safe products and may have a material adverse effect on our business.The costs associated with complying with environmental, safety and other regulations could lower our margins.We, like other manufacturers, continue to face heavy governmental regulation of our products, especially in the areas of the environment and employee health and safety. Increased public awareness and concern regarding climate change and other related matters at numerous levels of government in various jurisdictions may lead to additional international, national, regional and local legislative and regulatory responses, and compliance with any new rules could be difficult and costly. These regulations could include environmental requirements applicable to manufacturing and vehicle emissions and regulations impacting our supply chain both nationally and internationally. Complying with environmental, safety and other regulations has added and will continue to add to the cost of our products, could increase the capital required to support our business and could affect the products and services that we offer. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these laws and regulations, we may be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to our operations under existing laws or those that may be adopted. These requirements are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Therefore, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions as a result of violation of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and safety regulations. Further, climate change regulations at the federal, state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to limit emissions, change our manufacturing processes or product offerings, or undertake other activities which may require us to incur additional expense. These requirements may increase the cost of our products, which may diminish demand for those products. Additionally, uneven application of environmental, safety and other regulations could place our products at a cost or features disadvantage, which could reduce our revenues and profitability. An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.As of December 31, 2023, goodwill and intangible assets represented 29% and 13% of total consolidated assets, respectively. Rental equipment and properties and equipment are long-lived assets, which also collectively represented 20% of our total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2023. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Definite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, competition and market and general economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about our sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors. An impairment charge may result from, among other things, a 12Table of Contentssignificant decline in operating results, adverse market conditions, unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations, or a variety of other factors. Our total consolidated assets and results of operations for the applicable period could be materially adversely affected if any such charge is recorded"

.We may occasionally make forward-looking statements and estimates such as forecasts and projections of our future performance or statements of our plans and objectives. These forward-looking statements may be contained in, but are not limited to, filings with the SEC, including this Form 10-K, press releases made by us and oral statements made by our officers. Actual results could differ materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those contained in such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the risks described below. Macroeconomic and Industry RisksOur financial results are subject to U.S. economic uncertainty.In 2022, we generated approximately 80% of our net sales in the U.S. Our ability to be profitable depends heavily on varying conditions in the U.S. governmental and municipal markets, as well as the overall U.S. economy.

The U.S. government and municipalities depend heavily on tax revenues as a source of spending and accordingly, there is a historical correlation that suggests a lag of one to two years between the condition of the U.S. economy and our sales to the U.S. government and municipalities. Therefore, downturns in the U.S. economy are likely to result in decreases in demand for our products. Certain market factors indicate the U.S. economy may experience a significant downturn in the near future. During previous economic downturns, we experienced decreases in sales and profitability, and we expect our business to remain subject to similar economic fluctuations in the future. In addition, the extent of any potential changes to policies and regulations under the current U.S. administration, and how any such changes may impact the Company’s operations, is currently uncertain.   The extent to which the coronavirus pandemic will continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted but could be material.The coronavirus pandemic has created, and may continue to create, significant worldwide volatility, uncertainty and disruption, including substantial curtailment of business activities, slowdowns, suspensions or delays of production and commercial activity, and weakened economic conditions, both in the United States and in many foreign countries. The actual and potential impacts of the pandemic that could adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results, which could be material, will depend on numerous evolving factors, including the emergence of new variants, decreased labor availability, production delays and continued supply chain disruptions, and changes in safety protocols. Additionally, a possible recession or market correction resulting from the spread of coronavirus, or otherwise, could materially affect our business and the value of our stock.  To the extent coronavirus adversely affects our business, it may heighten other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section. We have international operations that are subject to compliance with domestic and foreign laws and regulations, economic and political uncertainties and conflicts and foreign currency rate fluctuations.Our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and changing international economic, legal and political conditions that are beyond our control. In 2022, approximately 20% of our net sales were to customers outside the U.S. and we expect a significant portion of our revenues to come from international sales in the foreseeable future. Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks, including the need to comply with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) Bribery Act and their counterparts in other foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, restrictive domestic and international trade regulations, and changes in these laws, regulations and policies by the U.S. and foreign governments. In addition, we may be exposed to risks and adverse economic effects associated with changes in tax laws, geopolitical conflicts, actual or threatened imposition of tariffs or trade barriers on our products or materials incorporated into our products, actual or threatened trade disputes, including so-called “trade wars,” political and economic instability in the jurisdictions in which we operate, foreign receivables collection risk and local labor market conditions. Further, government administrations and agencies, the investment community, employees and other stakeholders have had an increased focus on certain climate change and other environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors, issues and initiatives. Regulatory and other legal changes in laws in response to such ESG matters could require material efforts and costs by us to comply with such changes. The costs of compliance with the various laws, regulations and policies applicable to us could be significant and penalties for non-compliance could significantly impact our business.7Table of ContentsTo the extent that our international operations are affected by adverse foreign economic or political conditions, we may experience disruptions and losses that could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. To mitigate the risk of foreign receivables collection, we may obtain letters of credit from international customers to satisfy concerns regarding the collectability of amounts billed to customers.

In some cases, our contracts with municipal and other governmental customers are awarded and renewed through competitive bidding. We may not be successful in obtaining or renewing these contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.Strategic and Operational RisksThe inability to obtain raw materials, component parts and/or finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products.We purchase from suppliers raw materials, component parts and finished goods to be used in the manufacturing and sale of our products. In addition, we may incorporate vehicle chassis provided directly by our customers in our production process.

As economies around the world have recovered since the initial onset of the pandemic, sharp increases in demand have created significant disruption to the global supply chain, which has adversely affected our ability to receive goods on a timely basis and increased our material costs. Short-term or sustained increases in market demand may exceed our suppliers’ production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain. Our failure, or our suppliers’ failure, to meet the demand for raw materials and components could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 8Table of ContentsDuring 2022, our manufacturing operations continued to be adversely affected by supply chain disruptions. We are currently experiencing supply shortages and inflationary pressure for certain components and raw materials, including chassis, hydraulic pumps and electronic components that are important to our manufacturing processes. When facing supply-related challenges, we may increase our inventory levels and purchase commitments to shorten lead times and to help maintain adequate inventory levels to meet customer expectations. While we actively monitor and take steps in an effort to mitigate supply chain risk, there can be no assurance that our ongoing mitigation plans will prevent disruptions that may arise from shortages of materials that we use in the production of our products. Challenges within global logistics networks, including trucking and chassis shortages and shortages in labor availability, have also contributed to delays in receiving key manufacturing components, increased order backlogs and higher transportation costs. Such logistical disruption may cause us to incur higher freight costs to expedite the receipt of components from our suppliers or the delivery of products to our customers, and may also result in longer lead times for our customers.Uncertainties related to the magnitude and duration of global supply chain disruptions may continue to adversely affect our business and our outlook.  If we are unable to recover a substantial portion of the increase in material and transportation costs from our customers through price adjustments and/or surcharges, our business or results of operations could be adversely affected. We may also experience an increase in order cancellations if any such pricing actions are not accepted by our customers.       Failure to keep pace with technological developments may adversely affect our operations.We are engaged in an industry that will be affected by future technological developments. The introduction of products or processes utilizing new technologies, including those resulting from any new ESG regulations, could require us and our suppliers to make significant changes to existing products or processes in order for them to remain marketable and competitive. Our success will depend upon our ability to source, develop and introduce on a timely and cost-effective basis new products, applications and processes that keep pace with technological developments, ESG regulations and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. We may not be successful in identifying, sourcing, developing and marketing new products, applications and processes and product or process enhancements. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products, applications or processes. Our products, applications or processes may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected if we or our suppliers were to incur delays in developing new products, applications or processes or product or process enhancements, or if our products do not gain market acceptance.Our efforts to develop new products and services or enhance existing products and services involve substantial research, development and marketing expenses, and the resulting new or enhanced products or services may not generate sufficient revenues to justify the expense.We place a high priority on developing new products and services, as well as enhancing our existing products and services. As a result of these efforts, we may be required to expend substantial research, development and marketing resources, and the time and expense required to develop a new product or service or enhance an existing product or service are difficult to predict. We may not succeed in developing, introducing or marketing new products or services or product or service enhancements. In addition, we cannot be certain that any new or enhanced product or service will generate sufficient revenue to justify the expense and resources devoted to the related product diversification effort.Disruptions within our dealer network or the inability of our dealers to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect our business.We rely on national and global dealer networks to market certain of our products and services. As a result, our business with respect to these products and services is influenced by our ability to manage new and existing relationships with dealers. While we have relatively low turnover of dealers, from time to time, we or a dealer may choose to terminate the relationship as a result of difficulties that our dealers experience in operating their businesses due to economic conditions or other factors. While we do not believe our business is dependent on any single dealer, a disruption in our dealer network, or with a significant dealer, or within a specific market, could have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market. In addition, our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchases of our products. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These sources of financing are vital to our ability to sell products through our dealer network. Recent significant increases in interest rates and any future deterioration in the liquidity or credit worthiness of our dealers could have a significant adverse effect on our business. From time to time, we may provide financing assistance to dealers or consider taking ownership positions. The loss or termination of a significant dealer, or a 9Table of Contentssignificant number of dealers, could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our products and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. We may be unsuccessful in our future acquisitions, if any, which may have an adverse effect on our business.Our long-term strategy includes exploring acquisitions of companies or businesses to facilitate our growth, enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Such acquisitions may help us expand into adjacent markets, add complementary products and services or allow us to leverage our distribution channels. In connection with this strategy, we could face certain risks and uncertainties in addition to those we face in the day-to-day operations of our business. We also may be unable to identify suitable targets for acquisition or to make acquisitions at favorable prices. If we identify a suitable acquisition candidate, our ability to successfully implement the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms. In addition, our acquisition activities could be disrupted by overtures from competitors for the targeted companies, governmental regulation and rapid developments in our industry that decrease the value of a potential target’s products or services.Acquisitions involve risks, including those associated with the following:•integrating the operations, financial reporting, disparate systems and processes and personnel of acquired companies;•managing geographically dispersed operations;•diverting management’s attention from other business concerns;•changing the competitive landscape, including disrupting existing sales channels or markets;•entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience; and•losing key employees, customers and strategic partners of acquired companies.We also may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits associated with our acquisitions. Acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of, among other things, the incurrence of debt, acquisition costs, impairment of goodwill and amortization of other intangible assets. In addition, future acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities.Businesses acquired by us may have liabilities that are not known to us.We may assume liabilities in connection with the acquisition of businesses. There may be liabilities that we fail or are unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the acquired businesses, or that may be more material than we expected. In these circumstances, we cannot assure that our rights to indemnification will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the businesses or property acquired. Further, these liabilities could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.We could incur restructuring and impairment charges as we continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure.We continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure. These actions could result in significant charges that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future actions could result in restructuring and related charges, including but not limited to impairments, employee termination costs and charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits and pension curtailments that could be significant and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.Indebtedness RiskWe are subject to a number of restrictive debt covenants.Our credit facility contains certain restrictive debt covenants and customary events of default. Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants may be affected by the other factors described in this “Risk Factors
” section, as well as other factors outside of our control, including increased indebtedness and/or lower earnings as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Failure to comply with one or more of these restrictive covenants may result in an event of default which, if not cured by us or waived by our lenders, allows our lenders to declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable. Such an acceleration of the maturity of our indebtedness may cause us to incur substantial costs and may prevent or limit us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions and taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. 10Table of ContentsHuman Capital and Labor RisksOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.Our ability to operate our businesses and implement our strategies depends in part on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. In addition, our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. The loss of the services of any key employee or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business or business prospects.Additionally, availability of labor in the markets in which we operate has declined in recent years and competition for such labor has increased, especially under the economic crises experienced through the coronavirus pandemic. A significant increase in wages paid by competitors for employees similar to our work force could result in insufficient availability of workers and/or increase our labor costs. In the event prevailing wage rates continue to increase in the markets in which we operate, we may be required to concurrently increase the wages paid to our employees to maintain the quality of our work force and customer service. If the supply of skilled labor is constrained or our costs of attracting and maintaining a workforce increase and such costs, our profit margins could decrease as well our ability to maximize production and meet customer demand.Our business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters.As a portion of our workforce is unionized, we are subject to risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 10% of our U.S. hourly workers were represented by labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions. Any strikes, threats of strikes or other organized disruptions in connection with the negotiation of new labor agreements or other negotiations could materially adversely affect our business as well as impair our ability to implement further measures to reduce costs and improve production efficiencies. In addition, the stoppage of work for a prolonged period of time at one, or several, of our principal manufacturing facilities, due to public health concerns, or any other reason, could materially adversely affect our business.Our pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside of our control, including the performance of plan assets, the discount rate used to value liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory changes.Our funding obligations and pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans are driven by the performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value the plans’ liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory funding requirements. Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. In addition, a portion of our pension plan assets are invested in equity securities, which can experience significant declines if financial markets weaken. The level of the funding of our defined benefit pension plan liabilities was approximately 86% as of December 31, 2022. Funding of the Company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Our future pension expenses and funding requirements could increase significantly due to the effect of adverse changes in the discount rate, asset values or the estimated expected return on plan assets. In addition, we could become legally required to make increased cash contributions to the pension plans, and these contributions could be material and negatively affect our cash flow.Data Security and Intellectual Property RisksIncreased information technology security threats and more sophisticated cybersecurity attacks pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and operations.We rely upon information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, to support a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive information relating to our businesses, customers, suppliers and employees. Sensitive information may also be stored by our vendors and on the platforms and networks of third-party providers. The secure operation of these information technology systems and networks and processing and maintenance of this information is critical to the Company’s business operations and strategy. These information technology systems and networks may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to hardware failures, computer viruses, cybersecurity attacks, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophic events or other factors. Further, information technology security threats are growing in frequency and sophistication. Accordingly, we have implemented and continue to implement measures to address cybersecurity attacks and mitigate potential risks to our systems from these information technology-related disruptions. Despite the information security measures we have taken, our systems and networks remain potentially vulnerable to attacks, as do those of our vendors and third-party providers. Cybersecurity attacks on the Company, our vendors or our third-party providers could potentially result in the compromising of confidential information, misuse of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, misappropriation of assets or 11Table of Contentsproduction stoppages and supply shortages, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. Although we have not suffered any significant cyber incidents that have had a material business impact, we and our vendors have, from time to time, been the target of malicious cyber threats. While various procedures and controls have been and are being utilized to mitigate information technology risks, there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls that we and our third-party providers have implemented will be sufficient to protect our systems, information or other property. Further, the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity attack.  Infringement of, or an inability to protect, our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems, physical security and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property and the intellectual property of certain customers and suppliers. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts to protect these intellectual property rights will be sufficient. Intellectual property protection is subject to applicable laws in various jurisdictions where interpretations and protections differ or can be unpredictable and costly to enforce. Further, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain foreign jurisdictions that do not have, or do not enforce, strong intellectual property rights. Any failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.Legal and Financial RisksWe may incur material losses and costs as a result of lawsuits or claims that may be brought against us which are related to product liability, warranty, product recalls, intellectual property, client service interruptions or other matters.We are exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the normal course of business in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. For example, we have been sued by firefighters seeking damages claiming that exposure to our sirens has impaired their hearing and that the sirens are, therefore, defective. In addition, we are subject to other claims and litigation from time to time, as further described in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. We could experience material product liability or warranty costs in the future and incur significant costs to defend ourselves against these claims. While we carry insurance and maintain reserves for product liability claims, our insurance coverage may be inadequate if such claims do arise, and any defense costs and liability not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. A future claim could involve the imposition of punitive damages, the award of which, pursuant to state laws, may not be covered by insurance. In addition, warranty and certain other claims are not typically covered by insurance. Any product liability or warranty issues may adversely impact our reputation as a manufacturer of high-quality, safe products and may have a material adverse effect on our business.The costs associated with complying with environmental, safety and other ESG regulations could lower our margins.We, like other manufacturers, continue to face heavy governmental regulation of our products, especially in the areas of the environment and employee health and safety. Increased public awareness and concern regarding climate change and other ESG matters at numerous levels of government in various jurisdictions may lead to additional international, national, regional and local legislative and regulatory responses, and compliance with any new rules could be difficult and costly. These regulations could include environmental requirements applicable to manufacturing and vehicle emissions and regulations impacting our supply chain both nationally and internationally. Complying with environmental, safety and other ESG requirements has added and will continue to add to the cost of our products, could increase the capital required to support our business and could affect the products and services that we offer. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these laws and regulations, we may be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to our operations under existing laws or those that may be adopted. These requirements are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Therefore, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions as a result of violation of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and safety regulations. Further, climate change regulations at the federal, state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to limit emissions, change our manufacturing processes or product offerings, or undertake other activities which may require us to incur additional expense. These requirements may increase the cost of our products, which may diminish demand for those products. Additionally, uneven application of environmental, safety and other ESG regulations could place our products at a cost or features disadvantage, which could reduce our revenues and profitability. A failure, or perceived failure, to respond to investor or customer expectations related to ESG concerns in areas such as climate change and supply chain management could materially adversely affect our business and reputation.12Table of ContentsAn impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.As of December 31, 2022, goodwill and intangible assets represented 30% and 14% of total consolidated assets, respectively. Rental equipment and properties and equipment are long-lived assets, which also collectively represented 19% of our total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2022. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Definite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, competition and market and general economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about our sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors. An impairment charge may result from, among other things, a significant decline in operating results, adverse market conditions, unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations, or a variety of other factors. Our total consolidated assets and results of operations for the applicable period could be materially adversely affected if any such charge is recorded"
17,FSS,FEDERAL SIGNAL CORP,2022-03-01,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
.We may occasionally make forward-looking statements and estimates such as forecasts and projections of our future performance or statements of our plans and objectives. These forward-looking statements may be contained in, but are not limited to, filings with the SEC, including this Form 10-K, press releases made by us and oral statements made by our officers. Actual results could differ materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those contained in such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the risks described below. Many of such risks and uncertainties may be exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment that may result.Macroeconomic and Industry RisksOur financial results are subject to U.S. economic uncertainty.In 2021, we generated approximately 76% of our net sales in the U.S. Our ability to be profitable depends heavily on varying conditions in the U.S. governmental and municipal markets, as well as the overall U.S. economy. The industrial markets in which we compete are subject to considerable cyclicality, and move in response to cycles in the overall business environment. Many of our customers are municipal government agencies, and as a result, we are dependent on municipal government spending. Spending by our municipal customers can be affected by federal, state and local political circumstances, budgetary constraints, changing priorities, actual or potential government shutdowns and other factors. The U.S. government and municipalities depend heavily on tax revenues as a source of spending and accordingly, there is a historical correlation that suggests a lag of one to two years between the condition of the U.S. economy and our sales to the U.S. government and municipalities. Therefore, downturns in the U.S. economy are likely to result in decreases in demand for our products. During previous economic downturns, we experienced decreases in sales and profitability, and we expect our business to remain subject to similar economic fluctuations in the future. In addition, the extent of any potential changes to policies and regulations under the current U.S. administration, and how any such changes may impact the Company’s operations, is currently uncertain.   The extent to which the coronavirus pandemic will continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted but could be material.The coronavirus pandemic has created, and continues to create, significant worldwide volatility, uncertainty and disruption. In particular, the pandemic and the governmental responses to the pandemic have resulted in a substantial curtailment of business activities, a significant number of business closures, slowdowns, suspensions or delays of production and commercial activity, and weakened economic conditions, both in the United States and in many foreign countries. As such, the pandemic has directly and indirectly adversely impacted the Company and such adverse impact will likely continue. However, the extent to which the pandemic will ultimately adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results, which could be material, will depend on numerous evolving factors that are highly uncertain, rapidly changing and cannot be predicted at this time, including:•the duration and scope of the pandemic, including the emergence of new variants;•governmental, business and individual actions that have been, continue to be and may in the future be taken in response to the pandemic, including business and travel restrictions, “stay-at-home” and “shelter-in-place” directives, quarantines, and slowdowns, suspensions or delays of commercial activity;•the dissemination and adoption of coronavirus vaccines and their effectiveness against new variants and any government-mandated vaccine or testing requirement in any of our facilities and markets;•the effect of the pandemic and the government response on our dealers, distributors and other channel partners and customers, including their ability to remain open, continue to sell and service our products, pay for the products purchased from us and obtain vehicle chassis, to the extent that they source such components directly;•the effect of the pandemic and the governmental response on the budgets of our municipal customers;•our ability to continue to run our operations as an essential business during the pandemic and/or to maintain our normal production capacity, in light of the potential for adverse impacts associated with decreased labor availability, including as a result of any government-mandated vaccine or testing requirement or otherwise, the temporary suspension of production activity mandated or otherwise made necessary by governmental authorities, weakened demand, supply chain disruptions, or other production delays;•significant reductions or volatility in demand for one or more of our products or services;•the effect of the pandemic on our suppliers and our ability to obtain commodities, components and parts, on a timely basis through our supply chain and at previously anticipated costs;•logistics costs and challenges, including availability of transportation and at previously anticipated costs;•costs incurred as a result of necessary actions and preparedness plans to help ensure the health and safety of our employees and continued operations, including remote working accommodations, enhanced cleaning processes, 7Table of Contentsprotocols designed to implement appropriate social distancing practices, and/or adoption of additional wage and benefit programs to assist employees;   •costs incurred relating to coronavirus-related medical expenses;•potential future restructuring, impairment and other charges;•availability of employees, their ability to conduct work away from normal working locations and/or under revised work environment protocols, the general willingness of employees to come to and perform work and the impact of any government-mandated vaccine or testing requirement;•the impact of the pandemic on the financial and credit markets and economic activity generally;•our ability to access lending, capital markets, and other sources of liquidity when needed on reasonable terms or at all;•our ability to comply with the financial covenants in our debt agreements if a material economic downturn as a result of the pandemic results in substantially increased indebtedness and/or lower earnings; and•the exacerbation of negative impacts resulting from the occurrence of a global or national recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event as a result of the pandemic.We have international operations that are subject to compliance with domestic and foreign laws and regulations, economic and political uncertainties and conflicts and foreign currency rate fluctuations.Our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and changing international economic, legal and political conditions that are beyond our control. In 2021, approximately 24% of our net sales were to customers outside the U.S. and we expect a significant portion of our revenues to come from international sales in the foreseeable future. Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks, including the need to comply with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) Bribery Act and their counterparts in other foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, restrictive domestic and international trade regulations, and changes in these laws, regulations and policies by the U.S. and foreign governments. In addition, we may be exposed to risks and adverse economic effects associated with emerging geopolitical conflicts, actual or threatened imposition of tariffs or trade barriers on our products or materials incorporated into our products, actual or threatened trade disputes, including so-called “trade wars,” political and economic instability in the jurisdictions in which we operate, foreign receivables collection risk and local labor market conditions. Further, government administrations and agencies, the investment community, employees and other stakeholders have had an increased focus on certain climate change and other environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors, issues and initiatives. Regulatory and other legal changes in laws in response to such ESG matters could require material efforts and costs by us to comply with such changes. The costs of compliance with the various laws, regulations and policies applicable to us could be significant and penalties for non-compliance could significantly impact our business.To the extent that our international operations are affected by adverse foreign economic or political conditions, we may experience disruptions and losses that could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. To mitigate the risk of foreign receivables collection, we may obtain letters of credit from international customers to satisfy concerns regarding the collectability of amounts billed to customers. Some of our contracts are denominated in foreign currencies, which may expose us to risks of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange. Changes in the value of foreign currencies over the long term could increase our U.S. dollar costs for, or reduce our U.S. dollar revenues from, our foreign operations. Any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.The execution of our growth strategy is dependent upon the continued availability of credit and third-party financing arrangements for our customers.Economic downturns result in tighter credit markets, which could adversely affect our customers’ ability to secure financing or to secure financing at favorable terms or interest rates necessary to proceed or continue with purchases of our products and services. Further, certain government agencies, including the U.S. Treasury, have implemented or signaled the implementation of policies that may result in increased interest rates and borrowing costs. Our customers’ or potential customers’ inability to secure financing for projects could result in the delay, cancellation or downsizing of new purchases or the suspension of purchases already under contract, which could cause a decline in the demand for our products and services and negatively impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.We operate in highly competitive markets.The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do. The intensity of this competition, which is expected to continue, can result in price discounting and margin pressures throughout the industry and may adversely affect our ability to increase or maintain prices for our products. In addition, certain of our competitors may have lower overall labor or material costs. In some cases, our contracts with municipal 8Table of Contentsand other governmental customers are awarded and renewed through competitive bidding. We may not be successful in obtaining or renewing these contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.Strategic and Operational RisksFailure to keep pace with technological developments may adversely affect our operations.We are engaged in an industry that will be affected by future technological developments. The introduction of products or processes utilizing new technologies, including those resulting from any new ESG regulations, could require us to make significant changes to our existing products or processes in order for them to remain marketable and competitive. Our success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce on a timely and cost-effective basis new products, applications and processes that keep pace with technological developments and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. We may not be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products, applications and processes and product or process enhancements. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products, applications or processes. Our products, applications or processes may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected if we were to incur delays in developing new products, applications or processes or product or process enhancements, or if our products do not gain market acceptance.Our efforts to develop new products and services or enhance existing products and services involve substantial research, development and marketing expenses, and the resulting new or enhanced products or services may not generate sufficient revenues to justify the expense.We place a high priority on developing new products and services, as well as enhancing our existing products and services. As a result of these efforts, we may be required to expend substantial research, development and marketing resources, and the time and expense required to develop a new product or service or enhance an existing product or service are difficult to predict. We may not succeed in developing, introducing or marketing new products or services or product or service enhancements. In addition, we cannot be certain that any new or enhanced product or service will generate sufficient revenue to justify the expense and resources devoted to the related product diversification effort.The inability to obtain raw materials, component parts and/or finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products.We purchase from suppliers raw materials, component parts and finished goods to be used in the manufacturing and sale of our products. In addition, we may incorporate vehicle chassis provided directly by our customers in our production process. Although the vast majority of our raw materials and component parts are sourced domestically, certain of our suppliers are based overseas, and certain of our domestic suppliers may source subcomponents from overseas. Outbreaks of communicable diseases have been known to occur in certain of these international regions, resulting in public health crises. Global markets for various products and goods have suffered, and are continuing to suffer, material disruptions to certain supply chains. Changes in our relationships with suppliers, shortages in availability of materials, production delays, regulatory restrictions, public health crises, or other supply chain disruptions, whether due to our suppliers or customers, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely manufacture and deliver products to our customers. Increases in the costs of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions, delays, inefficiencies or our inability to market products. In addition, our profit margins would decrease if prices of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods increase and we are unable to pass on those increases to our customers. As economies around the world have recovered since the initial onset of the pandemic, sharp increases in demand have created significant disruption to the global supply chain, which has adversely affected our ability to receive goods on a timely basis and increased our material costs. Short-term or sustained increases in market demand may exceed our suppliers’ production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain. Our failure, or our suppliers’ failure, to meet the demand for raw materials and components could adversely affect our business and results of operations. During 2021, our manufacturing operations were adversely affected as the continuity of our material supply was adversely impacted by capacity constraints, global logistics disruptions, component shortages and coronavirus-related production downtime at certain suppliers. We are currently experiencing supply shortages and inflationary pressure for certain components and raw materials, including chassis, hydraulic pumps, steel, aluminum and electronic components that are important to our manufacturing processes. When facing supply-related challenges, we may increase our inventory levels and purchase commitments to shorten lead times and to help maintain adequate inventory levels to meet customer expectations. While we actively monitor and take steps in an effort to mitigate supply chain risk, there can be no assurance that our mitigation plans will prevent disruptions that may arise from shortages of materials that we use in the production of our products. 9Table of ContentsChallenges within global logistics networks, including shortages of shipping containers, international port congestion, trucking and chassis shortages, rail, ocean and air freight capacity constraints, and shortages in labor availability, have resulted in delays in receiving key manufacturing components, increased order backlogs and higher transportation costs. Such logistical disruption may cause us to incur higher freight costs to expedite the receipt of components from our suppliers or the delivery of products to our customers, and may also result in longer lead times for our customers.Uncertainties related to the magnitude and duration of global supply chain disruptions have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business and our outlook. If we are unable to recover a substantial portion of the increase in material and transportation costs from our customers through price adjustments and/or surcharges, our business or results of operations could be adversely affected. We may also experience an increase in order cancellations if any such pricing actions are not accepted by our customers.  Disruptions within our dealer network or the inability of our dealers to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect our business.We rely on national and global dealer networks to market certain of our products and services. As a result, our business with respect to these products and services is influenced by our ability to manage new and existing relationships with dealers. While we have relatively low turnover of dealers, from time to time, we or a dealer may choose to terminate the relationship as a result of difficulties that our dealers experience in operating their businesses due to economic conditions or other factors. While we do not believe our business is dependent on any single dealer, a disruption in our dealer network, or with a significant dealer, or within a specific market, could have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market. In addition, our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchases of our products. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These sources of financing are vital to our ability to sell products through our dealer network. Deterioration in the liquidity or credit worthiness of our dealers could have a significant adverse effect on our business. From time to time, we may provide financing assistance to dealers or consider taking ownership positions. The loss or termination of a significant dealer, or a significant number of dealers, could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our products and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. We may be unsuccessful in our future acquisitions, if any, which may have an adverse effect on our business.Our long-term strategy includes exploring acquisitions of companies or businesses to facilitate our growth, enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Such acquisitions may help us expand into adjacent markets, add complementary products and services or allow us to leverage our distribution channels. In connection with this strategy, we could face certain risks and uncertainties in addition to those we face in the day-to-day operations of our business. We also may be unable to identify suitable targets for acquisition or to make acquisitions at favorable prices. If we identify a suitable acquisition candidate, our ability to successfully implement the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms. In addition, our acquisition activities could be disrupted by overtures from competitors for the targeted companies, governmental regulation and rapid developments in our industry that decrease the value of a potential target’s products or services.Acquisitions involve risks, including those associated with the following:•integrating the operations, financial reporting, disparate systems and processes and personnel of acquired companies;•managing geographically dispersed operations;•diverting management’s attention from other business concerns;•changing the competitive landscape, including disrupting existing sales channels or markets;•entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience; and•losing key employees, customers and strategic partners of acquired companies.We also may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits associated with our acquisitions. Acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of, among other things, the incurrence of debt, acquisition costs, impairment of goodwill and amortization of other intangible assets. In addition, future acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities.10Table of ContentsBusinesses acquired by us may have liabilities that are not known to us.We may assume liabilities in connection with the acquisition of businesses. There may be liabilities that we fail or are unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the acquired businesses, or that may be more material than we discovered. In these circumstances, we cannot assure that our rights to indemnification will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the businesses or property acquired. Further, these liabilities could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.We could incur restructuring and impairment charges as we continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure.We continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure. These actions could result in significant charges that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future actions could result in restructuring and related charges, including but not limited to impairments, employee termination costs and charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits and pension curtailments that could be significant and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.Indebtedness RiskWe are subject to a number of restrictive debt covenants.Our credit facility contains certain restrictive debt covenants and customary events of default. Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants may be affected by the other factors described in this “Risk Factors
” section, as well as other factors outside of our control. Failure to comply with one or more of these restrictive covenants may result in an event of default which, if not cured by us or waived by our lenders, allows our lenders to declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable. Such an acceleration of the maturity of our indebtedness may cause us to incur substantial costs and may prevent or limit us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions and taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. Human Capital and Labor RisksOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.Our ability to operate our businesses and implement our strategies depends in part on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. In addition, our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. The loss of the services of any key employee or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business or business prospects.Our business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters.As a portion of our workforce is unionized, we are subject to risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 13% of our U.S. hourly workers were represented by labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions. Our current collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers is due to expire in April 2022. Any strikes, threats of strikes or other organized disruptions in connection with the negotiation of new labor agreements or other negotiations could materially adversely affect our business as well as impair our ability to implement further measures to reduce costs and improve production efficiencies. In addition, the stoppage of work for a prolonged period of time at one, or several, of our principal manufacturing facilities, due to public health concerns or the implementation of any government-mandated vaccine or testing requirement, or any other reason, could materially adversely affect our business.Our pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside of our control, including the performance of plan assets, the discount rate used to value liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory changes.Our funding obligations and pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans are driven by the performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value the plans’ liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory funding requirements. Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. In addition, a portion of our pension plan assets are invested in equity securities, which can experience significant declines if financial markets weaken. The level of the funding of our defined benefit pension plan 11Table of Contentsliabilities was approximately 91% as of December 31, 2021. Funding of the Company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The current year funding status was impacted by a higher discount rate than in the prior year. Our future pension expenses and funding requirements could increase significantly due to the effect of adverse changes in the discount rate, asset values or the estimated expected return on plan assets. In addition, we could become legally required to make increased cash contributions to the pension plans, and these contributions could be material and negatively affect our cash flow.Data Security and Intellectual Property RisksIncreased information technology security threats and more sophisticated cybersecurity attacks pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and operations.We rely upon information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, to support a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive information relating to our businesses, customers, suppliers and employees. Sensitive information may also be stored by our vendors and on the platforms and networks of third-party providers. The secure operation of these information technology systems and networks and processing and maintenance of this information is critical to the Company’s business operations and strategy. These information technology systems and networks may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to hardware failures, computer viruses, cybersecurity attacks, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophic events or other factors. Further, information technology security threats are growing in frequency and sophistication. Accordingly, we have implemented and continue to implement measures to address cybersecurity attacks and mitigate potential risks to our systems from these information technology-related disruptions. Despite the information security measures we have taken, our systems and networks remain potentially vulnerable to attacks, as do those of our vendors and third-party providers. Cybersecurity attacks on the Company, our vendors or our third-party providers could potentially result in the compromising of confidential information, misuse of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, misappropriation of assets or production stoppages and supply shortages, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. Although we have not suffered any significant cyber incidents that have had a material business impact, we and our vendors have, from time to time, been the target of malicious cyber threats. While various procedures and controls have been and are being utilized to mitigate information technology risks, there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls that we and our third-party providers have implemented will be sufficient to protect our systems, information or other property. Further, the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity attack.  Infringement of, or an inability to protect, our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems, physical security and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property and the intellectual property of certain customers and suppliers. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts to protect these intellectual property rights will be sufficient. Intellectual property protection is subject to applicable laws in various jurisdictions where interpretations and protections differ or can be unpredictable and costly to enforce. Further, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain foreign jurisdictions that do not have, or do not enforce, strong intellectual property rights. Any failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.Legal and Financial RisksWe may incur material losses and costs as a result of lawsuits or claims that may be brought against us which are related to product liability, warranty, product recalls, intellectual property, client service interruptions or other matters.We are exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the normal course of business in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. For example, we have been sued by firefighters seeking damages claiming that exposure to our sirens has impaired their hearing and that the sirens are, therefore, defective. In addition, we are subject to other claims and litigation from time to time, as further described in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. We could experience material product liability or warranty costs in the future and incur significant costs to defend ourselves against these claims. While we carry insurance and maintain reserves for product liability claims, our insurance coverage may be inadequate if such claims do arise, and any defense costs and liability not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. A future claim could involve the imposition of punitive damages, the award of which, pursuant to state laws, may not be covered by insurance. In addition, warranty and certain other claims are not 12Table of Contentstypically covered by insurance. Any product liability or warranty issues may adversely impact our reputation as a manufacturer of high-quality, safe products and may have a material adverse effect on our business.The costs associated with complying with environmental, safety and other ESG regulations could lower our margins.We, like other manufacturers, continue to face heavy governmental regulation of our products, especially in the areas of the environment and employee health and safety. Increased public awareness and concern regarding climate change and other ESG matters at numerous levels of government in various jurisdictions may lead to additional international, national, regional and local legislative and regulatory responses, and compliance with any new rules could be difficult and costly. These regulations could include environmental requirements applicable to manufacturing and vehicle emissions and regulations impacting our supply chain both nationally and internationally. Complying with environmental, safety and other ESG requirements has added and will continue to add to the cost of our products, could increase the capital required to support our business and could affect the products and services that we offer. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these laws and regulations, we may be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to our operations under existing laws or those that may be adopted. These requirements are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Therefore, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions as a result of violation of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and safety regulations. Further, climate change regulations at the federal, state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to limit emissions, change our manufacturing processes or product offerings, or undertake other activities which may require us to incur additional expense. These requirements may increase the cost of our products, which may diminish demand for those products. Additionally, uneven application of environmental, safety and other ESG regulations could place our products at a cost or features disadvantage, which could reduce our revenues and profitability. A failure, or perceived failure, to respond to investor or customer expectations related to ESG concerns in areas such as climate change and supply chain management could materially adversely affect our business and reputation.An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.As of December 31, 2021, goodwill and intangible assets represented 32% and 15% of total consolidated assets, respectively. Rental equipment and properties and equipment are long-lived assets, which also represented more than 5% of our total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2021. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Definite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, competition and market and general economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about our sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors. An impairment charge may result from, among other things, a significant decline in operating results, adverse market conditions, unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations, or a variety of other factors. Our total consolidated assets and results of operations for the applicable period could be materially adversely affected if any such charge is recorded"
5,FSS,FEDERAL SIGNAL CORP,2021-02-25,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
.We may occasionally make forward-looking statements and estimates such as forecasts and projections of our future performance or statements of our plans and objectives. These forward-looking statements may be contained in, but are not limited to, filings with the SEC, including this Form 10-K, press releases made by us and oral statements made by our officers. Actual results could differ materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those contained in such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the risks described below. Many of such risks and uncertainties may be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment that may result.Macroeconomic and Industry RisksOur financial results are subject to U.S. economic uncertainty.In 2020, we generated approximately 77% of our net sales in the U.S. Our ability to be profitable depends heavily on varying conditions in the U.S. governmental and municipal markets, as well as the overall U.S. economy. The industrial markets in which we compete are subject to considerable cyclicality, and move in response to cycles in the overall business environment. Many of our customers are municipal government agencies, and as a result, we are dependent on municipal government spending. Spending by our municipal customers can be affected by federal, state and local political circumstances, budgetary constraints, changing priorities, actual or potential government shutdowns and other factors. The U.S. government and municipalities depend heavily on tax revenues as a source of spending and accordingly, there is a historical correlation that suggests a lag of one to two years between the condition of the U.S. economy and our sales to the U.S. government and municipalities. Therefore, downturns in the U.S. economy are likely to result in decreases in demand for our products. During previous economic downturns, we experienced decreases in sales and profitability, and we expect our business to remain subject to similar economic fluctuations in the future. In addition, the extent of any potential changes to policies and regulations under the new U.S. administration, and how any such changes may impact the Company’s operations, is currently uncertain.   The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted but could be material.The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant worldwide volatility, uncertainty and disruption. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic and the governmental responses to the pandemic have resulted in a substantial curtailment of business activities, a significant number of business closures, slowdowns, suspensions or delays of production and commercial activity, and weakened economic conditions, both in the United States and many foreign countries. As such, the COVID-19 pandemic has directly and indirectly adversely impacted the Company and such adverse impact will likely continue. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will ultimately adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results, which could be material, will depend on numerous evolving factors that are highly uncertain, rapidly changing and cannot be predicted at this time, including:•the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic;•governmental, business and individual actions that have been, continue to be and may in the future be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including business and travel restrictions, “stay-at-home” and “shelter-in-place” directives, quarantines, and slowdowns, suspensions or delays of commercial activity;•the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and the government response on our dealers, distributors and other channel partners and customers, including their ability to remain open, continue to sell and service our products, pay for the products purchased from us and obtain vehicle chassis, to the extent that they source such components directly;•the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and the governmental response on the budgets of our municipal customers;•our ability to continue to run our operations as an essential business during the COVID-19 pandemic and/or to maintain our normal production capacity, in light of the potential for adverse impacts associated with decreased labor availability, the temporary suspension of production activity mandated or otherwise made necessary by governmental authorities, weakened demand, supply chain disruptions, or other production delays;•significant reductions or volatility in demand for one or more of our products or services;•the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our suppliers and our ability to obtain commodities, components and parts, on a timely basis through our supply chain and at previously anticipated costs;•logistics costs and challenges, including availability of transportation and at previously anticipated costs;•costs incurred as a result of necessary actions and preparedness plans to help ensure the health and safety of our employees and continued operations, including remote working accommodations, enhanced cleaning processes, protocols designed to implement appropriate social distancing practices, and/or adoption of additional wage and benefit programs to assist employees;   •potential future restructuring, impairment and other charges;7Table of Contents•availability of employees, their ability to conduct work away from normal working locations and/or under revised work environment protocols and the general willingness of employees to come to and perform work;•the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial and credit markets and economic activity generally;•our ability to access lending, capital markets, and other sources of liquidity when needed on reasonable terms or at all;•our ability to comply with the financial covenants in our debt agreements if a material economic downturn as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic results in substantially increased indebtedness and/or lower earnings; and•the exacerbation of negative impacts resulting from the occurrence of a global or national recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.We have international operations that are subject to compliance with domestic and foreign laws and regulations, economic and political uncertainties and foreign currency rate fluctuations.Our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and changing international economic, legal and political conditions that are beyond our control. In 2020, approximately 23% of our net sales were to customers outside the U.S. and we expect a significant portion of our revenues to come from international sales in the foreseeable future. Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks, including the need to comply with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) Bribery Act and their counterparts in other foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, restrictive domestic and international trade regulations, and changes in these laws, regulations and policies by the U.S. and foreign governments. In addition, we may be exposed to risks associated with actual or threatened imposition of tariffs or trade barriers on our products or materials incorporated into our products, actual or threatened trade disputes, including so-called “trade wars,” political and economic instability in the jurisdictions in which we operate, foreign receivables collection risk, local labor market conditions, and, in some cases, international hostilities. The costs of compliance with these various laws, regulations and policies can be significant and penalties for non-compliance could significantly impact our business.To the extent that our international operations are affected by adverse foreign economic or political conditions, we may experience disruptions and losses that could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. To mitigate the risk of foreign receivables collection, we may obtain letters of credit from international customers to satisfy concerns regarding the collectability of amounts billed to customers. Some of our contracts are denominated in foreign currencies, which may expose us to risks of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange. Changes in the value of foreign currencies over the long term could increase our U.S. dollar costs for, or reduce our U.S. dollar revenues from, our foreign operations. Any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.The execution of our growth strategy is dependent upon the continued availability of credit and third-party financing arrangements for our customers.Economic downturns result in tighter credit markets, which could adversely affect our customers’ ability to secure financing or to secure financing at favorable terms or interest rates necessary to proceed or continue with purchases of our products and services. Our customers’ or potential customers’ inability to secure financing for projects could result in the delay, cancellation or downsizing of new purchases or the suspension of purchases already under contract, which could cause a decline in the demand for our products and services and negatively impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.We operate in highly competitive markets.The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do. The intensity of this competition, which is expected to continue, can result in price discounting and margin pressures throughout the industry and may adversely affect our ability to increase or maintain prices for our products. In addition, certain of our competitors may have lower overall labor or material costs. In some cases, our contracts with municipal and other governmental customers are awarded and renewed through competitive bidding. We may not be successful in obtaining or renewing these contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.Strategic and Operational RisksFailure to keep pace with technological developments may adversely affect our operations.We are engaged in an industry that will be affected by future technological developments. The introduction of products or processes utilizing new technologies could render our existing products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. Our success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce on a timely and cost-effective basis new products, applications and processes 8Table of Contentsthat keep pace with technological developments and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. We may not be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products, applications and processes and product or process enhancements. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products, applications or processes. Our products, applications or processes may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected if we were to incur delays in developing new products, applications or processes or product or process enhancements, or if our products do not gain market acceptance.Our efforts to develop new products and services or enhance existing products and services involve substantial research, development and marketing expenses, and the resulting new or enhanced products or services may not generate sufficient revenues to justify the expense.We place a high priority on developing new products and services, as well as enhancing our existing products and services. As a result of these efforts, we may be required to expend substantial research, development and marketing resources, and the time and expense required to develop a new product or service or enhance an existing product or service are difficult to predict. We may not succeed in developing, introducing or marketing new products or services or product or service enhancements. In addition, we cannot be certain that any new or enhanced product or service will generate sufficient revenue to justify the expense and resources devoted to the related product diversification effort.Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to renew our leases upon their expiration. We lease from third parties approximately 52% of the square footage of the facilities utilized in our operations, including with respect to certain of our manufacturing plants and our sales, service, warehousing and office locations. If we are unable to renew the existing leases on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to relocate the affected operations. Alternatively, we may decide to relocate operations. Relocation could result in material disruptions to our business (including potential changes to our workforce if the new location does not allow for our existing workforce to service it) and our incurrence of significant capital and other expenses, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.We could incur restructuring and impairment charges as we continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure.We continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure. These actions could result in significant charges that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future actions could result in restructuring and related charges, including but not limited to impairments, employee termination costs and charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits and pension curtailments that could be significant and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.The inability to obtain raw materials, component parts and/or finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products.We purchase from suppliers raw materials, component parts and finished goods to be used in the manufacturing and sale of our products. In addition, we may incorporate vehicle chassis provided directly by our customers in our production process. Although the vast majority of our raw materials and component parts are sourced domestically, certain of our suppliers are based overseas, and certain of our domestic suppliers may source subcomponents from overseas. Outbreaks of communicable diseases have been known to occur in certain of these international regions, resulting in public health crises. Changes in our relationships with suppliers, shortages in availability of materials, production delays, regulatory restrictions, public health crises, or other supply chain disruptions, whether due to our suppliers or customers, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely manufacture and market products. Increases in the costs of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions, delays, inefficiencies or our inability to market products. In addition, our profit margins would decrease if prices of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods increase and we are unable to pass on those increases to our customers.Disruptions within our dealer network or the inability of our dealers to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect our business.We rely on national and global dealer networks to market certain of our products and services. As a result, our business with respect to these products and services is influenced by our ability to manage new and existing relationships with dealers. While we have relatively low turnover of dealers, from time to time, we or a dealer may choose to terminate the relationship as a result of difficulties that our dealers experience in operating their businesses due to economic conditions or other factors. While we do not believe our business is dependent on any single dealer, a disruption in our dealer network, or with a significant dealer, or 9Table of Contentswithin a specific market, could have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market. In addition, our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchases of our products. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These sources of financing are vital to our ability to sell products through our dealer network. Deterioration in the liquidity or credit worthiness of our dealers could have a significant adverse effect on our business. From time to time, we may provide financing assistance to dealers or consider taking ownership positions. The loss or termination of a significant dealer, or a significant number of dealers, could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our products and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. We may be unsuccessful in our future acquisitions, if any, which may have an adverse effect on our business.Our long-term strategy includes exploring acquisitions of companies or businesses to facilitate our growth, enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Such acquisitions may help us expand into adjacent markets, add complementary products and services or allow us to leverage our distribution channels. In connection with this strategy, we could face certain risks and uncertainties in addition to those we face in the day-to-day operations of our business. We also may be unable to identify suitable targets for acquisition or to make acquisitions at favorable prices. If we identify a suitable acquisition candidate, our ability to successfully implement the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms. In addition, our acquisition activities could be disrupted by overtures from competitors for the targeted companies, governmental regulation and rapid developments in our industry that decrease the value of a potential target’s products or services.Acquisitions involve risks, including those associated with the following:•integrating the operations, financial reporting, disparate systems and processes and personnel of acquired companies;•managing geographically dispersed operations;•diverting management’s attention from other business concerns;•changing the competitive landscape, including disrupting existing sales channels or markets;•entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience; and•losing key employees, customers and strategic partners of acquired companies.We also may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits associated with our acquisitions. Acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of, among other things, the incurrence of debt, acquisition costs, impairment of goodwill and amortization of other intangible assets. In addition, future acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities.Businesses acquired by us may have liabilities that are not known to us.We may assume liabilities in connection with the acquisition of businesses. There may be liabilities that we fail or are unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the acquired businesses, or that may be more material than we discovered. In these circumstances, we cannot assure that our rights to indemnification will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the businesses or property acquired. Further, these liabilities could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.Indebtedness RiskWe are subject to a number of restrictive debt covenants.Our credit facility contains certain restrictive debt covenants and customary events of default. Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants may be affected by the other factors described in this “Risk Factors
” section, as well as other factors outside of our control. Failure to comply with one or more of these restrictive covenants may result in an event of default which, if not cured by us or waived by our lenders, allows our lenders to declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable. Such an acceleration of the maturity of our indebtedness may cause us to incur substantial costs and may prevent or limit us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions and taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. 10Table of ContentsHuman Capital and Labor RisksOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.Our ability to operate our businesses and implement our strategies depends in part on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. In addition, our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. The loss of the services of any key employee or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business or business prospects.Our business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters.As a portion of our workforce is unionized, we are subject to risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 16% of our U.S. hourly workers were represented by labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions. Any strikes, threats of strikes or other organized disruptions in connection with the negotiation of new labor agreements or other negotiations could materially adversely affect our business as well as impair our ability to implement further measures to reduce costs and improve production efficiencies. In addition, the stoppage of work for a prolonged period of time at one, or several, of our principal manufacturing facilities, due to public health concerns, or any other reason, could materially adversely affect our business.Our pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside of our control, including the performance of plan assets, the discount rate used to value liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory changes.Our funding obligations and pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans are driven by the performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value the plans’ liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory funding requirements. Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. In addition, a portion of our pension plan assets are invested in equity securities, which can experience significant declines if financial markets weaken. The level of the funding of our defined benefit pension plan liabilities was approximately 84% as of December 31, 2020. Funding of the Company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The current year funding status was impacted by a lower discount rate than in the prior year. Our future pension expenses and funding requirements could increase significantly due to the effect of adverse changes in the discount rate, asset values or the estimated expected return on plan assets. In addition, we could become legally required to make increased cash contributions to the pension plans, and these contributions could be material and negatively affect our cash flow.Data Security and Intellectual Property RisksIncreased information technology security threats and more sophisticated cyber-attacks pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and operations.We have observed a global increase in information technology security threats and more sophisticated cyber-attacks. Our business could be impacted by such disruptions, which in turn could pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, accessibility and integrity of information stored and transmitted on those systems and networks. We have adopted measures to address cyber-attacks and mitigate potential risks to our systems from these information technology-related disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, our systems and networks remain potentially vulnerable to attacks. Depending on their nature and scope, such attacks could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information, misuse of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, misappropriation of assets or production stoppages and supply shortages, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.Infringement of, or an inability to protect, our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems, physical security and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property and the intellectual property of certain customers and suppliers. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts to protect these intellectual property rights will be sufficient. Intellectual property protection is subject to applicable laws in various jurisdictions where interpretations and protections differ or can be unpredictable and costly to enforce. Further, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain foreign jurisdictions that do not have, or do not enforce, strong intellectual property rights. Any failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.11Table of ContentsLegal and Financial RisksWe may incur material losses and costs as a result of lawsuits or claims that may be brought against us which are related to product liability, warranty, product recalls, intellectual property, client service interruptions or other matters.We are exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the normal course of business in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. For example, we have been sued by firefighters seeking damages claiming that exposure to our sirens has impaired their hearing and that the sirens are, therefore, defective. In addition, we are subject to other claims and litigation from time to time, as further described in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. We could experience material product liability or warranty costs in the future and incur significant costs to defend ourselves against these claims. While we carry insurance and maintain reserves for product liability claims, our insurance coverage may be inadequate if such claims do arise, and any defense costs and liability not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. A future claim could involve the imposition of punitive damages, the award of which, pursuant to state laws, may not be covered by insurance. In addition, warranty and certain other claims are not typically covered by insurance. Any product liability or warranty issues may adversely impact our reputation as a manufacturer of high-quality, safe products and may have a material adverse effect on our business.The costs associated with complying with environmental and safety regulations could lower our margins.We, like other manufacturers, continue to face heavy governmental regulation of our products, especially in the areas of the environment and employee health and safety. Complying with environmental and safety requirements has added and will continue to add to the cost of our products, and could increase the capital required to support our business. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these laws and regulations, we may be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to our operations under existing laws or those that may be adopted. These requirements are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Therefore, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions as a result of violation of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and safety regulations. Further, climate change regulations at the federal, state or local level or in international jurisdictions could require us to limit emissions, change our manufacturing processes or product offerings, or undertake other activities which may require us to incur additional expense. These requirements may increase the cost of our products, which may diminish demand for those products. In addition, uneven application of environmental or safety regulations could place our products at a cost or features disadvantage, which could reduce our revenues and profitability.An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.As of December 31, 2020, goodwill and intangible assets represented 33% and 13% of total consolidated assets, respectively. Rental equipment and properties and equipment are long-lived assets, which also represented more than 5% of our total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2020. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Definite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, competition and market and general economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about our sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors. An impairment charge may result from, among other things, a significant decline in operating results, adverse market conditions, unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations, or a variety of other factors. Our total consolidated assets and results of operations for the applicable period could be materially adversely affected if any such charge is recorded"
1,FSS,FEDERAL SIGNAL CORP,2020-02-27,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
.We may occasionally make forward-looking statements and estimates such as forecasts and projections of our future performance or statements of our plans and objectives. These forward-looking statements may be contained in, but are not limited to, filings with the SEC, including this Form 10-K, press releases made by us and oral statements made by our officers. Actual results could differ materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those contained in such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the risks described below.Our financial results are subject to U.S. economic uncertainty.In 2019, we generated approximately 78% of our net sales in the U.S. Our ability to be profitable depends heavily on varying conditions in the U.S. governmental and municipal markets, as well as the overall U.S. economy. The industrial markets in which we compete are subject to considerable cyclicality, and move in response to cycles in the overall business environment. Many of our customers are municipal government agencies, and as a result, we are dependent on municipal government spending. Spending by our municipal customers can be affected by federal, state and local political circumstances, budgetary constraints, changing priorities, actual or potential government shutdowns and other factors. The U.S. government and municipalities depend heavily on tax revenues as a source of spending and accordingly, there is a historical correlation that suggests a lag of one to two years between the condition of the U.S. economy and our sales to the U.S. government and municipalities. Therefore, downturns in the U.S. economy are likely to result in decreases in demand for our products. During previous economic downturns, we experienced decreases in sales and profitability, and we expect our business to remain subject to similar economic fluctuations in the future.We have international operations that are subject to compliance with domestic and foreign laws and regulations, economic and political uncertainties and foreign currency rate fluctuations.Our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and changing international economic, legal and political conditions that are beyond our control. In 2019, approximately 22% of our net sales were to customers outside the U.S. and we expect a significant portion of our revenues to come from international sales in the foreseeable future. Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks, including the need to comply with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) Bribery Act and their counterparts in other foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, restrictive domestic and international trade regulations, and changes in these laws, regulations and policies by the U.S. and foreign governments. In addition, we may be exposed to risks associated with actual or threatened imposition of tariffs or trade barriers on our products or materials incorporated into our products, actual or threatened trade disputes, including so-called “trade wars,” political and economic instability in the jurisdictions in which we operate, foreign receivables collection risk, local labor market conditions, and, in some cases, international hostilities. The costs of compliance with these various laws, regulations and policies can be significant and penalties for non-compliance could significantly impact our business. To the extent that our international operations are affected by adverse foreign economic or political conditions, we may experience disruptions and losses that could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. To mitigate the risk of foreign receivables collection, we may obtain letters of credit from international customers to satisfy concerns regarding the collectability of amounts billed to customers. Some of our contracts are denominated in foreign currencies, which may expose us to risks of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange. Changes in the value of foreign currencies over the long term could increase our U.S. dollar costs for, or reduce our U.S. dollar revenues from, our foreign operations. Any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.We are subject to a number of restrictive debt covenants.Our credit facility contains certain restrictive debt covenants and customary events of default. Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants may be affected by the other factors described in this “Risk Factors
” section, as well as other factors outside of our control. Failure to comply with one or more of these restrictive covenants may result in an event of default which, if not cured by us or waived by our lenders, allows our lenders to declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable. Such an acceleration of the maturity of our indebtedness may cause us to incur substantial costs and may prevent or limit us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions and taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. 6Table of ContentsThe execution of our growth strategy is dependent upon the continued availability of credit and third-party financing arrangements for our customers.Economic downturns result in tighter credit markets, which could adversely affect our customers’ ability to secure financing or to secure financing at favorable terms or interest rates necessary to proceed or continue with purchases of our products and services. Our customers’ or potential customers’ inability to secure financing for projects could result in the delay, cancellation or downsizing of new purchases or the suspension of purchases already under contract, which could cause a decline in the demand for our products and services and negatively impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.Our efforts to develop new products and services or enhance existing products and services involve substantial research, development and marketing expenses, and the resulting new or enhanced products or services may not generate sufficient revenues to justify the expense.We place a high priority on developing new products and services, as well as enhancing our existing products and services. As a result of these efforts, we may be required to expend substantial research, development and marketing resources, and the time and expense required to develop a new product or service or enhance an existing product or service are difficult to predict. We may not succeed in developing, introducing or marketing new products or services or product or service enhancements. In addition, we cannot be certain that any new or enhanced product or service will generate sufficient revenue to justify the expense and resources devoted to the related product diversification effort.Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to renew our leases upon their expiration. We lease from third parties approximately 58% of the square footage of the facilities utilized in our operations, including with respect to certain of our manufacturing plants and our sales, service, warehousing and office locations. If we are unable to renew the existing leases on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to relocate the affected operations. Alternatively, we may decide to relocate operations. Relocation could result in material disruptions to our business (including potential changes to our workforce if the new location does not allow for our existing workforce to service it) and our incurrence of significant capital and other expenses, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.We could incur restructuring and impairment charges as we continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure.We continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure. These actions could result in significant charges that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future actions could result in restructuring and related charges, including but not limited to impairments, employee termination costs and charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits and pension curtailments that could be significant and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.We operate in highly competitive markets.The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do. The intensity of this competition, which is expected to continue, can result in price discounting and margin pressures throughout the industry and may adversely affect our ability to increase or maintain prices for our products. In addition, certain of our competitors may have lower overall labor or material costs. In some cases, our contracts with municipal and other governmental customers are awarded and renewed through competitive bidding. We may not be successful in obtaining or renewing these contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.We may incur material losses and costs as a result of lawsuits or claims that may be brought against us which are related to product liability, warranty, product recalls, intellectual property, client service interruptions or other matters.We are exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the normal course of business in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. For example, we have been sued by firefighters seeking damages claiming that exposure to our sirens has impaired their hearing and that the sirens are, therefore, defective. In addition, we are subject to other claims and litigation from time to time, as further described in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. We could experience material product liability or warranty costs in the future and incur significant costs to defend ourselves against these claims. While we carry insurance and maintain reserves for product liability claims, our insurance coverage may be inadequate if such claims do arise, and any defense costs and liability not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. A future claim could involve the imposition of punitive damages, the 7Table of Contentsaward of which, pursuant to state laws, may not be covered by insurance. In addition, warranty and certain other claims are not typically covered by insurance. Any product liability or warranty issues may adversely impact our reputation as a manufacturer of high-quality, safe products and may have a material adverse effect on our business.Failure to keep pace with technological developments may adversely affect our operations.We are engaged in an industry that will be affected by future technological developments. The introduction of products or processes utilizing new technologies could render our existing products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. Our success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce on a timely and cost-effective basis new products, applications and processes that keep pace with technological developments and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. We may not be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products, applications and processes and product or process enhancements. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products, applications or processes. Our products, applications or processes may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected if we were to incur delays in developing new products, applications or processes or product or process enhancements, or if our products do not gain market acceptance.Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated cyber-attacks pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and operations.We have observed a global increase in information technology security threats and more sophisticated cyber-attacks. Our business could be impacted by such disruptions, which in turn could pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, accessibility and integrity of information stored and transmitted on those systems and networks. We have adopted measures to address cyber-attacks and mitigate potential risks to our systems from these information technology-related disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, our systems and networks remain potentially vulnerable to attacks. Depending on their nature and scope, such attacks could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information, misuse of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, misappropriation of assets or production stoppages and supply shortages, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.Infringement of, or an inability to protect, our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems, physical security and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property and the intellectual property of certain customers and suppliers. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts to protect these intellectual property rights will be sufficient. Intellectual property protection is subject to applicable laws in various jurisdictions where interpretations and protections differ or can be unpredictable and costly to enforce. Further, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain foreign jurisdictions that do not have, or do not enforce, strong intellectual property rights. Any failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.The inability to obtain raw materials, component parts and/or finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products.We purchase from suppliers raw materials, component parts and finished goods to be used in the manufacturing and sale of our products. In addition, we may incorporate vehicle chassis provided directly by our customers in our production process. Although the vast majority of our raw materials and component parts are sourced domestically, certain of our suppliers are based overseas, and certain of our domestic suppliers may source subcomponents from overseas. Outbreaks of communicable diseases have been known to occur in certain of these international regions, resulting in public health crises. Changes in our relationships with suppliers, shortages in availability of materials, production delays, regulatory restrictions, public health crises, or other supply chain disruptions, whether due to our suppliers or customers, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely manufacture and market products. Increases in the costs of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions, delays, inefficiencies or our inability to market products. In addition, our profit margins would decrease if prices of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods increase and we are unable to pass on those increases to our customers.8Table of ContentsOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.Our ability to operate our businesses and implement our strategies depends in part on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. In addition, our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. The loss of the services of any key employee or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business or business prospects.Disruptions within our dealer network or the inability of our dealers to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect our business.We rely on national and global dealer networks to market certain of our products and services. As a result, our business with respect to these products and services is influenced by our ability to manage new and existing relationships with dealers. While we have relatively low turnover of dealers, from time to time, we or a dealer may choose to terminate the relationship as a result of difficulties that our dealers experience in operating their businesses due to economic conditions or other factors. While we do not believe our business is dependent on any single dealer, a disruption in our dealer network, or with a significant dealer, or within a specific market, could have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market. In addition, our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchases of our products. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These sources of financing are vital to our ability to sell products through our dealer network. Deterioration in the liquidity or credit worthiness of our dealers could have a significant adverse effect on our business. From time to time, we may provide financing assistance to dealers or consider taking ownership positions. The loss or termination of a significant dealer, or a significant number of dealers, could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our products and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.  Our business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters.As a portion of our workforce is unionized, we are subject to risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 15% of our U.S. hourly workers were represented by labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions. Any strikes, threats of strikes or other organized disruptions in connection with the negotiation of new labor agreements or other negotiations could materially adversely affect our business as well as impair our ability to implement further measures to reduce costs and improve production efficiencies. In addition, the stoppage of work for a prolonged period of time at one, or several, of our principal manufacturing facilities, due to public health concerns, or any other reason, could materially adversely affect our business.Our pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside of our control, including the performance of plan assets, the discount rate used to value liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory changes.Our funding obligations and pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans are driven by the performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value the plans’ liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory funding requirements. Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. In addition, a portion of our pension plan assets are invested in equity securities, which can experience significant declines if financial markets weaken. The level of the funding of our defined benefit pension plan liabilities was approximately 84% as of December 31, 2019. Funding of the Company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. The current year funding status was impacted by a lower discount rate than in the prior year. Our future pension expenses and funding requirements could increase significantly due to the effect of adverse changes in the discount rate, asset values or the estimated expected return on plan assets. In addition, we could become legally required to make increased cash contributions to the pension plans, and these contributions could be material and negatively affect our cash flow. The costs associated with complying with environmental and safety regulations could lower our margins.We, like other manufacturers, continue to face heavy governmental regulation of our products, especially in the areas of the environment and employee health and safety. Complying with environmental and safety requirements has added and will continue to add to the cost of our products, and could increase the capital required to support our business. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these laws and regulations, we may be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to our operations under existing laws or those that may be adopted. These requirements are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Therefore, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions as a result of violation of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and safety regulations. These requirements may increase the cost of our products, which may diminish demand for those 9Table of Contentsproducts. In addition, uneven application of environmental or safety regulations could place our products at a cost or features disadvantage, which could reduce our revenues and profitability.An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.As of December 31, 2019, goodwill and intangible assets represented 33% and 14% of total consolidated assets, respectively. Rental equipment and properties and equipment are long-lived assets, which also represented more than 5% of our total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2019. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Definite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, competition and market and general economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about our sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors. An impairment charge may result from, among other things, a significant decline in operating results, adverse market conditions, unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations, or a variety of other factors. Our total consolidated assets and results of operations for the applicable period could be materially adversely affected if any such charge is recorded.We may be unsuccessful in our future acquisitions, if any, which may have an adverse effect on our business.Our long-term strategy includes exploring acquisitions of companies or businesses to facilitate our growth, enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Such acquisitions may help us expand into adjacent markets, add complementary products and services or allow us to leverage our distribution channels. In connection with this strategy, we could face certain risks and uncertainties in addition to those we face in the day-to-day operations of our business. We also may be unable to identify suitable targets for acquisition or to make acquisitions at favorable prices. If we identify a suitable acquisition candidate, our ability to successfully implement the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms. In addition, our acquisition activities could be disrupted by overtures from competitors for the targeted companies, governmental regulation and rapid developments in our industry that decrease the value of a potential target’s products or services.Acquisitions involve risks, including those associated with the following:•integrating the operations, financial reporting, disparate systems and processes and personnel of acquired companies;•managing geographically dispersed operations;•diverting management’s attention from other business concerns;•changing the competitive landscape, including disrupting existing sales channels or markets;•entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience; and•losing key employees, customers and strategic partners of acquired companies.We also may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits associated with our acquisitions. Acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of, among other things, the incurrence of debt, acquisition costs, impairment of goodwill and amortization of other intangible assets. In addition, future acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities.Businesses acquired by us may have liabilities that are not known to us.We may assume liabilities in connection with the acquisition of businesses. There may be liabilities that we fail or are unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the acquired businesses, or that may be more material than we discovered. In these circumstances, we cannot assure that our rights to indemnification will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the businesses or property acquired. Further, these liabilities could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow"

.We may occasionally make forward-looking statements and estimates such as forecasts and projections of our future performance or statements of our plans and objectives. These forward-looking statements may be contained in, but are not limited to, filings with the SEC, including this Form 10-K, press releases made by us and oral statements made by our officers. Actual results could differ materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those contained in such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the risks described below.Our financial results are subject to U.S. economic uncertainty.In 2018, we generated approximately 78% of our net sales in the U.S. Our ability to be profitable depends heavily on varying conditions in the U.S. governmental and municipal markets, as well as the overall U.S. economy. The industrial markets in which we compete are subject to considerable cyclicality, and move in response to cycles in the overall business environment. Many of our customers are municipal government agencies, and as a result, we are dependent on municipal government spending. Spending by our municipal customers can be affected by federal, state and local political circumstances, budgetary constraints, changing priorities, actual or potential government shutdowns and other factors. The U.S. government and municipalities depend heavily on tax revenues as a source of spending and accordingly, there is a historical correlation that suggests a lag of one to two years between the condition of the U.S. economy and our sales to the U.S. government and municipalities. Therefore, downturns in the U.S. economy are likely to result in decreases in demand for our products. During previous economic downturns, we experienced decreases in sales and profitability, and we expect our business to remain subject to similar economic fluctuations in the future. In addition, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”) may result in changes in federal, state and local tax revenues which could impact governmental spending and demand for our products.We have international operations that are subject to compliance with domestic and foreign laws and regulations, economic and political uncertainties and foreign currency rate fluctuations.Our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and changing international economic, legal and political conditions that are beyond our control. In 2018, approximately 22% of our net sales were to customers outside the U.S. and we expect a significant portion of our revenues to come from international sales in the foreseeable future. Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks, including the need to comply with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) Bribery Act and their counterparts in other foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, restrictive domestic and international trade regulations, changes in these laws, regulations and policies by the U.S. and foreign governments. In addition, we may be exposed to risks associated with actual or threatened imposition of tariffs or trade barriers on our products or materials incorporated into our products, actual or threatened trade disputes, including so-called “trade wars,” political and economic instability in the jurisdictions in which we operate, foreign receivables collection risk, local labor market conditions, and, in some cases, international hostilities. The costs of compliance with these various laws, regulations and policies can be significant and penalties for non-compliance could significantly impact our business. To the extent that our international operations are affected by adverse foreign economic or political conditions, we may experience disruptions and losses which could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. To mitigate the risk of foreign receivables collection, we may obtain letters of credit from international customers to satisfy concerns regarding the collectability of amounts billed to customers. Some of our contracts are denominated in foreign currencies, which may expose us to risks of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange. Changes in the value of foreign currencies over the long term could increase our U.S. dollar costs for, or reduce our U.S. dollar revenues from, our foreign operations. Any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.We are subject to a number of restrictive debt covenants.Our credit facility contains certain restrictive debt covenants and customary events of default. Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants may be affected by the other factors described in this “Risk Factors
” section, as well as other factors outside of our control. Failure to comply with one or more of these restrictive covenants may result in an event of default which, if not cured by us or waived by our lenders, allows our lenders to declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable. Such an acceleration of the maturity of our indebtedness may cause us to incur substantial costs and may prevent or limit us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions and taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. 6Table of ContentsThe execution of our growth strategy is dependent upon the continued availability of credit and third-party financing arrangements for our customers.Economic downturns result in tighter credit markets, which could adversely affect our customers’ ability to secure financing or to secure financing at favorable terms or interest rates necessary to proceed or continue with purchases of our products and services. Our customers’ or potential customers’ inability to secure financing for projects could result in the delay, cancellation or downsizing of new purchases or the suspension of purchases already under contract, which could cause a decline in the demand for our products and services and negatively impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.Our efforts to develop new products and services or enhance existing products and services involve substantial research, development and marketing expenses, and the resulting new or enhanced products or services may not generate sufficient revenues to justify the expense.We place a high priority on developing new products and services, as well as enhancing our existing products and services. As a result of these efforts, we may be required to expend substantial research, development and marketing resources, and the time and expense required to develop a new product or service or enhance an existing product or service are difficult to predict. We may not succeed in developing, introducing or marketing new products or services or product or service enhancements. In addition, we cannot be certain that any new or enhanced product or service will generate sufficient revenue to justify the expense and resources devoted to the related product diversification effort.We could incur restructuring and impairment charges as we continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure.We continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure. These actions could result in significant charges that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future actions could result in restructuring and related charges, including but not limited to impairments, employee termination costs and charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits and pension curtailments that could be significant and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.We operate in highly competitive markets.The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do. The intensity of this competition, which is expected to continue, can result in price discounting and margin pressures throughout the industry and may adversely affect our ability to increase or maintain prices for our products. In addition, certain of our competitors may have lower overall labor or material costs. In some cases, our contracts with municipal and other governmental customers are awarded and renewed through competitive bidding. We may not be successful in obtaining or renewing these contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.We may incur material losses and costs as a result of lawsuits or claims that may be brought against us which are related to product liability, warranty, product recalls, client service interruptions or other matters.We are exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the normal course of business in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. For example, we have been sued by firefighters seeking damages claiming that exposure to our sirens has impaired their hearing and that the sirens are, therefore, defective. In addition, we are subject to other claims and litigation from time to time as further described in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. We could experience material warranty or product liability costs in the future and incur significant costs to defend ourselves against these claims. While we carry insurance and maintain reserves for product liability claims, our insurance coverage may be inadequate if such claims do arise, and any defense costs and liability not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. A future claim could involve the imposition of punitive damages, the award of which, pursuant to state laws, may not be covered by insurance. In addition, warranty and certain other claims are not typically covered by insurance. Any product liability or warranty issues may adversely impact our reputation as a manufacturer of high quality, safe products and may have a material adverse effect on our business.Failure to keep pace with technological developments may adversely affect our operations.We are engaged in an industry that will be affected by future technological developments. The introduction of products or processes utilizing new technologies could render our existing products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. Our success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce on a timely and cost-effective basis new products, applications and 7Table of Contentsprocesses that keep pace with technological developments and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. We may not be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products, applications and processes and product or process enhancements. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products, applications or processes. Our products, applications or processes may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected if we were to incur delays in developing new products, applications or processes or product or process enhancements, or if our products do not gain market acceptance.Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated cyber-attacks pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and operations.We have observed a global increase in information technology security threats and more sophisticated cyber-attacks. Our business could be impacted by such disruptions, which in turn could pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, accessibility and integrity of information stored and transmitted on those systems and networks. We have adopted measures to address cyber-attacks and mitigate potential risks to our systems from these information technology-related disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, our systems and networks remain potentially vulnerable to attacks. Depending on their nature and scope, such attacks could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information, misuse of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, misappropriation of assets or production stoppages and supply shortages, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.Infringement of, or an inability to protect, our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems, physical security and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property and the intellectual property of certain customers and suppliers. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts to protect these intellectual property rights will be sufficient. Intellectual property protection is subject to applicable laws in various jurisdictions where interpretations and protections differ or can be unpredictable and costly to enforce. Further, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain foreign jurisdictions that do not have, or do not enforce, strong intellectual property rights. Any failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.The inability to obtain raw materials, component parts and/or finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products.We purchase from suppliers raw materials, component parts and finished goods to be used in the manufacturing and sale of our products. In addition, we may incorporate vehicle chassis provided directly by our customers in our production process. Changes in our relationships with suppliers, shortages or production delays, whether due to our suppliers or customers, regulatory restrictions or work stoppages by the employees of our suppliers or the chassis suppliers for our customers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely manufacture and market products. In addition, increases in the costs of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions, delays, inefficiencies or our inability to market products. In addition, our profit margins would decrease if prices of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods increase and we are unable to pass on those increases to our customers.Our ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.Our ability to operate our businesses and implement our strategies depends in part on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. In addition, our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. The loss of the services of any key employee or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business or business prospects.Disruptions within our dealer network or the inability of our dealers to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect our business.We rely on national and global dealer networks to market certain of our products and services. A disruption in our dealer network, or with a significant dealer, or within a specific market, could have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market. In addition, our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchases of our products. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These sources of financing are vital to our ability to sell products through our dealer network. Deterioration in the liquidity or credit worthiness of our dealers could have a significant adverse effect on our business. The loss or termination of a significant dealer, 8Table of Contentsor a significant number of dealers, could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our products and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.Our business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters.As a portion of our workforce is unionized, we are subject to risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 17% of our U.S. hourly workers were represented by labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions. Many of these agreements include provisions that limit our ability to realize cost savings. Our current collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers is due to expire in April 2019. Any strikes, threats of strikes or other organized disruptions in connection with the negotiation of new labor agreements or other negotiations could materially adversely affect our business as well as impair our ability to implement further measures to reduce costs and improve production efficiencies. Our pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside of our control, including the performance of plan assets, the discount rate used to value liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory changes.Our funding obligations and pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans are driven by the performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value the plans’ liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory funding requirements. Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. In addition, a portion of our pension plan assets are invested in equity securities, which can experience significant declines if financial markets weaken. The level of the funding of our defined benefit pension plan liabilities was approximately 79% as of December 31, 2018. Funding of the Company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”). The current year funding status was impacted by a lower discount rate than in the prior year. Our future pension expenses and funding requirements could increase significantly due to the effect of adverse changes in the discount rate, asset values or the estimated expected return on plan assets. In addition, we could become legally required to make increased cash contributions to the pension plans, and these contributions could be material and negatively affect our cash flow. The costs associated with complying with environmental and safety regulations could lower our margins.We, like other manufacturers, continue to face heavy governmental regulation of our products, especially in the areas of the environment and employee health and safety. Complying with environmental and safety requirements has added and will continue to add to the cost of our products, and could increase the capital required to support our business. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these laws and regulations, we may be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to our operations under existing laws or those that may be adopted. These requirements are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Therefore, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions as a result of violation of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and safety regulations. These requirements may increase the cost of our products, which may diminish demand for those products. In addition, uneven application of environmental or safety regulations could place our products at a cost or features disadvantage, which could reduce our revenues and profitability.An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, intangible assets or long-lived assets could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.As of December 31, 2018, goodwill and intangible assets represented 37% and 14% of total consolidated assets, respectively. Rental equipment and properties and equipment are long-lived assets which also represented more than 5% of our total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2018. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Definite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, competition and market and general economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about our sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors. An impairment charge may result from, among other things, a significant decline in operating results, adverse market conditions, unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations, or a variety of other factors. Our total consolidated assets and results of operations for the applicable period could be materially adversely affected if any such charge is recorded.9Table of ContentsWe may be unsuccessful in our future acquisitions, if any, which may have an adverse effect on our business.Our long-term strategy includes exploring acquisitions of companies or businesses to facilitate our growth, enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Such acquisitions may help us expand into adjacent markets, add complementary products and services or allow us to leverage our distribution channels. In connection with this strategy, we could face certain risks and uncertainties in addition to those we face in the day-to-day operations of our business. We also may be unable to identify suitable targets for acquisition or to make acquisitions at favorable prices. If we identify a suitable acquisition candidate, our ability to successfully implement the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms. In addition, our acquisition activities could be disrupted by overtures from competitors for the targeted companies, governmental regulation and rapid developments in our industry that decrease the value of a potential target’s products or services.Acquisitions involve risks, including those associated with the following:•integrating the operations, financial reporting, disparate systems and processes and personnel of acquired companies;•managing geographically dispersed operations;•diverting management’s attention from other business concerns;•changing the competitive landscape, including disrupting existing sales channels or markets;•entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience; and•losing key employees, customers and strategic partners of acquired companies.We also may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits associated with our acquisitions. Acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of, among other things, the incurrence of debt, acquisition costs, impairment of goodwill and amortization of other intangible assets. In addition, future acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities.Businesses acquired by us may have liabilities that are not known to us.We may assume liabilities in connection with the acquisition of businesses. There may be liabilities that we fail or are unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the acquired businesses, or that may be more material than we discovered. In these circumstances, we cannot assure that our rights to indemnification will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the businesses or property acquired. Further, these liabilities could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow"

.We may occasionally make forward-looking statements and estimates such as forecasts and projections of our future performance or statements of our plans and objectives. These forward-looking statements may be contained in, but are not limited to, filings with the SEC, including this Form 10-K, press releases made by us and oral statements made by our officers. Actual results could differ materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those contained in such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the risks described below.Our financial results are subject to U.S. economic uncertainty.In 2017, we generated approximately 75% of our net sales in the U.S. Our ability to be profitable depends heavily on varying conditions in the U.S. governmental and municipal markets, as well as the overall U.S. economy. The industrial markets in which we compete are subject to considerable cyclicality, and move in response to cycles in the overall business environment. Many of our customers are municipal government agencies, and as a result, we are dependent on municipal government spending. Spending by our municipal customers can be affected by federal, state and local political circumstances, budgetary constraints, changing priorities, potential government shutdowns and other factors. The U.S. government and municipalities depend heavily on tax revenues as a source of spending and accordingly, there is a historical correlation that suggests a lag of one to two years between the condition of the U.S. economy and our sales to the U.S. government and municipalities. Therefore, downturns in the U.S. economy are likely to result in decreases in demand for our products. During previous economic downturns, we experienced decreases in sales and profitability, and we expect our business to remain subject to similar economic fluctuations in the future. In addition, the extent of any potential impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”) on the U.S. economy is currently uncertain. Changes in federal, state and local tax revenues which may result from the 2017 Tax Act may have an impact on demand for our products.We have international operations that are subject to compliance with domestic and foreign laws and regulations, economic and political uncertainties and foreign currency rate fluctuations.Our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and changing international economic, legal and political conditions that are beyond our control. In 2017, approximately 25% of our net sales were to customers outside the U.S. and we expect a significant portion of our revenues to come from international sales in the foreseeable future. Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks, including the need to comply with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) Bribery Act and their counterparts in other foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, restrictive domestic and international trade regulations, including the imposition of tariffs and trade barriers on our products, changes in these laws, regulations and policies by the U.S. and foreign governments, political and economic instability in the jurisdictions in which we operate, foreign receivables collection risk, local labor market conditions, and, in some cases, international hostilities. The costs of compliance with these various laws, regulations and policies can be significant and penalties for non-compliance could significantly impact our business. To the extent that our international operations are affected by adverse foreign economic or political conditions, we may experience disruptions and losses which could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. To mitigate the risk of foreign receivables collection, we may obtain letters of credit from international customers to satisfy concerns regarding the collectability of amounts billed to customers. 6Table of ContentsSome of our contracts are denominated in foreign currencies, which may expose us to risks of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange. Changes in the value of foreign currencies over the long term could increase our U.S. dollar costs for, or reduce our U.S. dollar revenues from, our foreign operations. Any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.We are subject to a number of restrictive debt covenants.Our credit facility contains certain restrictive debt covenants and customary events of default. Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants may be affected by the other factors described in this “Risk Factors
” section, as well as other factors outside of our control. Failure to comply with one or more of these restrictive covenants may result in an event of default which, if not cured by us or waived by our lenders, allows our lenders to declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable. Such an acceleration of the maturity of our indebtedness may cause us to incur substantial costs and may prevent or limit us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions and taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. The execution of our growth strategy is dependent upon the continued availability of credit and third-party financing arrangements for our customers.Economic downturns result in tighter credit markets, which could adversely affect our customers’ ability to secure financing or to secure financing at favorable terms or interest rates necessary to proceed or continue with purchases of our products and services. Our customers’ or potential customers’ inability to secure financing for projects could result in the delay, cancellation or downsizing of new purchases or the suspension of purchases already under contract, which could cause a decline in the demand for our products and services and negatively impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.Our efforts to develop new products and services or enhance existing products and services involve substantial research, development and marketing expenses, and the resulting new or enhanced products or services may not generate sufficient revenues to justify the expense.We place a high priority on developing new products and services, as well as enhancing our existing products and services. As a result of these efforts, we may be required to expend substantial research, development and marketing resources, and the time and expense required to develop a new product or service or enhance an existing product or service are difficult to predict. We may not succeed in developing, introducing or marketing new products or services or product or service enhancements. In addition, we cannot be certain that any new or enhanced product or service will generate sufficient revenue to justify the expense and resources devoted to the related product diversification effort.We could incur restructuring and impairment charges as we continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure.We continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure. These actions could result in significant charges that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future actions could result in restructuring and related charges, including but not limited to impairments, employee termination costs and charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits and pension curtailments that could be significant and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.We operate in highly competitive markets.The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do. The intensity of this competition, which is expected to continue, can result in price discounting and margin pressures throughout the industry and may adversely affect our ability to increase or maintain prices for our products. In addition, certain of our competitors may have lower overall labor or material costs. In some cases, our contracts with municipal and other governmental customers are awarded and renewed through competitive bidding. We may not be successful in obtaining or renewing these contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.We may incur material losses and costs as a result of lawsuits or claims that may be brought against us which are related to product liability, warranty, product recalls, client service interruptions or other matters.We are exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the normal course of business in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. For example, we have been sued by firefighters seeking damages claiming that exposure to our sirens has 7Table of Contentsimpaired their hearing and that the sirens are, therefore, defective. In addition, we are subject to other claims and litigation from time to time as further described in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. We could experience material warranty or product liability costs in the future and incur significant costs to defend ourselves against these claims. While we carry insurance and maintain reserves for product liability claims, our insurance coverage may be inadequate if such claims do arise, and any defense costs and liability not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. A future claim could involve the imposition of punitive damages, the award of which, pursuant to state laws, may not be covered by insurance. In addition, warranty and certain other claims are not typically covered by insurance. Any product liability or warranty issues may adversely impact our reputation as a manufacturer of high quality, safe products and may have a material adverse effect on our business.Failure to keep pace with technological developments may adversely affect our operations.We are engaged in an industry that will be affected by future technological developments. The introduction of products or processes utilizing new technologies could render our existing products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. Our success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce on a timely and cost-effective basis new products, applications and processes that keep pace with technological developments and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. We may not be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products, applications and processes and product or process enhancements. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products, applications or processes. Our products, applications or processes may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected if we were to incur delays in developing new products, applications or processes or product or process enhancements, or if our products do not gain market acceptance.Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated cyber-attacks pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and operations.We have observed a global increase in information technology security threats and more sophisticated cyber-attacks. Our business could be impacted by such disruptions, which in turn could pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, accessibility and integrity of information stored and transmitted on those systems and networks. We have adopted measures to address cyber-attacks and mitigate potential risks to our systems from these information technology-related disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, our systems and networks remain potentially vulnerable to attacks. Depending on their nature and scope, such attacks could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information, misuse of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, misappropriation of assets, production stoppages and supply shortages, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.Infringement of, or an inability to protect, our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems, physical security and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property and the intellectual property of certain customers and suppliers. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts to protect these intellectual property rights will be sufficient. Intellectual property protection is subject to applicable laws in various jurisdictions where interpretations and protections differ or can be unpredictable and costly to enforce. Further, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain foreign jurisdictions that do not have, or do not enforce, strong intellectual property rights. Any failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.The inability to obtain raw materials, component parts and/or finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products.We purchase from suppliers raw materials, component parts and finished goods to be used in the manufacturing and sale of our products. In addition, we may incorporate vehicle chassis provided directly by our customers in our production process. Changes in our relationships with suppliers, shortages or production delays, whether due to our suppliers or customers, regulatory restrictions or work stoppages by the employees of our suppliers or the chassis suppliers for our customers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely manufacture and market products. In addition, increases in the costs of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions, delays, inefficiencies or our inability to market products. In addition, our profit margins would decrease if prices of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods increase and we are unable to pass on those increases to our customers.8Table of ContentsOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.Our ability to operate our businesses and implement our strategies depends in part on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. In addition, our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. The loss of the services of any key employee or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business or business prospects.Disruptions within our dealer network or the inability of our dealers to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect our business.We rely on national and global dealer networks to market certain of our products and services. A disruption in our dealer network, or with a significant dealer, or within a specific market, could have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market. In addition, our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchases of our products. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These sources of financing are vital to our ability to sell products through our dealer network. Deterioration in the liquidity or credit worthiness of our dealers could have a significant adverse effect on our business. The loss or termination of a significant dealer, or a significant number of dealers, could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our products and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.Our business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters.As a portion of our workforce is unionized, we are subject to risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 18% of our U.S. hourly workers were represented by labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions. Many of these agreements include provisions that limit our ability to realize cost savings. Any strikes, threats of strikes or other organized disruptions in connection with the negotiation of new labor agreements or other negotiations could materially adversely affect our business as well as impair our ability to implement further measures to reduce costs and improve production efficiencies. Our pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside of our control, including the performance of plan assets, the discount rate used to value liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory changes.Our funding obligations and pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans are driven by the performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value the plans’ liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory funding requirements. Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. In addition, a portion of our pension plan assets are invested in equity securities, which can experience significant declines if financial markets weaken. The level of the funding of our defined benefit pension plan liabilities was approximately 80% as of December 31, 2017. Funding of the Company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”). The current year funding status was impacted by a lower discount rate than in the prior year. Our future pension expenses and funding requirements could increase significantly due to the effect of adverse changes in the discount rate, asset values or the estimated expected return on plan assets. In addition, we could become legally required to make increased cash contributions to the pension plans, and these contributions could be material and negatively affect our cash flow. The costs associated with complying with environmental and safety regulations could lower our margins.We, like other manufacturers, continue to face heavy governmental regulation of our products, especially in the areas of the environment and employee health and safety.

These requirements may increase the cost of our products, which may diminish demand for those products. In addition, uneven application of environmental or safety regulations could place our products at a cost or features disadvantage, which could reduce our revenues and profitability.9Table of ContentsAn impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or intangible assets could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.As of December 31, 2017, goodwill and intangible assets, net, represented 38% and 15% of total consolidated assets, respectively. Goodwill and intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition. We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful lives and are subject to an impairment assessment if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, competition and market and general economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about our sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors. An impairment charge may result from, among other things, a significant decline in operating results, adverse market conditions, unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations, or a variety of other factors. Our total consolidated assets and results of operations for the applicable period could be materially adversely affected if any such charge is recorded.We may be unsuccessful in our future acquisitions, if any, which may have an adverse effect on our business.Our long-term strategy includes exploring acquisitions of companies or businesses to facilitate our growth, enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Such acquisitions may help us expand into adjacent markets, add complementary products and services or allow us to leverage our distribution channels. In connection with this strategy, we could face certain risks and uncertainties in addition to those we face in the day-to-day operations of our business.

These forward-looking statements may be contained in, but are not limited to, filings with the SEC, including this Form 10-K, press releases made by us and oral statements made by our officers. Actual results could differ materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those contained in such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the risks described below.Our financial results are subject to U.S. economic uncertainty.In 2016, we generated approximately 72% of our net sales in the U.S. Our ability to be profitable depends heavily on varying conditions in the U.S. governmental and municipal markets, as well as the overall U.S. economy.

During previous economic downturns, we experienced decreases in sales and profitability, and we expect our business to remain subject to similar economic fluctuations in the future.We have international operations that are subject to compliance with domestic and foreign laws and regulations, economic and political uncertainties and foreign currency rate fluctuations.Our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and changing international economic, legal and political conditions that are beyond our control. In 2016, approximately 28% of our net sales were to customers outside the U.S. and we expect a significant portion of our revenues to come from international sales in the foreseeable future. Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks, including the need to comply with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) Bribery Act and their counterparts in other foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, restrictive domestic and international trade regulations, including the imposition of tariffs and trade barriers on our products, changes in these laws, regulations and policies by the U.S. and foreign governments, political and economic instability in the jurisdictions in which we operate, foreign receivables collection risk, local labor market conditions, and, in some cases, international hostilities. The costs of compliance with these various laws, regulations and policies can be significant and penalties for non-compliance could significantly impact our business. To the extent that our international operations are affected by adverse foreign economic or political conditions, we may experience disruptions and losses which could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. To mitigate the risk of foreign receivables collection, we may obtain letters of credit from international customers to satisfy concerns regarding the collectability of amounts billed to customers. Some of our contracts are denominated in foreign currencies, which may expose us to risks of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange. Changes in the value of foreign currencies over the long term could increase our U.S. dollar costs for, or reduce our U.S. dollar revenues from, our foreign operations. Any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.We are subject to a number of restrictive debt covenants.In January 2016, we entered into a new five-year credit facility. The credit facility contains certain restrictive debt covenants and customary events of default. Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants may be affected by the other factors 6Table of Contentsdescribed in this “Risk Factors
” section, as well as other factors outside of our control. Failure to comply with one or more of these restrictive covenants may result in an event of default which, if not cured by us or waived by our lenders, allows our lenders to declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable. Such an acceleration of the maturity of our indebtedness may cause us to incur substantial costs and may prevent or limit us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions and taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. The execution of our growth strategy is dependent upon the continued availability of credit and third-party financing arrangements for our customers.Economic downturns result in tighter credit markets, which could adversely affect our customers’ ability to secure financing or to secure financing at favorable terms or interest rates necessary to proceed or continue with purchases of our products and services. Our customers’ or potential customers’ inability to secure financing for projects could result in the delay, cancellation or downsizing of new purchases or the suspension of purchases already under contract, which could cause a decline in the demand for our products and services and negatively impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.Our efforts to develop new products and services or enhance existing products and services involve substantial research, development and marketing expenses, and the resulting new or enhanced products or services may not generate sufficient revenues to justify the expense.We place a high priority on developing new products and services, as well as enhancing our existing products and services. As a result of these efforts, we may be required to expend substantial research, development and marketing resources, and the time and expense required to develop a new product or service or enhance an existing product or service are difficult to predict. We may not succeed in developing, introducing or marketing new products or services or product or service enhancements. In addition, we cannot be certain that any new or enhanced product or service will generate sufficient revenue to justify the expense and resources devoted to the related product diversification effort.We could incur restructuring and impairment charges as we continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure.We continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure. These actions could result in significant charges that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future actions could result in restructuring and related charges, including but not limited to impairments, employee termination costs and charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits and pension curtailments that could be significant and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.We operate in highly competitive markets.The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do. The intensity of this competition, which is expected to continue, can result in price discounting and margin pressures throughout the industry and may adversely affect our ability to increase or maintain prices for our products. In addition, certain of our competitors may have lower overall labor or material costs. In some cases, our contracts with municipal and other governmental customers are awarded and renewed through competitive bidding. We may not be successful in obtaining or renewing these contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.We may incur material losses and costs as a result of lawsuits or claims that may be brought against us which are related to product liability, warranty, product recalls, client service interruptions or other matters.We are exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the normal course of business in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. For example, we have been sued by firefighters seeking damages claiming that exposure to our sirens has impaired their hearing and that the sirens are, therefore, defective. In addition, we are subject to other claims and litigation from time to time as further described in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. We could experience material warranty or product liability costs in the future and incur significant costs to defend ourselves against these claims. While we carry insurance and maintain reserves for product liability claims, our insurance coverage may be inadequate if such claims do arise, and any defense costs and liability not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. A future claim could involve the imposition of punitive damages, the award of which, pursuant to state laws, may not be covered by insurance. In addition, warranty and certain other claims are not typically covered by insurance. Any product liability or warranty issues may adversely impact our reputation as a manufacturer of high quality, safe products and may have a material adverse effect on our business.7Table of ContentsFailure to keep pace with technological developments may adversely affect our operations.We are engaged in an industry that will be affected by future technological developments. The introduction of products or processes utilizing new technologies could render our existing products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. Our success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce on a timely and cost-effective basis new products, applications and processes that keep pace with technological developments and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. We may not be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products, applications and processes and product or process enhancements. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products, applications or processes. Our products, applications or processes may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected if we were to incur delays in developing new products, applications or processes or product or process enhancements, or if our products do not gain market acceptance.Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated cyber-attacks pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and operations.We have observed a global increase in information technology security threats and more sophisticated cyber-attacks. Our business could be impacted by such disruptions, which in turn could pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, accessibility and integrity of information stored and transmitted on those systems and networks. We have adopted measures to address cyber-attacks and mitigate potential risks to our systems from these information technology-related disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, our systems and networks remain potentially vulnerable to attacks. Depending on their nature and scope, such attacks could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information, misuse of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, misappropriation of assets, production stoppages and supply shortages, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.Infringement of, or an inability to protect, our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems, physical security and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property and the intellectual property of certain customers and suppliers. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts to protect these intellectual property rights will be sufficient. Intellectual property protection is subject to applicable laws in various jurisdictions where interpretations and protections differ or can be unpredictable and costly to enforce. Further, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain foreign jurisdictions that do not have, or do not enforce, strong intellectual property rights. Any failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.The inability to obtain raw materials, component parts and/or finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner from suppliers would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products.We purchase from suppliers raw materials and component parts to be used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we purchase certain finished goods from suppliers. Changes in our relationships with suppliers, shortages, production delays, regulatory restrictions or work stoppages by the employees of such suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely manufacture and market products. In addition, increases in the costs of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions, delays, inefficiencies or our inability to market products. In addition, our profit margins would decrease if prices of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods increase and we are unable to pass on those increases to our customers.Our ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.Our ability to operate our businesses and implement our strategies depends in part on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. In addition, our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. The loss of the services of any key employee or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business or business prospects.Disruptions within our dealer network or the inability of our dealers to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect our business.We rely on national and global dealer networks to market certain of our products and services. A disruption in our dealer network, or with a significant dealer, or within a specific market, could have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market. In addition, our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchases of our 8Table of Contentsproducts. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These sources of financing are vital to our ability to sell products through our dealer network. Deterioration in the liquidity or credit worthiness of our dealers could have a significant adverse effect on our business. The loss or termination of a significant dealer, or a significant number of dealers, could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our products and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.Our business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters.As a portion of our workforce is unionized, we are subject to risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 23% of our U.S. hourly workers were represented by labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Many of these agreements include provisions that limit our ability to realize cost savings. Our current collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers is due to expire in April 2017. Any strikes, threats of strikes or other organized disruptions in connection with the negotiation of new labor agreements or other negotiations could materially adversely affect our business as well as impair our ability to implement further measures to reduce costs and improve production efficiencies. Our pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside of our control, including the performance of plan assets, the discount rate used to value liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory changes.Our funding obligations and pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans are driven by the performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value the plans’ liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory funding requirements. Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. In addition, a portion of our pension plan assets are invested in equity securities, which can experience significant declines if financial markets weaken. The level of the funding of our defined benefit pension plan liabilities was approximately 77% as of December 31, 2016. Funding of the Company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan is determined in accordance with guidelines set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”). The current year funding status was impacted by a lower discount rate than in the prior year. Our future pension expenses and funding requirements could increase significantly due to the effect of adverse changes in the discount rate, asset values or the estimated expected return on plan assets. In addition, we could become legally required to make increased cash contributions to the pension plans, and these contributions could be material and negatively affect our cash flow. The costs associated with complying with environmental and safety regulations could lower our margins.We, like other manufacturers, continue to face heavy governmental regulation of our products, especially in the areas of the environment and employee health and safety. Complying with environmental and safety requirements has added and will continue to add to the cost of our products, and could increase the capital required to support our business. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these laws and regulations, we may be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to our operations under existing laws or those that may be adopted. These requirements are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Therefore, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions as a result of violation of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and safety regulations. These requirements may increase the cost of our products, which may diminish demand for those products. In addition, uneven application of environmental or safety regulations could place our products at a cost or features disadvantage, which could reduce our revenues and profitability.An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.We have a substantial amount of goodwill, which is recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, competition and market and general economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about our sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill recoverability. Goodwill reviews are prepared using estimates of the fair value of reporting units, which incorporate estimates of the present value of future discounted cash flow. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business or a decline in our market capitalization.If the future operating performance of our reporting units is not consistent with our assumptions, we could be required to record non-cash impairment charges. Impairment charges could substantially affect our total consolidated assets and results of 9Table of Contentsoperations in the periods such charges are recorded. As of December 31, 2016, total consolidated goodwill was approximately 37% of total consolidated assets.We may be unsuccessful in our future acquisitions, if any, which may have an adverse effect on our business.Our long-term strategy includes exploring acquisition of companies or businesses to facilitate our growth, enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Such acquisitions may help us expand into adjacent markets, add complementary products and services or allow us to leverage our distribution channels. In connection with this strategy, we could face certain risks and uncertainties in addition to those we face in the day-to-day operations of our business. We also may be unable to identify suitable targets for acquisition or to make acquisitions at favorable prices. If we identify a suitable acquisition candidate, our ability to successfully implement the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms. In addition, our acquisition activities could be disrupted by overtures from competitors for the targeted companies, governmental regulation and rapid developments in our industry that decrease the value of a potential target’s products or services.Acquisitions involve risks, including those associated with the following:•integrating the operations, financial reporting, disparate systems and processes and personnel of acquired companies;•managing geographically dispersed operations;•diverting management’s attention from other business concerns;•changing the competitive landscape, including disrupting existing sales channels or markets;•entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience; and•losing key employees, customers and strategic partners of acquired companies.We also may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits associated with our acquisitions. Acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of, among other things, the incurrence of debt, acquisition costs, impairment of goodwill and amortization of other intangible assets. In addition, future acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities.Businesses acquired by us may have liabilities that are not known to us.We may assume liabilities in connection with the acquisition of businesses. There may be liabilities that we fail or are unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the acquired businesses, or that may be more material than we discovered. In these circumstances, we cannot assure that our rights to indemnification from the sellers of the acquired businesses to us will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the businesses or property acquired. Further, these liabilities could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure, unexpected increases in taxes or other adverse effects on our business. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow"
3,FSS,FEDERAL SIGNAL CORP,2016-02-29,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
.We may occasionally make forward-looking statements and estimates such as forecasts and projections of our future performance or statements of our plans and objectives. These forward-looking statements may be contained in, but are not limited to, filings with the SEC, including this Form 10-K, press releases made by us and oral statements made by our officers. Actual results could differ materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those contained in such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the risks described below.Our financial results are subject to U.S. economic uncertainty.In 2015, we generated approximately 75% of our net sales in the U.S. Our ability to be profitable depends heavily on varying conditions in the U.S. governmental and municipal markets, as well as the overall U.S. economy. The industrial markets in which we compete are subject to considerable cyclicality, and move in response to cycles in the overall business environment. Many of our customers are municipal government agencies, and as a result, we are dependent on municipal government spending. Spending by our municipal customers can be affected by local political circumstances, budgetary constraints and other factors. The U.S. government and municipalities depend heavily on tax revenues as a source of spending and accordingly, there is a historical correlation that suggests a lag of one or two years between the condition of the U.S. economy and our sales to the U.S. government and municipalities. Therefore, downturns in the U.S. economy are likely to result in decreases in demand for our products. During previous economic downturns, we experienced decreases in sales and profitability, and we expect our business to remain subject to similar economic fluctuations in the future.We have international operations that are subject to compliance with domestic and foreign laws and regulations, economic and political uncertainties and foreign currency rate fluctuations.Our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and changing international economic, legal and political conditions that are beyond our control. In 2015, approximately 25% of our net sales were to customers outside the U.S. and we expect a significant portion of our revenues to come from international sales in the foreseeable future. Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks, including the need to comply with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) Bribery Act and their counterparts in other foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, restrictive domestic and international trade regulations, including the imposition of tariffs and trade barriers on our products, changes in these laws, regulations and policies by the U.S. and foreign governments, political and economic instability in the jurisdictions in which we operate, foreign receivables collection risk, local labor market conditions, and, in some cases, international hostilities. The costs of compliance with these various laws, regulations and policies can be significant and penalties for non-compliance could significantly impact our business. To the extent that our international operations are affected by adverse foreign economic or political conditions, we may experience disruptions and losses which could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. To mitigate the risk of foreign receivables collection, we may obtain letters of credit from international customers to satisfy concerns regarding the collectibility of amounts billed to customers. Some of our contracts are denominated in foreign currencies, which may expose us to risks of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange. Changes in the value of foreign currencies over the long term could increase our U.S. dollar costs for, or reduce our U.S. dollar revenues from, our foreign operations. Any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.We are subject to a number of restrictive debt covenants.In January 2016, we entered into a new five-year credit facility. The credit facility contains certain restrictive debt covenants and customary events of default. Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants may be affected by the other factors described in this “Risk Factors
” section, as well as other factors outside of our control. Failure to comply with one or more of these restrictive covenants may result in an event of default which, if not cured by us or waived by our lenders, allows our lenders to declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable. Such an acceleration of the maturity of our indebtedness may prevent or limit us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions and taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. The execution of our growth strategy is dependent upon the continued availability of credit and third-party financing arrangements for our customers.Economic downturns result in tighter credit markets, which could adversely affect our customers’ ability to secure financing or to secure financing at favorable terms or interest rates necessary to proceed or continue with purchases of our products and 6Table of Contentsservices. Our customers’ or potential customers’ inability to secure financing for projects could result in the delay, cancellation or downsizing of new purchases or the suspension of purchases already under contract, which could cause a decline in the demand for our products and services and negatively impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.Our efforts to develop new products and services or enhance existing products and services involve substantial research, development and marketing expenses, and the resulting new or enhanced products or services may not generate sufficient revenues to justify the expense.We place a high priority on developing new products and services, as well as enhancing our existing products and services. As a result of these efforts, we may be required to expend substantial research, development and marketing resources, and the time and expense required to develop a new product or service or enhance an existing product or service are difficult to predict. We may not succeed in developing, introducing or marketing new products or services or product or service enhancements. In addition, we cannot be certain that any new or enhanced product or service will generate sufficient revenue to justify the expense and resources devoted to this product diversification effort.We could incur restructuring and impairment charges as we continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure.We continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure. These actions could result in significant charges that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future actions could result in restructuring and related charges, including but not limited to impairments, employee termination costs and charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits and pension curtailments that could be significant and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.We operate in highly competitive markets.The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do. The intensity of this competition, which is expected to continue, can result in price discounting and margin pressures throughout the industry and may adversely affect our ability to increase or maintain prices for our products. In addition, certain of our competitors may have lower overall labor or material costs. In some cases, our contracts with municipal and other governmental customers are awarded and renewed through competitive bidding. We may not be successful in obtaining or renewing these contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability, warranty, recall claims, client service interruption or other lawsuits or claims that may be brought against us.We are exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the normal course of business in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. For example, we have been sued by firefighters seeking damages claiming that exposure to our sirens has impaired their hearing and that the sirens are, therefore, defective. In addition, we are subject to other claims and litigation from time to time as further described in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. We could experience material warranty or product liability costs in the future and incur significant costs to defend ourselves against these claims. While we carry insurance and maintain reserves for product liability claims, our insurance coverage may be inadequate if such claims do arise, and any defense costs and liability not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. A future claim could involve the imposition of punitive damages, the award of which, pursuant to state laws, may not be covered by insurance. In addition, warranty and certain other claims are not typically covered by insurance. Any product liability or warranty issues may adversely impact our reputation as a manufacturer of high quality, safe products and may have a material adverse effect on our business.Failure to keep pace with technological developments may adversely affect our operations.We are engaged in an industry that will be affected by future technological developments. The introduction of products or processes utilizing new technologies could render our existing products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. Our success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce on a timely and cost-effective basis new products, applications and processes that keep pace with technological developments and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. We may not be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products, applications and processes and product or process enhancements. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products, applications or processes. Our products, applications or processes may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Our financial 7Table of Contentscondition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected if we were to incur delays in developing new products, applications or processes or product or process enhancements, or if our products do not gain market acceptance.Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated cyber-attacks pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and operations.We have observed a global increase in information technology security threats and more sophisticated cyber-attacks. Our business could be impacted by such disruptions, which in turn could pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, accessibility and integrity of information stored and transmitted on those systems and networks. We have adopted measures to address cyber-attacks and mitigate potential risks to our systems from these information technology-related disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, our systems and networks remain potentially vulnerable to attacks. Depending on their nature and scope, such attacks could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information, misuse of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, production stoppages and supply shortages, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.Infringement of, or an inability to protect, our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems, physical security and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property and the intellectual property of certain customers and suppliers. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts to protect these intellectual property rights will be sufficient. Intellectual property protection is subject to applicable laws in various jurisdictions where interpretations and protections differ or can be unpredictable and costly to enforce. Further, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain foreign jurisdictions that do not have, or do not enforce, strong intellectual property rights. Any failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.The inability to obtain raw materials, component parts and/or finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner from suppliers would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products.We purchase from suppliers raw materials and component parts to be used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we purchase certain finished goods from suppliers. Changes in our relationships with suppliers, shortages, production delays, regulatory restrictions or work stoppages by the employees of such suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely manufacture and market products. In addition, increases in the costs of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions, delays, inefficiencies or our inability to market products. In addition, our profit margins would decrease if prices of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods increase and we are unable to pass on those increases to our customers.Our ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.Our ability to operate our businesses and implement our strategies depends in part on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. In addition, our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including finance personnel, research professionals, technical sales professionals and engineers. The loss of the services of any key employee or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business or business prospects.Disruptions within our dealer network or the inability of our dealers to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect our business.We rely on national and global dealer networks to market certain of our products and services. A disruption in our dealer network, or with a significant dealer, or within a specific market, could have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market. In addition, our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchases of our products.  Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms.  These sources of financing are vital to our ability to sell products through our dealer network. Deterioration in the liquidity or credit worthiness of our dealers could have a significant adverse effect on our business and could, in some limited cases, trigger repurchase obligations under an existing agreement with a third-party finance company that provides financing to certain of our dealers to support the purchase of our products. The loss or termination of a significant dealer, or a significant number of dealers, could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our products and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.8Table of ContentsOur business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters.We are subject to risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters because a portion of our workforce is unionized. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 24% of our U.S. hourly workers were represented by labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Many of these agreements include provisions that limit our ability to realize cost savings. Our current collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers is due to expire in April 2016. Any strikes, threats of strikes or other organized disruptions in connection with the negotiation of new labor agreements or other negotiations could materially adversely affect our business as well as impair our ability to implement further measures to reduce costs and improve production efficiencies. Our pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside of our control, including the performance of plan assets, the discount rate used to value liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory changes.Our funding obligations and pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans are driven by the performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value the plans’ liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory funding requirements. Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. In addition, a portion of our pension plan assets are invested in equity securities, which can experience significant declines if financial markets weaken. The level of the funding of our defined benefit pension plan liabilities was approximately 79% as of December 31, 2015. The current year funding status was impacted by higher discount rates. Our future pension expenses and funding requirements could increase significantly due to the effect of adverse changes in the discount rate, asset values or the estimated expected return on plan assets. In addition, we could be legally required to make increased cash contributions to the pension plans, and these contributions could be material and negatively affect our cash flow.The costs associated with complying with environmental and safety regulations could lower our margins.We, like other manufacturers, continue to face heavy governmental regulation of our products, especially in the areas of the environment and employee health and safety. Complying with environmental and safety requirements has added and will continue to add to the cost of our products, and could increase the capital required to support our business. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these laws and regulations, we may be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to our operations under existing laws or those that may be adopted. These requirements are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Therefore, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions as a result of violation of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and safety regulations. These requirements may increase the cost of our products, which may diminish demand for those products.  In addition, uneven application of environmental or safety regulations could place our products at a cost or features disadvantage, which could reduce our revenues and profitability.Our ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to reduce future tax payments could be negatively impacted if there is a change in our ownership or a failure to generate sufficient taxable income.Presently, the only U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) we have remaining are from previously acquired companies and hence are limited to specific annual amounts as permitted by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Section 382”). If an ownership change, as defined in Section 382, occurs with respect to our capital stock, our ability to use these NOLs could be further limited to more restrictive specific annual amounts. Generally, an ownership change occurs if certain persons or groups increase their aggregate ownership by more than 50% of our total capital stock in a three-year period. If more than a 50% ownership change were to occur, use of our NOLs to reduce payments of federal tax may be deferred to later years within the 20-year carryover period; however, if the carryover period for any loss year expires, the use of the remaining NOLs for the loss year will be prohibited. If we should fail to generate a sufficient level of taxable income prior to the expiration of the applicable NOL carryforward periods, then we will lose the ability to apply the NOLs as offsets to future taxable income. We also have a significant amount of tax credit carryforwards (“tax credits”) which are generally available to offset future U.S. income tax. The usage of these tax credits is subject to similar limitations upon a change in ownership. As of December 31, 2015, our tax credits totaled $13.1 million and had various carryforward periods, with the majority beginning to expire in approximately six years. An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.We have a substantial amount of goodwill, which is recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, competition and market and general economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about our sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in applying 9Table of Contentsthese factors to the assessment of goodwill recoverability. Goodwill reviews are prepared using estimates of the fair value of reporting units, which incorporate estimates of the present value of future discounted cash flow. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business or our market capitalization declines.If the future operating performance of our reporting units is not consistent with our assumptions, we could be required to record non-cash impairment charges. Impairment charges could substantially affect our total consolidated assets and results of operations in the periods such charges are recorded. As of December 31, 2015, total consolidated goodwill was approximately 35% of total consolidated assets.We may be unsuccessful in our future acquisitions, if any, which may have an adverse effect on our business.Our long-term strategy includes exploring acquisition of companies or businesses to facilitate our growth, enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Such acquisitions may help us expand into adjacent markets, add complementary products and services or allow us to leverage our distribution channels. In connection with this strategy, we could face certain risks and uncertainties in addition to those we face in the day-to-day operations of our business. We also may be unable to identify suitable targets for acquisition or to make acquisitions at favorable prices. If we identify a suitable acquisition candidate, our ability to successfully implement the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms. In addition, our acquisition activities could be disrupted by overtures from competitors for the targeted companies, governmental regulation and rapid developments in our industry that decrease the value of a potential target’s products or services.Acquisitions involve risks, including those associated with the following:•integrating the operations, financial reporting, disparate systems and processes and personnel of acquired companies;•managing geographically dispersed operations;•diverting management’s attention from other business concerns;•changing the competitive landscape, including disrupting existing sales channels or markets;•entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience; and•losing key employees, customers and strategic partners of acquired companies.We also may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits associated with our acquisitions. Acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of, among other things, the incurrence of debt, acquisition costs, impairment of goodwill and amortization of other intangible assets. In addition, future acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities.Businesses acquired by us may have liabilities that are not known to us.We may assume liabilities in connection with the acquisition of businesses. There may be liabilities that we fail or are unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the acquired businesses, or that may be more material than we discovered. In these circumstances, we cannot assure that our rights to indemnification from the sellers of the acquired businesses to us will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the businesses or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow"
9,FSS,FEDERAL SIGNAL CORP,2015-03-02,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
.We may occasionally make forward-looking statements and estimates such as forecasts and projections of our future performance or statements of our plans and objectives. These forward-looking statements may be contained in, but are not limited to, filings with the SEC, including this Form 10-K, press releases made by us and oral statements made by our officers. Actual results could differ materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those contained in such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the risks described below.5Table of ContentsOur financial results are subject to U.S. economic uncertainty.In 2014, we generated approximately 65% of our net sales in the U.S. Our ability to be profitable depends heavily on varying conditions in the U.S. governmental and municipal markets, as well as the overall U.S. economy. The industrial markets in which we compete are subject to considerable cyclicality, and move in response to cycles in the overall business environment. Many of our customers are municipal government agencies, and as a result, we are dependent on municipal government spending. Spending by our municipal customers can be affected by local political circumstances, budgetary constraints and other factors. The U.S. government and municipalities depend heavily on tax revenues as a source of spending and accordingly, there is a historical correlation of a one or two-year lag between the condition of the U.S. economy and our sales to the U.S. government and municipalities. Therefore, downturns in the U.S. economy are likely to result in decreases in demand for our products. During previous economic downturns, we experienced decreases in sales and profitability, and we expect our business to remain subject to similar economic fluctuations in the future.We have international operations that are subject to compliance with domestic and foreign laws and regulations, economic and political uncertainties and foreign currency rate fluctuations.Our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and changing international economic, legal and political conditions that are beyond our control. In 2014, approximately 35% of our net sales were generated outside the U.S. and we expect a significant portion of our revenues to come from international sales in the foreseeable future. Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks, including the need to comply with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our foreign operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act and their counterparts in other foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, restrictive domestic and international trade regulations, including the imposition of tariffs and trade barriers on our products, changes in these laws, regulations and policies by the U.S. and foreign governments, political and economic instability in the jurisdictions in which we operate, foreign receivables collection risk, local labor market conditions, and, in some cases, international hostilities. The costs of compliance with these various laws, regulations and policies can be significant and penalties for non-compliance could significantly impact our business. To the extent that our international operations are affected by adverse foreign economic or political conditions, we may experience disruptions and losses which could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. To mitigate the risk of foreign receivables collection, we typically obtain letters of credit from international customers to satisfy concerns regarding the collectibility of amounts billed to customers. Some of our contracts are denominated in foreign currencies, which exposes us to the risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange. Changes in the value of foreign currencies over the long term could increase our U.S. dollar costs for, or reduce our U.S. dollar revenues from, our foreign operations. Any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.We are subject to a number of restrictive debt covenants.In March 2013, we entered into a credit facility with a term ending in March 2018. The proceeds from this credit facility were used to refinance the majority of our then-existing indebtedness. The credit facility contains certain restrictive debt covenants and other customary events of default. Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants may be affected by the other factors described in this “Risk Factors
” section and other factors outside of our control. Failure to comply with one or more of these restrictive covenants may result in an event of default upon which, if not cured by us or waived by our lenders, our lenders may declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable. Such an acceleration of the maturity of our indebtedness may prevent or limit us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions and taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. The execution of our growth strategy is dependent upon the continued availability of credit and third-party financing arrangements for our customers.Economic downturns result in tighter credit markets, which could adversely affect our customers’ ability to secure financing or to secure financing at favorable terms or interest rates necessary to proceed or continue with purchases of our products and services. Our customers’ or potential customers’ inability to secure financing for projects could result in the delay, cancellation or downsizing of new purchases or the suspension of purchases already under contract, which could cause a decline in the demand for our products and services and negatively impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.6Table of ContentsOur efforts to develop new products and services or enhance existing products and services involve substantial research, development and marketing expenses, and the resulting new or enhanced products or services may not generate sufficient revenues to justify the expense.We place a high priority on developing new products and services, as well as enhancing our existing products and services. As a result of these efforts, we may be required to expend substantial research, development and marketing resources, and the time and expense required to develop a new product or service or enhance an existing product or service are difficult to predict. We may not succeed in developing, introducing or marketing new products or services or product or service enhancements. In addition, we cannot be certain that any new or enhanced product or service will generate sufficient revenue to justify the expense and resources devoted to this product diversification effort.We could incur restructuring and impairment charges as we continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure.We continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure. These actions could result in significant charges that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future actions could result in restructuring and related charges, including but not limited to impairments, employee termination costs and charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits and pension curtailments that could be significant and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.We operate in highly competitive markets.The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do. The intensity of this competition, which is expected to continue, can result in price discounting and margin pressures throughout the industry and may adversely affect our ability to increase or maintain prices for our products. In addition, certain of our competitors may have lower overall labor or material costs. In some cases, our contracts with municipal and other governmental customers are awarded and renewed through competitive bidding. We may not be successful in obtaining or renewing these contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability, warranty, recall claims, client service interruption or other lawsuits or claims that may be brought against us.We are exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the normal course of business in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. For example, we have been sued by firefighters seeking damages claiming that exposure to our sirens has impaired their hearing and that the sirens are, therefore, defective. In addition, we are subject to other claims and litigation from time to time as further described in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. We could experience material warranty or product liability costs in the future and incur significant costs to defend ourselves against these claims. While we carry insurance and maintain reserves for product liability claims, our insurance coverage may be inadequate if such claims do arise, and any defense costs and liability not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. A future claim could involve the imposition of punitive damages, the award of which, pursuant to state laws, may not be covered by insurance. In addition, warranty and certain other claims are not typically covered by insurance. Any product liability or warranty issues may adversely impact our reputation as a manufacturer of high quality, safe products and may have a material adverse effect on our business.Failure to keep pace with technological developments may adversely affect our operations.We are engaged in an industry that will be affected by future technological developments. The introduction of products or processes utilizing new technologies could render our existing products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. Our success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce on a timely and cost-effective basis new products, applications and processes that keep pace with technological developments and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. We may not be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products, applications and processes and product or process enhancements. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products, applications or processes. Our products, applications or processes may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected if we were to incur delays in developing new products, applications or processes or product or process enhancements, or if our products do not gain market acceptance.7Table of ContentsIncreased information technology security threats and more sophisticated cyber-attacks pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and operations.We have observed a global increase in information technology security threats and more sophisticated cyber-attacks. Our business could be impacted by such disruptions, which in turn could pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, accessibility and integrity of information stored and transmitted on those systems and networks. We have adopted measures to prevent cyber-attacks and mitigate potential risks to our systems from these information technology-related disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, our systems and networks remain potentially vulnerable to attacks. Depending on their nature and scope, such attacks could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information, misuse of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, production stoppages and supply shortages, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.Infringement of, or an inability to protect, our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems, physical security and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property and the intellectual property of certain customers and suppliers. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts to protect these intellectual property rights will be sufficient. Intellectual property protection is subject to applicable laws in various jurisdictions where interpretations and protections differ or can be unpredictable and costly to enforce. Further, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain foreign jurisdictions that do not have, or do not enforce, strong intellectual property rights. Any failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.The inability to obtain raw materials, component parts and/or finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner from suppliers would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products.We purchase from suppliers raw materials and component parts to be used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we purchase certain finished goods from suppliers. Changes in our relationships with suppliers, shortages, production delays, regulatory restrictions or work stoppages by the employees of such suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely manufacture and market products. In addition, increases in the costs of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions, delays, inefficiencies or our inability to market products. In addition, our profit margins would decrease if prices of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods increase and we are unable to pass on those increases to our customers.Our ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.Our ability to operate our businesses and implement our strategies depends in part on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. In addition, our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including finance personnel, research professionals, technical sales professionals and engineers. The loss of the services of any key employee or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business or business prospects.Disruptions within our dealer network could adversely affect our business.We rely on a national and global dealer network to market certain of our products and services. A disruption in our dealer network with a significant dealer or within a specific market could have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market. In addition, the loss or termination of a significant dealer, or significant number of dealers, could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our products and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.Our business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters.We are subject to risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters because a portion of our workforce is unionized. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 24% of our U.S. hourly workers were represented by labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Many of these agreements include provisions that limit our ability to realize cost savings. Any strikes, threats of strikes or other organized disruptions in connection with the negotiation of new labor agreements or other negotiations could materially adversely affect our business as well as impair our ability to implement further measures to reduce costs and improve production efficiencies. 8Table of ContentsOur pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside of our control, including the performance of plan assets, the discount rate used to value liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory changes.Our funding obligations and pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans are driven by the performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value the plans’ liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory funding requirements. Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. In addition, a portion of our pension plan assets are invested in equity securities, which can experience significant declines if financial markets weaken. The level of the funding of our defined benefit pension plan liabilities was approximately 77% as of December 31, 2014. The current year funding status was impacted by lower discount rates and revised mortality assumptions which project longer life expectancy. Our future pension expenses and funding requirements could increase significantly due to the effect of adverse changes in the discount rate, asset values or the estimated expected return on plan assets. In addition, we could be legally required to make increased cash contributions to the pension plans, and these contributions could be material and negatively affect our cash flow.The costs associated with complying with environmental and safety regulations could lower our margins.We, like other manufacturers, continue to face heavy governmental regulation of our products, especially in the areas of the environment and employee health and safety. Complying with environmental and safety requirements has added and will continue to add to the cost of our products, and could increase the capital required to support our business. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these laws and regulations, we may be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to our operations under existing laws or those that may be adopted. These requirements are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Therefore, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions as a result of violation of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and safety regulations.Our ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to reduce future tax payments could be negatively impacted if there is a change in our ownership or a failure to generate sufficient taxable income.Presently, the only U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) we have remaining are from previously acquired companies and hence are limited to specific annual amounts as permitted by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Section 382”). If an ownership change, as defined in Section 382, occurs with respect to our capital stock, our ability to use these NOLs could be further limited to more restrictive specific annual amounts. Generally, an ownership change occurs if certain persons or groups increase their aggregate ownership by more than 50% of our total capital stock in a three-year period. If more than a 50% ownership change were to occur, use of our NOLs to reduce payments of federal tax may be deferred to later years within the 20-year carryover period; however, if the carryover period for any loss year expires, the use of the remaining NOLs for the loss year will be prohibited. If we should fail to generate a sufficient level of taxable income prior to the expiration of the applicable NOL carryforward periods, then we will lose the ability to apply the NOLs as offsets to future taxable income. We also have a significant amount of tax credit carryforwards (“tax credits”) which are generally available to offset future U.S. income tax. The usage of these tax credits is subject to similar limitations upon a change in ownership. At December 31, 2014, our tax credits totaled $30.8 million and had carryforward periods generally ranging from 3 to 20 years. An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.We have a substantial amount of goodwill, which is recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, competition and market and general economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about our sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill recoverability. Goodwill reviews are prepared using estimates of the fair value of reporting units, which incorporate estimates of the present value of future discounted cash flow. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business or market capitalization declines.If the future operating performance of our reporting units is not consistent with our assumptions, we could be required to record non-cash impairment charges. Impairment charges could substantially affect our total consolidated assets and results of operations in the periods such charges are recorded. As of December 31, 2014, total consolidated goodwill was approximately 40% of total consolidated assets.9Table of ContentsWe may be unsuccessful in our future acquisitions, if any, which may have an adverse effect on our business.Our long-term strategy includes exploring acquisition of companies or businesses to facilitate our growth, enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Such acquisitions may help us expand into adjacent markets, add complementary products and services or allow us to leverage our distribution channels. In connection with this strategy, we could face certain risks and uncertainties in addition to those we face in the day-to-day operations of our business. We also may be unable to identify suitable targets for acquisition or to make acquisitions at favorable prices. If we identify a suitable acquisition candidate, our ability to successfully implement the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms. In addition, our acquisition activities could be disrupted by overtures from competitors for the targeted companies, governmental regulation and rapid developments in our industry that decrease the value of a potential target’s products or services.Acquisitions involve risks, including those associated with the following:•integrating the operations, financial reporting, disparate systems and processes and personnel of acquired companies;•managing geographically dispersed operations;•diverting management’s attention from other business concerns;•entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience; and•losing key employees, customers and strategic partners of acquired companies.We also may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits associated with our acquisitions. Acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of, among other things, the incurrence of debt, acquisition costs, impairment of goodwill and amortization of other intangible assets. In addition, future acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities.Businesses acquired by us may have liabilities that are not known to us.We may assume liabilities in connection with the acquisition of businesses. There may be liabilities that we fail or are unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the acquired businesses. In these circumstances, we cannot assure that our rights to indemnification from the sellers of the acquired businesses to us will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the businesses or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow"
8,FSS,FEDERAL SIGNAL CORP,2014-03-05,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
.We may occasionally make forward-looking statements and estimates such as forecasts and projections of our future performance or statements of our plans and objectives. These forward-looking statements may be contained in, but are not limited to, filings with the SEC, including this Form 10-K, press releases made by us, and oral statements made by our officers. Actual results could differ materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those contained in such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the risks described below.Our financial results are subject to U.S. economic uncertainty.In 2013, we generated approximately 65% of our net sales in the U.S. Our ability to be profitable depends heavily on varying conditions in the U.S. governmental and municipal markets and the overall U.S. economy. The industrial markets in which we compete are subject to considerable cyclicality, and move in response to cycles in the overall business environment. Many of 5Table of Contentsour customers are municipal government agencies, and as a result, we are dependent on municipal government spending. Spending by our municipal customers can be affected by local political circumstances, budgetary constraints and other factors. The U.S. government and municipalities depend heavily on tax revenues as a source of their spending and accordingly, there is a historical correlation of a one or two year lag between the overall strength of the U.S. economy and our sales to the U.S. government and municipalities. Therefore, downturns in the U.S. economy are likely to result in decreases in demand for our products. During previous economic downturns, we experienced decreases in sales and profitability, and we expect our business to remain subject to similar economic fluctuations in the future.We have international operations that are subject to foreign economic and political uncertainties and foreign currency rate fluctuations.Our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and changing international economic and political conditions that are beyond our control. In 2013, 35% of our net sales were generated outside the U.S. and we expect a significant portion of our revenues to come from international sales for the foreseeable future. Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks, including abrupt changes in foreign government policies and regulations, restrictive domestic and international trade regulations, U.S. laws applicable to foreign operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and the U.K. Bribery Act, political and economic instability, local labor market conditions, the imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade barriers and, in some cases, international hostilities. To the extent that our international operations are affected by unexpected and adverse foreign economic and political conditions, we may experience project disruptions and losses which could significantly reduce our revenues and profits. In addition, penalties for any such non-compliance with laws applicable to international business and trade, such as the FCPA, could negatively impact our business.Some of our contracts are denominated in foreign currencies, which results in additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange. Changes in the value of foreign currencies over the longer term could increase our U.S. dollar costs for, or reduce our U.S. dollar revenues from, our foreign operations. Any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect our profits.We are subject to a number of restrictive debt covenants.In March 2013, we entered into a credit facility for a period of five years ending March 2018. The proceeds from this credit facility were used to refinance the majority of the Company’s then existing indebtedness, including the Company’s secured credit facility and term loan. The new credit facility contains certain restrictive debt covenants and other customary events of default. Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants may be affected by the other factors described in this “Risk Factors
” section and other factors outside of our control. Failure to comply with one or more of these restrictive covenants may result in an event of default. Upon an event of default, if not cured by us or waived by our lenders, our lenders may declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable. If our current lenders thereby accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness, we may not have sufficient capital available at that time to pay the amounts due to our lenders on a timely basis. In addition, these restrictive covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions and taking advantage of attractive business opportunities.The execution of our growth strategy is dependent upon the continued availability of credit and third-party financing arrangements for our customers.Economic downturns result in tighter credit markets, which could adversely affect our customers’ ability to secure financing or to secure financing at favorable terms or interest rates necessary to proceed or continue with purchases of our products and services. Our customers’ or potential customers’ inability to secure financing for projects could result in the delay, cancellation or downsizing of new purchases or the suspension of purchases already under contract, which could cause a decline in the demand for our products and services and negatively impact our revenues and earnings.Our efforts to develop new products and services or enhance existing products and services involve substantial research, development and marketing expenses, and the resulting new or enhanced products or services may not generate sufficient revenues to justify the expense.We place a high priority on developing new products and services, as well as enhancing our existing products and services. As a result of these efforts, we may be required to expend substantial research, development and marketing resources, and the time and expense required to develop a new product or service or enhance an existing product or service are difficult to predict. We may not succeed in developing, introducing or marketing new products or services or product or service enhancements. In addition, we cannot be certain that any new or enhanced product or service will generate sufficient revenue to justify the expense and resources devoted to this product diversification effort.6Table of ContentsWe could incur restructuring and impairment charges as we continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure.We continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure. These actions could result in significant charges which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future actions could result in restructuring and related charges, including but not limited to impairments, employee termination costs and charges for pension and other postretirement contractual benefits and pension curtailments that could be significant. We have a substantial amount of goodwill, which is subject to periodic impairment analysis and review. Identifying and assessing whether impairment indicators exist, or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating results, competition and general economic conditions, requires significant judgment. Any of the above future actions could result in charges that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We operate in highly competitive markets.The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do. The intensity of this competition, which is expected to continue, can result in price discounting and margin pressures throughout the industry and may adversely affect our ability to increase or maintain prices for our products. In addition, certain of our competitors may have lower overall labor or material costs. In addition, our contracts with municipal and other governmental customers are in some cases awarded and renewed through competitive bidding. We may not be successful in obtaining or renewing these contracts, which could be harmful to our business and financial performance.We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability, warranty, recall claims, client service interruption or other lawsuits or claims that may be brought against us.We are exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the normal course of business in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, or the use of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury and/or property damage. For example, we have been sued by firefighters seeking damages claiming that exposure to our sirens has impaired their hearing and that the sirens are, therefore, defective. In addition, we are subject to other claims and litigation from time to time as further described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We could experience material warranty or product liability costs in the future and incur significant costs to defend ourselves against these claims. We carry insurance and maintain reserves for product liability claims. However, we cannot assure that our insurance coverage will be adequate if such claims do arise, and any defense costs and liability not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. A future claim could involve the imposition of punitive damages, the award of which, pursuant to state laws, may not be covered by insurance. In addition, warranty and certain other claims are not typically covered by insurance. Any product liability or warranty issues may adversely impact our reputation as a manufacturer of high quality, safe products and may have a material adverse effect on our business.Failure to keep pace with technological developments may adversely affect our operations.We are engaged in an industry which will be affected by future technological developments. The introduction of products or processes utilizing new technologies could render our existing products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. Our success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce on a timely and cost-effective basis new products, applications and processes that keep pace with technological developments and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. We may not be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products, applications and processes and product or process enhancements. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products, applications or processes. Our products, applications or processes may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if we were to incur delays in developing new products, applications or processes or product or process enhancements, or if our products do not gain market acceptance.The inability to obtain raw materials, component parts, and/or finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner from suppliers would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products.We purchase from suppliers raw materials and component parts to be used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we purchase certain finished goods from suppliers. Changes in our relationships with suppliers, shortages, production delays, regulatory restrictions or work stoppages by the employees of such suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely manufacture and market products. In addition, increases in the costs of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions, delays, inefficiencies or our inability to market products. In addition, our profit margins would decrease if prices of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods increase and we are unable to pass on those increases to our customers.7Table of ContentsOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.Our ability to operate our businesses and implement our strategies depends in part on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. In addition, our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including finance personnel, research professionals, technical sales professionals and engineers. The loss of the services of any key employee or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business or business prospects.Disruptions within our dealer network could adversely affect our business.We rely on a national and global dealer network to market certain of our products and services. A disruption in our dealer network within a specific local market could have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market. In addition, the loss or termination of a significant number of dealers could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our products and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters.We are subject to risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters because a portion of our workforce is unionized. As of December 31, 2013, approximately 26% of our U.S. hourly workers were represented by labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Many of these agreements include provisions that limit our ability to realize cost savings. Any strikes, threats of strikes, or other resistance in connection with the negotiation of new labor agreements or otherwise could materially adversely affect our business as well as impair our ability to implement further measures to reduce structural costs and improve production efficiencies. Our pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside of our control, including the performance of plan assets, the discount rate used to value liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory changes.Our funding obligations and pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans are driven by the performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value the plans’ liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory funding requirements. Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, liquidity or shareholders’ equity. In addition, a portion of our pension plan assets are invested in equity securities, which can experience significant declines if financial markets weaken. The level of the funding of our defined benefit pension plan liabilities was approximately 88% as of December 31, 2013. Our future pension expenses and funding requirements could increase significantly due to the effect of adverse changes in the discount rate, asset values, or the estimated expected return on plan assets. In addition, the Company could be legally required to make increased contributions to the pension plans, and these contributions could be material and negatively affect our cash flow.The costs associated with complying with environmental and safety regulations could lower our margins.We, like other manufacturers, continue to face heavy governmental regulation of our products, especially in the areas of the environment and employee health and safety. Complying with environmental and safety requirements has added and will continue to add to the cost of our products, and could increase the capital required to support our business. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these laws and regulations, we may be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to our operations under existing laws or those that may be adopted. These requirements are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Therefore, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions as a result of violation of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and safety regulations.Our ability to use NOL carryovers to reduce future tax payments could be negatively impacted if there is a change in our ownership or a failure to generate sufficient taxable income.Presently, the only U.S. federal NOLs we have remaining are from previously acquired companies and hence are limited to specific annual amounts as required by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Section 382”). Additionally, if an ownership change, as defined in Section 382, occurs with respect to our capital stock, our ability to use these NOLs would be additionally limited to more restrictive specific annual amounts. Generally, an ownership change occurs if certain persons or groups increase their aggregate ownership by more than 50% of our total capital stock in a three-year period. If an ownership change occurs, our ability to use domestic NOLs to reduce taxable income is generally limited to an annual amount based on the fair market value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt interest rate. NOLs that exceed the Section 382 limitation in any year continue to be allowed as carryforwards for the remainder of the 20-year carryforward period and can be used to offset taxable income for years within the carryover period 8Table of Contentssubject to the limitation in each year. Our use of new NOLs arising after the date of an ownership change would not be affected. If more than a 50% ownership change were to occur, use of our NOLs to reduce payments of federal taxable income may be deferred to later years within the 20-year carryover period; however, if the carryover period for any loss year expires, the use of the remaining NOLs for the loss year will be prohibited. If we should fail to generate a sufficient level of taxable income prior to the expiration of the NOL carryforward periods, then we will lose the ability to apply the NOLs as offsets to future taxable income.An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.Goodwill is recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, and market and economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about our sales, operating margins, growth rates, and discount rates. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill recoverability. Goodwill reviews are prepared using estimates of the fair value of reporting units, which incorporate estimates of the present value of future discounted cash flows. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business, or market capitalization declines.If the future operating performance of our reporting units is not consistent with our assumptions, we could be required to record non-cash impairment charges. Impairment charges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the periods such charges are recorded. As of December 31, 2013, total consolidated goodwill was approximately 42% of total consolidated assets.We may be unsuccessful in our future acquisitions, if any, which may have an adverse effect on our business.Our long-term strategy includes expanding into adjacent markets through selective acquisitions of companies, or of complementary products and services, that could enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. This strategy may involve the acquisition of companies that, among other things, enable us to build on our existing strength in a market or that give us access to proprietary products and services that are strategically valuable or allow us to leverage our distribution channels. In connection with this strategy, we could face certain risks and uncertainties in addition to those we face in the day-to-day operations of our business. We also may be unable to identify suitable targets for acquisition or make acquisitions at favorable prices. If we identify a suitable acquisition candidate, our ability to successfully implement the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms. In addition, our acquisition activities could be disrupted by overtures from competitors for the targeted companies, governmental regulation, and rapid developments in our industry that decrease the value of a target’s products or services.Acquisitions involve risks, including those associated with the following:•integrating the operations, financial reporting, disparate systems and processes and personnel of acquired companies;•managing geographically dispersed operations;•diverting management’s attention from other business concerns;•entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience; and•potentially losing key employees, customers and strategic partners of acquired companies.We also may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits. Acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of, among other things, the incurrence of debt, write-offs of goodwill and amortization expenses of other intangible assets. In addition, future acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities.Businesses acquired by us may have liabilities which are not known to us.We may assume liabilities in connection with the acquisition of businesses. There may be liabilities that we fail or are unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the acquired businesses. In these circumstances, we cannot assure that our rights to indemnification from sellers of the acquired businesses to us will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the businesses or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business"
7,FSS,FEDERAL SIGNAL CORP,2013-03-15,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
.  We may occasionally make forward-lookingstatements and estimates such as forecasts and projections of our future performance or statements of our plans and objectives. These forward-looking statements may be contained in, among other things, filings with the SEC, including thisForm 10-K, press releases made by us and in oral statements made by our officers. Actual results could differ materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differfrom those contained in such forward-looking statements include, among other things, the risks described below.  Ourfinancial results are subject to U.S. economic uncertainty.  In 2012, we generated approximately 61% of our sales in theU.S. Our ability to be profitable depends heavily on varying conditions in the U.S. governmental and municipal markets and the overall U.S. economy. The industrial markets in which we compete are subject to considerable cyclicality, and move inresponse to cycles in the overall business environment. Many of our customers are municipal government agencies, and as a result, we are dependent on municipal government spending. Spending by our municipal customers can be  6 affected by local political circumstances, budgetary constraints and other factors. The U.S. government and municipalities depend heavily on tax revenues as a source of their spending andaccordingly, there is a historical correlation of a one or two year lag between the overall strength of the U.S. economy and our sales to the U.S. government and municipalities. Therefore, downturns in the U.S. economy are likely to result indecreases in demand for our products. During previous economic downturns, we experienced decreases in sales and profitability, and we expect our business to remain subject to similar economic fluctuations in the future. We have international operations that are subject to foreign economic and political uncertainties and foreign currency ratefluctuations.  Our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and changing international economic and politicalconditions that are beyond our control. In 2012, 39% of our sales were generated outside the U.S. and we expect a significant portion of our revenues to come from international sales for the foreseeable future. Operating in the internationalmarketplace exposes us to a number of risks, including abrupt changes in foreign government policies and regulations, restrictive domestic and international trade regulations, U.S. laws applicable to foreign operations, such as the ForeignCorrupt Practices Act (the FCPA) and the UK Bribery Act, political and economic instability, local labor market conditions, the imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade barriers and, in some cases, international hostilities. To theextent that our international operations are affected by unexpected and adverse foreign economic and political conditions, we may experience project disruptions and losses which could significantly reduce our revenues and profits. In addition,penalties for non-compliance with laws applicable to international business and trade, such as the FCPA, could negatively impact our business.  Some of our contracts are denominated in foreign currencies, which results in additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange.Changes in the value of foreign currencies over the longer term could increase our U.S. dollar costs for, or reduce our U.S. dollar revenues from, our foreign operations. Any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreigncurrency fluctuations could adversely affect our profits.  We are subject to a number of restrictive debt covenants. We recently entered into a credit facility in March 2013 for a period of five years ending March 2018. The proceeds fromthis credit facility were used to refinance the majority of the Companys existing indebtedness, including the Companys secured credit facility and term loan. The new credit facility contains certain restrictive debt covenants and othercustomary events of default. Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants may be affected by the other factors described in this Risk Factors
 section and other factors outside of our control. Failure to comply with one or moreof these restrictive covenants may result in an event of default. Upon an event of default, if not waived by our lenders, our lenders may declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable. If our current lenders accelerate the maturity of ourindebtedness, we may not have sufficient capital available at that time to pay the amounts due to our lenders on a timely basis. In addition, these restrictive covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, includingresponding to changing business and economic conditions and taking advantage of attractive business opportunities.  Theexecution of our growth strategy is dependent upon the continued availability of credit and third-party financing arrangements for our customers.  Economic downturns result in tighter credit markets, which could adversely affect our customers ability to secure financing or to secure financing at favorable terms or interest rates necessary toproceed or continue with purchases of our products and services. Our customers or potential customers inability to secure financing for projects could result in the delay, cancellation or downsizing of new purchases or the suspension ofpurchases already under contract, which could cause a decline in the demand for our products and services and negatively impact our revenues and earnings.   7 Our efforts to develop new products and services or enhance existing products andservices involve substantial research, development and marketing expenses, and the resulting new or enhanced products or services may not generate sufficient revenues to justify the expense. We place a high priority on developing new products and services, as well as enhancing our existing products and services. As a result ofthese efforts, we may be required to expend substantial research, development and marketing resources, and the time and expense required to develop a new product or service or enhance an existing product or service are difficult to predict. We maynot succeed in developing, introducing or marketing new products or services or product or service enhancements. In addition, we cannot be certain that any new or enhanced product or service will generate sufficient revenue to justify the expenseand resources devoted to this product diversification effort.  We could incur restructuring and impairment charges as wecontinue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure.  We continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure. These actions could result in significantcharges which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future actions could result in restructuring and related charges, including but not limited to impairments, employee termination costs and charges for pensionand other postretirement contractual benefits and pension curtailments that could be significant. We have substantial amounts of long-lived assets, including goodwill, which are subject to periodic impairment analysis and review. Identifying andassessing whether impairment indicators exist, or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating results, competition and general economic conditions, requires significant judgment. Any of the abovefuture actions could result in charges that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We operate in highly competitive markets.  The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do. The intensity of this competition, which is expected to continue,can result in price discounting and margin pressures throughout the industry and may adversely affect our ability to increase or maintain prices for our products. In addition, certain of our competitors may have lower overall labor or materialcosts. In addition, our contracts with municipal and other governmental customers are in some cases awarded and renewed through competitive bidding. We may not be successful in obtaining or renewing these contracts, which could be harmful to ourbusiness and financial performance.  We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability, warranty,recall claims, client service interruption or other lawsuits or claims that may be brought against us.  We are exposed toproduct liability and warranty claims in the normal course of business in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, or the use of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury and/or propertydamage. For example, we have been sued by firefighters seeking damages claiming that exposure to our sirens has impaired their hearing and that the sirens are, therefore, defective. In addition, we are subject to other claims and litigation fromtime to time as further described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We could experience material warranty or product liability costs in the future and incur significant costs to defend against these claims. We carry insuranceand maintain reserves for product liability claims. However, we cannot assure that our insurance coverage will be adequate if such claims do arise, and any defense costs and liability not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact onour financial position and results of operations. A future claim could involve the imposition of punitive damages, the award of which, pursuant to state laws, may not be covered by insurance. In addition, warranty or other claims are not typicallycovered by insurance. Any product liability or warranty issues may adversely impact our reputation as a manufacturer of high quality, safe products and may have a material adverse effect on our business.   8 Failure to keep pace with technological developments may adversely affect our operations. We are engaged in an industry which will be affected by future technological developments. The introduction of products orprocesses utilizing new technologies could render our existing products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. Our success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce on a timely and cost-effective basis new products, applications andprocesses that keep pace with technological developments and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. We may not be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products, applications and processes and product or processenhancements. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products, applications or processes. Our products, applications or processesmay not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if we were to incur delays in developing new products,applications or processes or product or process enhancements, or if our products do not gain market acceptance.  Theinability to obtain raw materials, component parts, and/or finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner from suppliers would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products. We purchase from suppliers raw materials and component parts to be used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we purchasecertain finished goods from suppliers. Changes in our relationships with suppliers, shortages, production delays, regulatory restrictions or work stoppages by the employees of such suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our ability totimely manufacture and market products. In addition, increases in the costs of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions, delays, inefficiencies or our inability to market products. Inaddition, our profit margins would decrease if prices of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods increase and we are unable to pass on those increases to our customers. Our ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel. Our ability to operate our businesses and implement our strategies depends in part on the efforts of our executive officers and other keyemployees. In addition, our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including finance personnel, research professionals, technical sales professionals and engineers. The loss of theservices of any key employee or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business or business prospects.  Disruptions within our dealer network could adversely affect our business. We rely on a national and global dealer network to market certain of our products and services. A disruption in our dealer network withina specific local market could temporarily have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market. In addition, the loss or termination of a significant number of dealers could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our productsand have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  Our business may be adverselyimpacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters.  We are subject to risk of work stoppages and other laborrelations matters because a portion of our workforce is unionized. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 28% of our U.S. hourly workers are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Many of theseagreements include provisions that limit our ability to realize cost savings. Any strikes, threats of strikes, or other resistance in connection with the negotiation of new labor agreements or otherwise could materially adversely affect our businessas well as impair our ability to implement further measures to reduce structural costs and improve production efficiencies. We believe that our labor relations with our employees are good.   9 Our pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside ofour control, including the performance of plan assets, the discount rate used to value liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory changes.  Our funding obligations and pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans are driven by the performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value theplans liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory funding requirements. Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, liquidity or shareholders equity. In addition, aportion of our pension plan assets are invested in equity securities, which can experience significant declines if financial markets weaken. The level of the funding of our defined benefit pension plan liabilities was approximately 69% as ofDecember 31, 2012. Our future pension expenses and funding requirements could increase significantly due to the effect of adverse changes in the discount rate and asset levels along with a decline in the estimated return on plan assets. Inaddition, the Company could be legally required to make increased contributions to the pension plans, and these contributions could be material and negatively affect our cash flow. The costs associated with complying with environmental and safety regulations could lower our margins. We, like other manufacturers, continue to face heavy governmental regulation of our products, especially in the areas of the environmentand employee health and safety. Complying with environmental and safety requirements has added and will continue to add to the cost of our products, and could increase the capital required to support our business. While we believe that we are incompliance in all material respects with these laws and regulations, we may be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to our operations under existing laws or those that may be adopted. These requirements are complex, changefrequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Therefore, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions as a result of violation of, or liabilities under, environmental laws andsafety regulations.  Our ability to use NOL carryovers to reduce future tax payments could be negatively impacted if thereis a change in our ownership or a failure to generate sufficient taxable income.  Presently, there is no annual limitationon our ability to use U.S. federal NOLs to reduce future income taxes. However, if an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, occurs with respect to our capital stock, our ability to useNOLs would be limited to specific annual amounts. Generally, an ownership change occurs if certain persons or groups increase their aggregate ownership by more than 50% of our total capital stock in a three-year period. If an ownership changeoccurs, our ability to use domestic NOLs to reduce taxable income is generally limited to an annual amount based on the fair market value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt interest rate.NOLs that exceed the Section 382 limitation in any year continue to be allowed as carryforwards for the remainder of the 20-year carryforward period and can be used to offset taxable income for years within the carryover period subject to thelimitation in each year. Our use of new NOLs arising after the date of an ownership change would not be affected. If more than a 50% ownership change were to occur, use of our NOLs to reduce payments of federal taxable income may be deferred tolater years within the 20-year carryover period; however, if the carryover period for any loss year expires, the use of the remaining NOLs for the loss year will be prohibited. If we should fail to generate a sufficient level of taxable income priorto the expiration of the NOL carryforward periods, then we will lose the ability to apply the NOLs as offsets to future taxable income.  An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, trade names and other long-lived assets could negatively affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are notamortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and trade names, we make   10 assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends and market and economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about our sales, operatingmargins, growth rates and discount rates. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and trade name recoverability. Goodwill reviews are prepared using estimates of the fairvalue of reporting units based on the estimated present value of future discounted cash flows. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill or trade names prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to thebusiness, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business or market capitalization declines.  We also continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets maywarrant revision or whether the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable. We use an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable. If the future operating performance of our reporting units is not consistent with our assumptions, we could be required to recordnon-cash impairment charges. Impairment charges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the periods such charges are recorded. As of December 31, 2012, total consolidated goodwill was approximately 44% of total consolidated assets. We may be unsuccessful in our future acquisitions, if any, which may have an adverse effect on our business. Our long-term strategy includes expanding into adjacent markets through selective acquisitions of companies, complementaryproducts and services, as well as organic growth in order to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. This strategy may involve the acquisition of companies that, among other things, enable us to build on our existingstrength in a market or that give us access to proprietary products and services that are strategically valuable or allow us to leverage our distribution channels. In connection with this strategy, we could face certain risks and uncertainties inaddition to those we face in the day-to-day operations of our business. We also may be unable to identify suitable targets for acquisition or make acquisitions at favorable prices. If we identify a suitable acquisition candidate, our ability tosuccessfully implement the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms. In addition, our acquisition activities could be disrupted by overtures from competitors for the targetedcompanies, governmental regulation and rapid developments in our industry that decrease the value of a targets products or services.  Acquisitions involve risks, including those associated with the following:      integrating the operations, financial reporting, disparate systems and processes and personnel of acquired companies;     managing geographically dispersed operations;      diverting managements attention from other business concerns;     entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience; and     potentially losing key employees, customers and strategic partners of acquired companies. We also may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits. Acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negativelyimpact our results of operations as a result of, among other things, the incurrence of debt, write-offs of goodwill and amortization expenses of other intangible assets. In addition, future acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equitysecurities.   11 Businesses acquired by us may have liabilities which are not known to us. We may assume liabilities in connection with the acquisition of businesses. There may be liabilities that we fail or are unable todiscover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the acquired businesses. In these circumstances, we cannot assure that our rights to indemnification from sellers of the acquired businesses to us will be sufficient in amount,scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the businesses or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business"

. We may occasionally make forward-looking statements and estimates such as forecasts and projections of our future performance orstatements of our plans and objectives. These forward-looking statements may be contained in, among other things, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including this Annual Report on Form 10-K, press releasesmade by us and in oral statements made by our officers. Actual results could differ materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those contained in suchforward-looking statements include, among other things, the risks described below.  Our financial results are subject toconsiderable cyclicality.  In 2011, we generated approximately 63% of our sales in the United States. Our ability to beprofitable depends heavily on varying conditions in the United States government and municipal markets and the overall United States economy. The industrial markets in which we compete are subject to considerable cyclicality, and move in response tocycles in the overall business environment. Many of our customers are municipal governmental agencies, and as a result, we are dependent on municipal government spending. Spending by our municipal customers can be affected by local politicalcircumstances, budgetary constraints, and other factors. The United States government and municipalities depend heavily on tax revenues as a source of their spending and accordingly, there is a historical correlation of a one or two year lag betweenthe overall strength of the United States economy and our sales to the United States government and municipalities. Therefore, downturns in the United States economy are likely to result in decreases in demand for our products. During previouseconomic downturns, we experienced decreases in sales and profitability, and we expect our business to remain subject to similar economic fluctuations in the future.  We have international operations that are subject to foreign economic and political uncertainties.  Our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and changing international economic and political conditions that are beyond our control. In 2011, 37% of our sales were generated outside the UnitedStates and we expect a significant portion of our revenues to come from international sales for the foreseeable future. Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks, including abrupt changes in foreign governmentpolicies and regulations, restrictive domestic and international trade regulations, U.S. laws applicable to foreign operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act, political, religious and economicinstability, local labor market conditions, the imposition of foreign tariffs and other trade barriers and, in some cases, international hostilities. To the extent that our international operations are affected by unexpected and adverse foreigneconomic and political conditions, we may experience project disruptions and losses which could significantly reduce our revenues and profits. In addition, penalties for non-compliance with laws applicable to international business and trade, suchas FCPA, could negatively impact our business.  Some of our contracts are denominated in foreign currencies, which results inadditional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange. Changes in the   6 Table of Contentsvalue of foreign currencies over the longer term could increase our U.S. dollar costs for, or reduce our U.S. dollar revenues from, our foreign operations. Any increased costs orreduced revenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect our profits.  We are subject to anumber of restrictive debt covenants.  We recently entered into new credit facilities for a period of five years endingFebruary 2017. The proceeds from these new credit facilities were used to refinance the majority of the Companys existing indebtedness, including the Companys secured revolving credit facility and private placement notes. Our new creditfacilities contain certain restrictive debt covenants and other customary events of default. Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants may be affected by the other factors described in this Risk Factors
 section and otherfactors outside of our control. Failure to comply with one or more of these restrictive covenants may result in an event of default. Upon an event of default, if not waived by our lenders, our lenders may declare all amounts outstanding as due andpayable. If our current lenders accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness, we may not have sufficient capital available at that time to pay the amounts due to our lenders on a timely basis. In addition, these restrictive covenants may prevent usfrom engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions and taking advantage of attractive business opportunities.  The execution of our growth strategy is dependent upon the continued availability of credit and third-party financing arrangements for our customers. Economic downturns result in tighter credit markets, which could adversely affect our customers ability to secure the financing orto secure the financing at favorable terms or interest rates necessary to proceed or continue with purchases of our products and services. Our customers or potential customers inability to secure financing for projects could result inthe delay, cancellation or down-sizing of new purchases or the suspension of purchases already under contract, which could cause a decline in the demand for our products and services and negatively impact our revenues and earnings. Our efforts to develop new products and services or enhance existing products and services involve substantial research, developmentand marketing expenses, and the resulting new or enhanced products or services may not generate sufficient revenues to justify the expense.  We place a high priority on developing new products and services, as well as enhancing our existing products and services. As a result of these efforts, we may be required to expend substantial research,development and marketing resources, and the time and expense required to develop a new product or service or enhance an existing product or service are difficult to predict. We may not succeed in developing, introducing or marketing new products orservices or product or service enhancements. In addition, we cannot be certain that any new or enhanced product or service will generate sufficient revenue to justify the expense and resources devoted to this product diversification effort. We could incur restructuring and impairment charges as we continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our businessand rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize the cost structure.  We continue to evaluateopportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to optimize the cost structure which could include, among other actions, additional rationalization of our manufacturing operations. These actionscould result in significant charges which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Future actions could result in restructuring and related charges, including but not limited to impairments, employee terminationcosts and charges for pension and other post retirement contractual benefits and pension curtailments that could be significant. We have substantial amounts of long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets, which are subject toperiodic impairment analysis and review. Identifying and assessing whether impairment indicators exist, or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating results, competition and general economicconditions, requires significant judgment. Any of the above future actions could result in charges that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.   7 Table of ContentsWe operate in highly competitive markets. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than theCompany. The intensity of this competition, which is expected to continue, can result in price discounting and margin pressures throughout the industry and may adversely affect our ability to increase or maintain prices for our products. Inaddition, certain of our competitors may have lower overall labor or material costs. In addition, our contracts with municipal and other governmental customers are in some cases awarded and renewed through competitive bidding. We may not besuccessful in obtaining or renewing these contracts, which could be harmful to our business and financial performance.  Wemay incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability, warranty, recall claims, client service interruption or other lawsuits or claims that may be brought against us. We are exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the normal course of business in the event that our products actually orallegedly fail to perform as expected, or the use of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury and/or property damage. For example, we have been sued by firefighters seeking damages claiming that exposure to our sirens hasimpaired their hearing and that the sirens are therefore defective. In addition, we are subject to other claims and litigation from time to time as further described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. In addition, we couldexperience material liability or contractual damage costs due to software or service interruption in our FSTech business. We could experience material warranty or product liability costs in the future and incur significant costs to defend againstthese claims. We carry insurance and maintain reserves for product liability claims. However, we cannot assure that our insurance coverage will be adequate if such claims do arise, and any defense costs and liability not covered by insurance couldhave a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. A future claim could involve the imposition of punitive damages, the award of which, pursuant to state laws, may not be covered by insurance. In addition, warrantyor other claims are not typically covered by insurance. Any product liability or warranty issues may adversely impact our reputation as a manufacturer of high quality, safe products and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Failure to keep pace with technological developments may adversely affect our operations. We are engaged in an industry which will be affected by future technological developments. The introduction of products or processesutilizing new technologies could render our existing products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. Our success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce on a timely and cost-effective basis new products, applications and processes thatkeep pace with technological developments and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. We may not be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products, applications and processes and product or process enhancements.We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products, applications or processes. Our products, applications or processes may notadequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if we were to incur delays in developing new products, applicationsor processes or product or process enhancements, or if our products do not gain market acceptance.  The inability to obtainraw materials, component parts, and/or finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner from suppliers would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and market our products. We purchase raw materials and component parts from suppliers to be used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we purchasecertain finished goods from suppliers. Changes in our relationships with suppliers, shortages, production delays or work stoppages by the employees of such suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely manufacture andmarket products. In addition, increases in the costs of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions,   8 Table of Contentsdelays, inefficiencies or our inability to market products. In addition, our profit margins would decrease if prices of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods increase and weare unable to pass on those increases to our customers.  Our ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail toattract and retain key personnel.  Our ability to operate our businesses and implement our strategies depends in part onthe efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. In addition, our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including finance personnel, research professionals, technicalsales professionals and engineers. The loss of the services of any key employee or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business or business prospects. Disruptions within our dealer network could adversely affect our business. We rely on a national and global dealer network to market certain of our products and services. A disruption in our dealer network withina specific local market could temporarily have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market. In addition, the loss or termination of a significant number of dealers could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our productsand have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.  Our business may be adverselyimpacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters.  We are subject to risk of work stoppages and other laborrelations matters because a portion of our workforce is unionized. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 26% of our U.S. hourly workers are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Many of theseagreements include provisions that limit our ability to realize cost savings. Any strikes, threats of strikes, or other resistance in connection with the negotiation of new labor agreements or otherwise could materially adversely affect our businessas well as impair our ability to implement further measures to reduce structural costs and improve production efficiencies. On April 30, 2012, the current collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workersat our University Park, Illinois facility expires.  Our pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certainfactors outside of our control, including the performance of plan assets, the discount rate used to value liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory changes. Our funding obligations and pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans are driven by the performance of assets set aside intrusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value the plans liabilities, actuarial assumptions and experience and legal and regulatory funding requirements. Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on our results ofoperations, liquidity or shareholders equity. In addition, a portion our pension plan assets are invested in equity securities which can experience significant declines if financial markets weaken. The level of the funding of our definedbenefit pension plan liabilities was approximately 68% as of December 31, 2011. Our future pension expenses and funding requirements could increase significantly due to the effect of adverse changes in the discount rate and asset levels alongwith a decline in the estimated return on plan assets. In addition, the Company could be legally required to make increased contributions to the pension plans, and these contributions could be material and negatively affect our cash flow. The costs associated with complying with environmental and safety regulations could lower our margins. We, like other manufacturers, continue to face heavy governmental regulation of our products, especially in the areas of the environmentand employee health and safety. Complying with environmental and safety requirements has added and will continue to add to the cost of our products, and could increase the capital required. While we believe that we are in compliance in all materialrespects with these laws and regulations, we   9 Table of Contentsmay be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to our operations under existing laws or those that may be adopted. These requirements are complex, change frequently andhave tended to become more stringent over time. Therefore, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions as a result of violation of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and safety regulations. Our ability to use net operating loss (NOL) carryovers to reduce future tax payments could be negativelyimpacted if there is a change in our ownership or a failure to generate sufficient taxable income.  Presently, there is noannual limitation on our ability to use U.S. federal NOLs to reduce future income taxes. However, if an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, occurs with respect to our capital stock,our ability to use NOLs would be limited to specific annual amounts. Generally, an ownership change occurs if certain persons or groups increase their aggregate ownership by more than 50 percentage points of our total capital stock in athree-year period. If an ownership change occurs, our ability to use domestic NOLs to reduce taxable income is generally limited to an annual amount based on the fair market value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied bythe long-term tax-exempt interest rate. NOLs that exceed the Section 382 limitation in any year continue to be allowed as carry forwards for the remainder of the 20-year carry forward period and can be used to offset taxable income for yearswithin the carryover period subject to the limitation in each year. Our use of new NOLs arising after the date of an ownership change would not be affected. If more than a 50% ownership change were to occur, use of our NOLs to reduce payments offederal taxable income may be deferred to later years within the 20-year carryover period; however, if the carryover period for any loss year expires, the use of the remaining NOLs for the loss year will be prohibited. If we should fail to generatea sufficient level of taxable income prior to the expiration of the NOL carry forward periods, then we will lose the ability to apply the NOLs as offsets to future taxable income. An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, trade names and other long-lived assets could negatively affect our consolidatedresults of operations and net worth.  Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as trade names, are recorded atfair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and trade names, we makeassumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends and market and economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about our sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates. There areinherent uncertainties related to these factors and in applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and trade name recoverability. Goodwill reviews are prepared using estimates of the fair value of reporting units based on the estimatedpresent value of future discounted cash flows. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill or trade names prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operatingresults, a divestiture of a significant component of our business or market capitalization declines.  We also continuallyevaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of its definite-lived intangible assets, excluding goodwill, and other long-lived assets may warrant revision or whether the remaining balanceof such assets may not be recoverable. We use an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable. In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company recognized $14.8 million and $7.4 million of impairment charges on goodwill and trade names,respectively, within the FSTech segment. The impairment charges are estimates and may be adjusted during the first quarter of 2012 upon completion of a detailed impairment analysis. The Company also recorded goodwill and trade name impairmentcharges of $67.1 million and $11.8 million, respectively, within the FSTech segment in 2010. An adjustment of $1.6 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2011 to reduce the goodwill impairment charge recognized in 2010 upon completion of adetailed step   10 Table of Contentstwo analysis. If the future operating performance of our reporting units is not consistent with our assumptions, we could be required to record additional non-cash impairment charges. Impairmentcharges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the periods such charges are recorded. As of December 31, 2011, total consolidated goodwill was approximately 42% of total consolidated assets. We may be unsuccessful in our future acquisitions, if any, which may have an adverse effect on our business. Our long-term strategy includes expanding into adjacent markets through selective acquisitions of companies, complementary products andservices as well as organic growth in order to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. This strategy may involve the acquisition of companies that, among other things, enable us to build on our existing strength in amarket or that give us access to proprietary products and services that are strategically valuable or allow us to leverage our distribution channels. In connection with this strategy, we could face certain risks and uncertainties in addition tothose we face in the day-to-day operations of our business. We also may be unable to identify suitable targets for acquisition or make acquisitions at favorable prices. If we identify a suitable acquisition candidate, our ability to successfullyimplement the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms. In addition, our acquisition activities could be disrupted by overtures from competitors for the targeted companies,governmental regulation and rapid developments in our industry that decrease the value of a targets products or services. Acquisitions involve risks, including those associated with the following:     integrating the operations, financial reporting, disparate systems and processes and personnel of acquired companies;     managing geographically dispersed operations;      diverting managements attention from other business concerns;     entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience; and     potentially losing key employees, customers and strategic partners of acquired companies. We also may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits. Acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negativelyimpact our results of operations as a result of, among other things, the incurrence of debt, write-offs of goodwill, and amortization expenses of other intangible assets. In addition, future acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equitysecurities.  Businesses acquired by us may have liabilities which are not known to us. We may assume liabilities in connection with the acquisition of businesses. There may be liabilities that we fail or are unable todiscover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the acquired businesses. In these circumstances, we cannot assure that our rights to indemnification from sellers of the acquired businesses to us will be sufficient in amount,scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the businesses or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business"
6,FSS,FEDERAL SIGNAL CORP,2011-03-16,">Item 1A. Risk    Factors.     We may occasionally make forward-looking statements and    estimates such as forecasts and projections of our future    performance or statements of our plans and objectives. These    forward-looking statements may be contained in, among other    things, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,    including this Annual Report on    Form 10-K,    press releases made by us and in oral statements made by our    officers. Actual results could differ materially from those    contained in such forward-looking statements. Important factors    that could cause our actual results to differ from those    contained in such forward-looking statements include, among    other things, the risks described below. Our    financial results are subject to considerable    cyclicality.     Our ability to be profitable depends heavily on varying    conditions in the United States government and municipal markets    and the overall United States economy. The industrial markets in    which we compete are subject to considerable cyclicality, and    move in response to cycles in the overall business environment.    Many of our customers are municipal governmental agencies, and    as a result, we are dependent on municipal government spending.    Spending by our municipal customers can be affected by local    political circumstances, budgetary constraints, and other    factors. The United States government and municipalities depend    heavily on tax revenues as a source of their spending and    accordingly, there is a historical correlation of a one or two    year lag between the overall strength of the United States    economy and our sales to the United States government and    municipalities. Therefore, downturns in the United States    economy are likely to result in decreases in demand for our    products. During    5Table of Contents    previous economic downturns, we experienced decreases in sales    and profitability, and we expect our business to remain subject    to similar economic fluctuations in the future. We were    not incompliance with our restrictive debt covenants as of    December 31, 2010.     Our revolving credit facility and other debt instruments contain    certain restrictive debt covenants and other customary events of    default. These restrictive covenants include, among other    things, an interest coverage ratio of 3.0:1.0 in all quarters    and a maximum    debt-to-total-capitalization    ratio of 0.5:1.0 as of December 31, 2010.     The Company was in violation of its Interest Coverage Ratio    covenant minimum requirement as defined in the Second Amended    and restated Credit Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreements    for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2010.     On March 15, 2011, the Company executed the Third Amendment    and Waiver to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated    as of April 25, 2007, among the Company, the lenders party    thereto, and Bank of Montreal, as Agent (the Third    Amendment and Waiver). On the same date, the Company also    executed the Second Global Amendment and Waiver to the Note    Purchase Agreements (Second Global Amendment) with    the holders of its private placement notes (the    Notes). Both the Third Amendment and Waiver and the    Second Global Amendment include a permanent waiver of compliance    with the Interest Coverage Ratio covenant for the Companys    fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2010. Included in the    terms of the Third Amendment and Waiver and the Second Global    Amendment are the replacement of the Interest Coverage Ratio    covenant with a minimum EBITDA covenant effective    January 1, 2011 with the first required reporting period on    April 2, 2011, an increase in pricing to the Companys    revolving Credit Facility pricing grid, an increase in pricing    for the outstanding Notes, mandatory prepayments from proceeds    of asset sales, restrictions on use of excess cash flow,    restrictions on dividend payments, share repurchases and other    restricted payments and a 50 basis points fee paid to the    bank lenders and holders of Notes upon execution of the Third    Amendment and Waiver and the Second Global Amendment. There can    be no assurance that we will be able to meet all of the revised    financial covenants and other conditions required by our Credit    Agreements in the future. In the event of a future default, our    lenders may not grant additional waivers of future covenant    violations and declare all amounts outstanding as due and    payable, which would negatively impact our liquidity and our    ability to operate. In addition, financial and other covenants    we have with our lenders will limit our ability to incur    additional indebtedness, make investments, pay dividends and    engage in other transactions, and the leverage may cause    potential lenders to be less willing to loan funds to us in the    future.   We    rely on access to financial markets to finance a portion of our    working capital requirements and support our liquidity needs.    Access to these markets may be adversely affected by factors    beyond our control, including turmoil in the financial services    industry, volatility in securities trading markets and general    economic downturns.     We draw upon our revolving credit facility and our operating    cash flow to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures,    strategic acquisitions, pension contributions, debt repayments,    share repurchases and dividends. Market disruptions such as    those recently experienced in the United States and abroad have    materially impacted liquidity in the credit and debt markets,    making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and in    certain cases resulting in the unavailability of certain types    of financing. Continued uncertainty in the financial markets may    negatively impact our ability to access additional financing or    to refinance our revolving credit facility or existing debt    arrangements on favorable terms or at all, which could    negatively affect our ability to fund current and future    operations as well as future acquisitions and development. If we    are unable to access financing at competitive rates, or if our    short-term or long-term borrowings costs dramatically increase,    our ability to finance our operations, meet our short-term debt    obligations and implement our operating strategy could be    adversely affected. We    recognized impairment charges for our goodwill and other    indefinite lived intangible assets.     In the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company recognized    $67.1 million and $11.8 million of impairment charges    on goodwill and trade names, respectively, within the FSTech    segment. The goodwill impairment charge is an estimate and may    be adjusted during the first quarter of 2011 upon completion of    a detailed second step impairment analysis. In accordance with    generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess    our goodwill and    6Table of Contents    other indefinite lived intangible assets to determine if they    are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends,    disruptions to our business, unexpected significant changes or    planned changes in the use of our assets and market    capitalization declines may result in additional future    impairments to goodwill and other long lived assets. Future    impairment charges could significantly affect our results of    operations in the periods recognized. Impairment charges would    also reduce our consolidated shareholders equity and    increase our    debt-to-total-capitalization    ratio, which may result in an event of default under our    revolving credit facility and other debt instruments. Upon an    event of default, if not waived by our lenders, our lenders may    declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable. See    Note 5  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for    further detail.   Our    ability to use net operating loss (NOL) carryovers    to reduce future tax payments could be negatively impacted if    there is a change in our ownership or a failure to generate    sufficient taxable income.     Presently, there is no annual limitation on our ability to use    U.S. federal NOLs to reduce future income taxes. However,    if an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the    Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, occurs with respect    to our capital stock, our ability to use NOLs would be limited    to specific annual amounts. Generally, an ownership change    occurs if certain persons or groups increase their aggregate    ownership by more than 50 percentage points of our total    capital stock in a three-year period. If an ownership change    occurs, our ability to use domestic NOLs to reduce taxable    income is generally limited to an annual amount based on the    fair market value of our stock immediately prior to the    ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt interest    rate. NOLs that exceed the Section 382 limitation in any    year continue to be allowed as carry forwards for the remainder    of the    20-year    carry forward period and can be used to offset taxable income    for years within the carryover period subject to the limitation    in each year. Our use of new NOLs arising after the date of an    ownership change would not be affected. If more than a 50%    ownership change were to occur, use of our NOLs to reduce    payments of federal taxable income may be deferred to later    years within the    20-year    carryover period; however, if the carryover period for any loss    year expires, the use of the remaining NOLs for the loss year    will be prohibited. If we should fail to generate a sufficient    level of taxable income prior to the expiration of the NOL carry    forward periods, then we will lose the ability to apply the NOLs    as offsets to future taxable income.   The    execution of our growth strategy is dependent upon the continued    availability of credit and third-party financing arrangements    for our customers.     Economic downturns result in tighter credit markets, which could    adversely affect our customers ability to secure the    financing or to secure the financing at favorable terms or    interest rates necessary to proceed or continue with purchases    of our products and services. Our customers or potential    customers inability to secure financing for projects could    result in the delay, cancellation or down-sizing of new    purchases or the suspension of purchases already under contract,    which could cause a decline in the demand for our products and    services and negatively impact our revenues and earnings.   Failure    to keep pace with technological developments may adversely    affect our operations.     We are engaged in an industry which will be affected by future    technological developments. The introduction of products or    processes utilizing new technologies could render our existing    products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. Our success will    depend upon our ability to develop and introduce on a timely and    cost-effective basis new products, applications and processes    that keep pace with technological developments and address    increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. We may not be    successful in identifying, developing and marketing new    products, applications and processes and product or process    enhancements. We may experience difficulties that could delay or    prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing    of product or process enhancements or new products, applications    or processes. Our products, applications or processes may not    adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve    market acceptance. Our business, operating results and financial    condition could be materially and adversely affected if we were    to incur delays in developing new products, applications or    processes or product or process enhancements, or if our products    do not gain market acceptance.    7Table of Contents  Our    efforts to develop new products and services or enhance existing    products and services involve substantial research, development    and marketing expenses, and the resulting new or enhanced    products or services may not generate sufficient revenues to    justify the expense.     We place a high priority on developing new products and    services, as well as enhancing our existing products and    services. As a result of these efforts, we may be required to    expend substantial research, development and marketing    resources, and the time and expense required to develop a new    product or service or enhance an existing product or service are    difficult to predict. We may not succeed in developing,    introducing or marketing new products or services or product or    service enhancements. In addition, we cannot be certain that any    new or enhanced product or service will generate sufficient    revenue to justify the expense and resources devoted to this    product diversification effort.   We    have international operations that are subject to foreign    economic and political uncertainties.     Our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and changing    international economic and political conditions that are beyond    our control. We expect a significant portion of our revenues and    profits to come from international sales for the foreseeable    future. Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to    a number of risks, including abrupt changes in foreign    government policies and regulations, restrictive domestic and    international trade regulations, U.S. laws applicable to    foreign operations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act    (FCPA), political, religious and economic    instability, local labor market conditions, the imposition of    foreign tariffs and other trade barriers and, in some cases,    international hostilities. To the extent that our international    operations are affected by unexpected and adverse foreign    economic and political conditions, we may experience project    disruptions and losses which could significantly reduce our    revenues and profits. Additionally, penalties for non-compliance    with laws applicable to international business and trade, such    as FCPA, could negatively impact our business.     Some of our contracts are denominated in foreign currencies,    which results in additional risk of fluctuating currency values    and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on    currency exchange. Changes in the value of foreign currencies    over the longer term could increase our U.S. dollar costs    for, or reduce our U.S. dollar revenues from, our foreign    operations. Any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result    of foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect our    profits.   We    operate in highly competitive markets.     The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Many of    our competitors have significantly greater financial resources    than the Company. The intensity of this competition, which is    expected to continue, can result in price discounting and margin    pressures throughout the industry and may adversely affect our    ability to increase or maintain prices for our products. In    addition, certain of our competitors may have lower overall    labor or material costs. In addition, our contracts with    municipal and other governmental customers are in some cases    awarded and renewed through competitive bidding. We may not be    successful in obtaining or renewing these contracts, which could    be harmful to our business and financial performance.   Our    ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to    attract and retain key personnel.     Our ability to operate our businesses and implement our    strategies depends in part on the efforts of our executive    officers and other key employees. In addition, our future    success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to    attract and retain qualified personnel, including finance    personnel, research professionals, technical sales professionals    and engineers. The loss of the services of any key employee or    the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could    have a material adverse effect on our business or business    prospects.   We    may incur material losses and costs as a result of product    liability, warranty, recall claims, client service interruption    or other lawsuits or claims that may be brought against    us.     We are exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the    normal course of business in the event that our products    actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected, or the use of    our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury    and/or    property damage. For example, we have been sued by firefighters    seeking damages claiming    8Table of Contents    that exposure to our sirens has impaired their hearing and that    the sirens are therefore defective. In addition, we are subject    to other claims and litigation from time to time as further    described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.    In addition, we could experience material liability or    contractual damage costs due to software or service interruption    in our FSTech business. We could experience material warranty or    product liability costs in the future and incur significant    costs to defend against these claims. We carry insurance and    maintain reserves for product liability claims. However, we    cannot assure that our insurance coverage will be adequate if    such claims do arise, and any liability not covered by insurance    could have a material adverse impact on our results of    operations and financial position. A future claim could involve    the imposition of punitive damages, the award of which, pursuant    to state laws, may not be covered by insurance. In addition,    warranty or other claims are not typically covered by insurance.    Any product liability or warranty issues may adversely impact    our reputation as a manufacturer of high quality, safe products    and may have a material adverse effect on our business.   We    may be unsuccessful in our future acquisitions, if any, which    may have an adverse effect on our business.     Our long-term strategy includes expanding into adjacent markets    through selective acquisitions of companies, complementary    technologies and organic growth in order to enhance our global    market position and broaden our product offerings. This strategy    may involve the acquisition of companies that, among other    things, enable us to build on our existing strength in a market    or that give us access to proprietary technologies that are    strategically valuable or allows us to leverage our distribution    channels. In connection with this strategy, we could face    certain risks and uncertainties in addition to those we face in    the    day-to-day    operations of our business. We also may be unable to identify    suitable targets for acquisition or make acquisitions at    favorable prices. If we identify a suitable acquisition    candidate, our ability to successfully implement the acquisition    would depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to    obtain financing on acceptable terms. In addition, our    acquisition activities could be disrupted by overtures from    competitors for the targeted companies, governmental regulation    and rapid developments in our industry that decrease the value    of a targets products or services.     Acquisitions involve risks, including those associated with the    following:            integrating the operations, financial reporting, disparate    technologies and personnel of acquired companies;            managing geographically dispersed operations;            diverting managements attention from other business    concerns;            entering markets or lines of business in which we have either    limited or no direct experience; and            potentially losing key employees, customers and strategic    partners of acquired companies.     We also may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits.    Acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may    negatively impact our results of operations as a result of,    among other things, the incurrence of debt, one time write-offs    of goodwill, and amortization expenses of other intangible    assets. In addition, future acquisitions could result in    dilutive issuances of equity securities.   We    have substantially increased our leverage in order to finance    acquisitions, and we are subject to restrictive covenants that    will affect our ability to engage in business    transactions.     We have incurred significant indebtedness for the financing of    acquisitions. Increased indebtedness may reduce our flexibility    to respond to changing business and economic conditions or fund    capital expenditures or working capital needs because we will    require additional funds to service our indebtedness. In    addition, financial and other covenants we have with our lenders    will limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make    investments, pay dividends and engage in other transactions, and    the leverage may cause potential lenders to be less willing to    loan funds to us in the future.    9Table of Contents  Businesses    acquired by us may have liabilities which are not known to    us.     We may assume liabilities in connection with the acquisition of    businesses. There may be liabilities that we fail or are unable    to discover in the course of performing due diligence    investigations on the acquired businesses. In these    circumstances, we cannot assure that our rights to    indemnification from sellers of the acquired businesses to us    will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset    the possible liabilities associated with the businesses or    property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the    aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business.   The    costs associated with complying with environmental and safety    regulations could lower our margins.     We, like other manufacturers, continue to face heavy    governmental regulation of our products, especially in the areas    of the environment and employee health and safety. Complying    with environmental and safety requirements has added and will    continue to add to the cost of our products, and could increase    the capital required. While we believe that we are in compliance    in all material respects with these laws and regulations, we may    be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with    respect to our operations under existing laws or those that may    be adopted. These requirements are complex, change frequently    and have tended to become more stringent over time. Therefore,    we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines    and civil or criminal sanctions as a result of violation of, or    liabilities under, environmental laws and safety regulations.   The    inability to obtain raw materials, component parts, and/or    finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner from    suppliers would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and    market our products.     We purchase raw materials and component parts from suppliers to    be used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we    purchase certain finished goods from suppliers. Changes in our    relationships with suppliers, shortages, production delays or    work stoppages by the employees of such suppliers could have a    material adverse effect on our ability to timely manufacture and    market products. In addition, increases in the costs of    purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods could    result in manufacturing interruptions, delays, inefficiencies or    our inability to market products. In addition, our profit    margins would decrease if prices of purchased raw materials,    component parts or finished goods increase and we are unable to    pass on those increases to our customers.   Disruptions    within our dealer network could adversely affect our    business.     We rely on a national and global dealer network to market    certain of our products and services. A disruption in our dealer    network within a specific local market could temporarily have an    adverse impact on our business within the affected market. In    addition, the loss or termination of a significant number of    dealers could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing    our products and have an adverse effect on our business,    operating results or financial condition.   Our    business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other    labor relations matters.     We are subject to risk of work stoppages and other labor    relations matters because a significant portion of our workforce    is unionized. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 28% of    our hourly workers are represented by labor unions and are    covered by collective bargaining agreements. Many of these    agreements include provisions that limit our ability to realize    cost savings. Any strikes, threats of strikes, or other    resistance in connection with the negotiation of new labor    agreements or otherwise could materially adversely affect our    business as well as impair our ability to implement further    measures to reduce structural costs and improve production    efficiencies. On February 23, 2011, the Companys    subsidiary, Vactor Manufacturing Inc., located in Streator,    Illinois, received notice that the International Brotherhood of    the Boilermakers filed a petition under the National Labor    Relations Act, seeking certification to represent approximately    300 hourly employees for the purpose of collective    bargaining. The election to determine whether a majority of the    employees identified wish to be represented by the union for the    purpose of collective bargaining normally occurs within    42 days of the filing of the petition, subject to    adjustment in certain events.    10Table of Contents  We    could incur restructuring and impairment charges as we continue    to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and    rationalize our manufacturing operations in an effort to    optimize the cost structure.     We continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our    business and rationalize our manufacturing operations in an    effort to optimize the cost structure which could include, among    other actions, additional rationalization of our manufacturing    operations. These actions could result in significant charges    which could adversely affect our financial condition and results    of operations. Future actions could result in restructuring and    related charges, including but not limited to impairments,    employee termination costs and charges for pension and other    post retirement contractual benefits and pension curtailments    that could be significant. We have substantial amounts of    long-lived assets, including goodwill and intangible assets,    which are subject to periodic impairment analysis and review.    Identifying and assessing whether impairment indicators exist,    or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred,    including market conditions, operating results, competition and    general economic conditions, requires significant judgment. Any    of the above future actions could result in charges that could    have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of    operations. "
13,FSS,FEDERAL SIGNAL CORP,2010-02-26,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors.     We may occasionally make forward-looking statements and    estimates such as forecasts and projections of our future    performance or statements of our plans and objectives. These    forward-looking statements may be contained in, among other    things, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,    including this Annual Report on    4Table of ContentsForm 10-K,    press releases made by us and in oral statements made by our    officers. Actual results could differ materially from those    contained in such forward-looking statements. Important factors    that could cause our actual results to differ from those    contained in such forward-looking statements include, among    other things, the risks described below. The    execution of our growth strategy is dependent upon the continued    availability of credit and    third-party    financing arrangements for our customers.     The recent economic downturn has resulted in tighter credit    markets, which could adversely affect our customers    ability to secure the financing necessary to proceed or continue    with purchases of our products and services. Our customers    or potential customers inability to secure financing for    projects could result in the delay, cancellation or down-sizing    of new purchases or the suspension of purchases already under    contract, which could cause a decline in the demand for our    products and services and negatively impact our revenues and    earnings. We rely    on access to financial markets to finance a portion of our    working capital requirements and support our liquidity needs.    Access to these markets may be adversely affected by factors    beyond our control, including turmoil in the financial services    industry, volatility in securities trading markets and general    economic downturns.     We draw upon our revolving credit facility and our operating    cash flow to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures,    strategic acquisitions, pension contributions, debt repayments,    share repurchases and dividends. Market disruptions such as    those recently experienced in the United States and abroad have    materially impacted liquidity in the credit and debt markets,    making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and in    certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain    types of financing. Continued uncertainty in the financial    markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional    financing or to refinance our existing credit facility or    existing debt arrangements on favorable terms or at all, which    could negatively affect our ability to fund current and future    operations as well as future acquisitions and development. These    disruptions may include turmoil in the financial services    industry, unprecedented volatility in the markets where our    outstanding securities trade, and general economic downturns in    the areas where we do business. If we are unable to access    monies at competitive rates, or if our short-term or long-term    borrowings costs dramatically increase, our ability to finance    our operations, meet our short-term obligations and implement    our operating strategy could be adversely affected. Our    financial results are subject to considerable    cyclicality.     Our ability to be profitable depends heavily on varying    conditions in the United States government and municipal markets    and the overall United States economy. The industrial markets in    which we compete are subject to considerable cyclicality, and    move in response to cycles in the overall business environment.    Many of our customers are municipal governmental agencies, and    as such, we are dependent on municipal government spending.    Spending by our municipal customers can be affected by local    political circumstances, budgetary constraints, and other    factors. The United States government and municipalities depend    heavily on tax revenues as a source of their spending and,    accordingly, there is a historical correlation, of a one or two    year lag between the overall strength of the United States    economy and our sales to the United States government and    municipalities. Therefore, downturns in the United States    economy are likely to result in decreases in demand for our    products. During previous economic downturns, we experienced    decreases in sales and profitability, and we expect our business    to remain subject to similar economic fluctuations in the future. The    inability to obtain raw materials, component parts, and/or    finished goods in a timely and    cost-effective    manner from suppliers would adversely affect our ability to    manufacture and market our products.     We purchase raw materials and component parts from suppliers to    be used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we    purchase certain finished goods from suppliers. Changes in our    relationships with suppliers or increases in the costs of    purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods could    result in manufacturing interruptions, delays, inefficiencies or    our inability to market products. In addition, our profit    margins would decrease if prices of purchased raw materials,    component parts or finished goods increase and we are unable to    pass on those increases to our customers.    5Table of ContentsWe    operate in highly competitive markets.     The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. The    intensity of this competition, which is expected to continue,    can result in price discounting and margin pressures throughout    the industry and adversely affects our ability to increase or    maintain prices for our products. In addition, certain of our    competitors may have lower overall labor or material costs. We have    international operations that are subject to foreign economic    and political uncertainties.     Our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and changing    international economic and political conditions which are beyond    our control. During 2009, approximately 44% of our sales were to    customers outside the United States; with approximately 31%    of sales being supplied from our overseas operations. We expect    a significant and increasing portion of our revenues and profits    to come from international sales for the foreseeable future.    Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a    number of risks, including abrupt changes in foreign government    policies and regulations and, in some cases, international    hostilities. To the extent that our international operations are    affected by unexpected and adverse foreign economic and    political conditions, we may experience project disruptions and    losses which could significantly reduce our revenues and profits.     Some of our contracts are denominated in foreign currencies,    which result in additional risk of fluctuating currency values    and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on    currency exchange. Although currency exposure is hedged in the    short term, over the longer term changes in the value of foreign    currencies could increase our U.S. dollar costs for, or    reduce our U.S. dollar revenues from, our foreign    operations. Any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result    of foreign currency fluctuations could affect our profits. Failure    to keep pace with technological developments may adversely    affect our operations.     We are engaged in an industry which will be affected by future    technological developments. The introduction of products or    processes utilizing new technologies could render our existing    products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. Our success will    depend upon our ability to develop and introduce on a timely and    cost-effective basis new products, processes and applications    that keep pace with technological developments and address    increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. We may not be    successful in identifying, developing and marketing new    products, applications and processes and product or process    enhancements. We may experience difficulties that could delay or    prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing    of product or process enhancements or new products, applications    or processes. Our products, applications or processes may not    adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve    market acceptance. Our business, operating results and financial    condition could be materially and adversely affected if we were    to incur delays in developing new products, applications or    processes or product or process enhancements or if our products    do not gain market acceptance. Our    ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to    attract and retain key personnel.     Our ability to operate our businesses and implement our    strategies depends, in part, on the efforts of our executive    officers and other key employees. In addition, our future    success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to    attract and retain qualified personnel, including finance    personnel, research professionals, technical sales professionals    and engineers. The loss of the services of any key employee or    the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could    have a material adverse effect on our business or business    prospects. We may    incur material losses and costs as a result of product    liability, warranty, recall claims or other lawsuits or claims    that may be brought against us.     We are exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the    normal course of business in the event that our products    actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of    our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury    and/or    property damage. Accordingly, we could experience material    warranty or product liability costs in the future and incur    significant costs to defend against these claims. We carry    insurance and maintain reserves for product liability claims.    However, we cannot be assured that our insurance coverage will    be adequate if such claims do arise, and any liability not    covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our    results    6Table of Contents    of operations and financial position. A future claim could    involve the imposition of punitive damages, the award of which,    pursuant to state laws, may not be covered by insurance. In    addition, warranty or other claims are not typically covered by    insurance coverage. Any product liability or warranty issues may    adversely impact our reputation as a manufacturer of high    quality, safe products and may have a material adverse effect on    our business. The costs    associated with complying with environmental and safety    regulations could lower our margins.     We, like other manufacturers, continue to face heavy    governmental regulation of our products, especially in the areas    of the environment and employee health and safety. Complying    with environmental and safety requirements has added and will    continue to add to the cost of our products, and could increase    the capital required. While we believe that we are in compliance    in all material respects with these laws and regulations, we may    be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with    respect to our operations under existing laws or those that may    be adopted. These requirements are complex, change frequently    and have tended to become more stringent over time. Therefore,    we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines    and civil or criminal sanctions as a result of violations, or    liabilities under, environmental laws and safety regulations. We may be    required to recognize impairment charges for our goodwill and    other indefinite lived intangible assets.     In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we    periodically assess our goodwill and other indefinite lived    intangible assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant    negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our    business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in    use of the assets and market capitalization declines may result    in impairments to goodwill and other long lived assets. Future    impairment charges could significantly affect our results of    operations in the periods recognized. Impairment charges would    also reduce our consolidated shareholders equity and    increase our    debt-to-total-capitalization    ratio, which may result in an event of default on our credit    facility and other debt facilities. Upon an event of default, if    not waived by our lenders, our lenders may declare all amounts    outstanding as due and payable. We are    subject to a number of restrictive debt covenants.     Our credit facility and other debt instruments contain certain    restrictive debt covenants and other customary events of default    that may hinder our ability to continue operating or to take    advantage of attractive business opportunities. These    restrictive covenants include, among other things, an interest    coverage ratio of 3.00:1 in all quarters and a maximum    debt-to-total-capitalization    ratio of 0.5:1.0. Our ability to comply with these restrictive    covenants may be affected by the other factors described in this    Risk Factors
 section and other factors outside our    control. Failure to comply with one or more of these restrictive    covenants may result in an event of default. Upon an event of    default, if not waived by our lenders, our lenders may declare    all amounts outstanding as due and payable. If we are unable to    comply with the restrictive covenants in the future, we would be    required to obtain further modifications from our lenders or    secure another source of financing. If our current lenders    accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness, we may not have    sufficient capital available at that time to pay the amounts due    to our lenders on a timely basis. In addition, these restrictive    covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that    benefit us, including responding to changing business and    economic conditions and taking advantage of attractive business    opportunities. Our    strategy to pursue growth through selective acquisitions may not    be successful.     Our long-term strategy includes expanding into adjacent markets    through selective acquisitions of companies, complementary    technologies and organic growth. This strategy may involve the    acquisition of companies that enable us to build on our existing    strength in a market or that give us access to proprietary    technologies that are strategically valuable or allows us to    leverage our distribution channels. In connection with this    strategy, we could face certain risks and uncertainties in    addition to those we face in the    day-to-day    operations of our business. The acquisitions that we may    consider may not be successfully consummated. Our acquisition    activities can be disrupted by overtures from competitors for    the targeted candidates, governmental regulation and rapid    developments in our industry. We may face additional risks and    uncertainties following an acquisition including: (i) the    difficulty in integrating the newly-acquired business and    operations in an efficient and effective manner; (ii) the    7Table of Contents    inability to achieve strategic objectives, cost savings,    expected levels of profitability and other benefits from the    acquisition; (iii) the lack of success by the acquired    business in its markets; (iv) the loss of key employees of    the acquired business; (v) the diversion of the attention    of senior management from our operations; and (vi) the    liabilities that were not known at the time of the acquisition    or the need to address tax or accounting issues. If we fail to    timely recognize or address these matters or to devote adequate    resources to them, we may fail to achieve our growth strategy or    otherwise realize the intended benefits of the acquisition. Even    if we are unable to integrate our business operations    successfully, the integration may not result in the realization    of the full benefits of synergies, cost savings, profitability,    innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible    from the integration or that the benefits will be achieved    within the forcasted period of time. In addition, our    acquisition activities could require us to secure additional    debt or equity financing, which we may not be able to secure on    favorable terms or at all. Our    efforts to develop new products and services or enhance existing    products and services involve substantial research, development    and marketing expenses, and the resulting new or enhanced    products or services may not generate sufficient revenues to    justify the expense.     We place a high priority on developing new products and    services, as well as enhancing our existing products and    services. As a result of these efforts, we may be required to    expend substantial research, development and marketing    resources, and the time and expense required to develop a new    product or service or enhance an existing product or service are    difficult to predict. We may not succeed in developing,    introducing or marketing new products or services or product or    service enhancements. In addition, we cannot be certain that any    new or enhanced product or service will generate sufficient    revenue to justify the expense and resources devoted to this    product diversification effort. "

Our ability to comply with    these restrictive covenants may be affected by the other factors    described in this Risk Factors
 section and other    factors outside our control. Failure to comply with one or more    of these restrictive covenants may result in an event of    default. Upon an event of default, if not waived by our lenders,    our lenders may declare all amounts outstanding as due and    payable. If we are unable to comply with the restrictive    covenants in the future, we would be required to obtain further    modifications from our lenders or secure another source of    financing. If our current lenders accelerate the maturity of our    indebtedness, we may not have sufficient capital available at    that time to pay the amounts due to our lenders on a timely    basis. In addition, these restrictive covenants may prevent us    from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including    responding to changing business and economic conditions and    taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. "
11,FSS,FEDERAL SIGNAL CORP,2008-02-27,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors.     The following are some of the risks that we face in our    business. The list of risk factors is not exhaustive. There can    be no assurance that we have correctly identified and    appropriately assessed all factors affecting our business or    that publicly available and other information with respect to    these matters is complete and correct. Additional risks not    presently known to us or that we currently believe to be    immaterial also may adversely impact us. Should any risks and    uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments    could have material adverse effects on our business, financial    condition and results of operations. Our    financial results are subject to considerable    cyclicality.     Our ability to be profitable depends heavily on varying    conditions in the United States government and municipal markets    and the overall United States economy. The industrial markets in    which we compete are subject to considerable cyclicality, and    move in response to cycles in the overall business environment.    Many of our customers are municipal governmental agencies, and    as such, we are dependent on municipal government spending.    Spending by our municipal customers can be affected by local    political circumstances, budgetary constraints, and other    factors. The United States government and municipalities depend    heavily on tax revenues as a source of their spending and,    accordingly, there is a historical correlation, of a one or two    year lag between the overall strength of the United States    economy and our sales to the United States government and    municipalities. Therefore, downturns in the United States    economy are likely to result in decreases in demand for our    products. During previous economic downturns, we experienced    decreases in sales and profitability, and we expect our business    to remain subject to similar economic fluctuations in the future. The    inability to obtain raw materials, component parts, and/or    finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner from    suppliers would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and    market our products.     We purchase raw materials and component parts from suppliers to    be used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we    purchase certain finished goods from suppliers. Changes in our    relationships with suppliers or increases in the costs of    purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods could    result in manufacturing interruptions, delays, inefficiencies or    our inability to market products. In addition, our profit    margins would decrease if prices of purchased raw materials,    component parts or finished goods increase and we are unable to    pass on those increases to our customers.    5Table of ContentsWe    operate in highly competitive markets.     The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. The    intensity of this competition, which is expected to continue,    can result in price discounting and margin pressures throughout    the industry and adversely affects our ability to increase or    maintain prices for our products. In addition, certain of our    competitors may have lower overall labor or material costs. Failure    to keep pace with technological developments may adversely    affect our operations.     We are engaged in an industry which will be affected by future    technological developments. The introduction of products or    processes utilizing new technologies could render our existing    products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. Our success will    depend upon our ability to develop and introduce on a timely and    cost-effective basis new products, processes and applications    that keep pace with technological developments and address    increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. We may not be    successful in identifying, developing and marketing new    products, applications and processes and product or process    enhancements. We may experience difficulties that could delay or    prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing    of product or process enhancements or new products, applications    or processes. Our products, applications or processes may not    adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve    market acceptance. Our business, operating results and financial    condition could be materially and adversely affected if we were    to incur delays in developing new products, applications or    processes or product or process enhancements or if our products    do not gain market acceptance. Our ability to operate our Company effectively could be    impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.     Our ability to operate our businesses and implement our    strategies depends, in part, on the efforts of our executive    officers and other key employees. In addition, our future    success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to    attract and retain qualified personnel, including finance    personnel, research professionals, technical sales professionals    and engineers. The loss of the services of any key employee or    the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could    have a material adverse effect on our business or business    prospects. We have    international operations that are subject to foreign economic    and political uncertainties.     Our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and changing    international economic and political conditions which are beyond    our control. During 2007, approximately 37% of our sales were to    customers outside the United States; with approximately 24% of    sales being supplied from our overseas operations. We expect a    significant and increasing portion of our revenues and profits    to come from international sales for the foreseeable future.    Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a    number of risks, including abrupt changes in foreign government    policies and regulations and, in some cases, international    hostilities. To the extent that our international operations are    affected by unexpected and adverse foreign economic and    political conditions, we may experience project disruptions and    losses which could significantly reduce our revenues and profits.     Some of our contracts are denominated in foreign currencies,    which result in additional risk of fluctuating currency values    and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on    currency exchange. Although currency exposure is hedged in the    short term, over the longer term changes in the value of foreign    currencies could increase our US dollar costs for, or reduce our    US dollar revenues from, our foreign operations. Any increased    costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreign currency    fluctuations could affect our profits. We may    incur material losses and costs as a result of product    liability, warranty, recall claims or other lawsuits or claims    that may be brought against us.     We are exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the    normal course of business in the event that our products    actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of    our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury    and/or    property damage. Accordingly, we could experience material    warranty or product liability costs in the future and incur    significant costs to defend against these claims. We carry    insurance and maintain reserves for product liability claims.    However, we cannot be assured that our insurance coverage will    be adequate if    6Table of Contents    such claims do arise, and any liability not covered by insurance    could have a material adverse impact on our results of    operations and financial position. A future claim could involve    the imposition of punitive damages, the award of which, pursuant    to state laws, may not be covered by insurance. In addition,    warranty or other claims are not typically covered by insurance    coverage. Any product liability or warranty issues may adversely    impact our reputation as a manufacturer of high quality, safe    products and may have a material adverse effect on our business. The costs    associated with complying with environmental and safety    regulations could lower our margins.     We, like other manufacturers, continue to face heavy    governmental regulation of our products, especially in the areas    of the environment and employee health and safety. Complying    with environmental and safety requirements has added and will    continue to add to the cost of our products, and could increase    the capital required. While we believe that we are in compliance    in all material respects with these laws and regulations, we may    be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with    respect to our operations under existing laws or those that may    be adopted. These requirements are complex, change frequently    and have tended to become more stringent over time. Therefore,    we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines    and civil or criminal sanctions as a result of violations, or    liabilities under, environmental laws and safety regulations. We are    subject to a number of restrictive debt covenants.     Our credit facility and other debt instruments contain certain    restrictive debt covenants that may hinder our ability to take    advantage of attractive business opportunities. Our ability to    meet these covenants may be affected by factors outside our    control. Failure to meet one or more of these covenants may    result in an event of default. Upon an event of default, some of    our lenders may be entitled to declare all amounts outstanding    as due and payable. "
