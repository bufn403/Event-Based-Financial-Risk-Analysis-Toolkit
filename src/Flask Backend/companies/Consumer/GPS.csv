7,GPS,GAP INC,2024-03-19,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.Our past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance because actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties discussed below and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K. In addition, historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In such case, the market price of our common stock could decline.Risks Related to Macroeconomic ConditionsGlobal economic conditions have and could continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our business is affected by global economic conditions and the related impact on consumer spending worldwide. Global economic conditions have and could continue to impact our business and other businesses around the world. Some of the factors that may influence consumer spending patterns include higher unemployment levels, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or the resurgence of the pandemic or the emergence of new strains or variants), extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, higher consumer debt levels, inflationary pressures, recession or fear of recession, global geopolitical instability (including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts), reductions in net worth based on market declines and uncertainty, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, fluctuating interest and foreign currency rates and credit availability, government austerity measures, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Historically, consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower or during other periods of economic instability or uncertainty.Deteriorating economic conditions or geopolitical instability in any of the regions in which we and our franchisees sell our products could reduce consumer confidence and adversely impact consumer spending patterns, and thereby could adversely affect our sales and results of operations, and result in changes to the assumptions and estimates used when preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. Examples include, but are not limited to, assumptions and estimates used for inventory valuation, income taxes and valuation allowances, sales return and bad debt allowances, deferred revenue, and the impairment of long-lived assets. In challenging and uncertain economic environments, we cannot predict whether or when such circumstances may improve or worsen, or what impact, if any, such circumstances could have on our business, financial condition and results of operations, or on the price of our common stock.Risks Related to Competition, Brand Relevance and Brand ExecutionOur business is highly competitive.The global apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We and our franchisees compete with local, national, and global department stores, mass-market retailers, specialty and discount store chains, independent retail stores, and online businesses that market similar lines of merchandise. We face a variety of competitive challenges in an increasingly complex and fast-paced environment, including:•anticipating and quickly responding to changing apparel trends and customer demands;•attracting customer traffic both in stores and online;•competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value;•maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to customers in diverse market segments and geographic locations;9•anticipating and responding to changing customer shopping preferences and practices, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement, social media communication, and online shopping;•developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to customers of varying demographics and tastes;•purchasing and stocking merchandise to match seasonal weather patterns, and our ability to react to shifts in weather that impact consumer demand;•sourcing and allocating merchandise efficiently; and•improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our processes in order to deliver cost savings to fund growth.If we or our franchisees are not able to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in retail markets or customer expectations in the United States or internationally, our results of operations would be adversely affected.We must successfully gauge apparel trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed.Our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our design and purchasing decisions may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing apparel trends or consumer acceptance of our products. Transportation shortages, factory closures, labor shortages, port congestion and other supply chain disruptions have in the past and may in the future lead to prolonged delays in receiving inventory. The global apparel retail business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences, dictated in part by apparel trends and season. To the extent we misjudge the market for our merchandise or the products suitable for local markets, or fail to execute trends and deliver products to the market as timely as our competitors, our sales will be adversely affected, and the markdowns required to move the resulting excess inventory will adversely affect our margins and results of operations.We must maintain our reputation and brand image.Our brands have wide recognition, and the success of our business depends in large part on our ability to maintain, enhance and protect our brand image and reputation and our customers’ connection to our brands. We must also adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. Even if we react appropriately to negative posts or comments about us or our brands on social media and online, our customers’ perception of our brand image and our reputation could be negatively impacted. Customer sentiment could also be shaped by our partnerships with artists, athletes and other public figures, as well as our sustainability policies and related sourcing and operations decisions. Failure to maintain, enhance and protect our brand image could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Risks Related to Our Business OperationsIf we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected.Fluctuations in the global apparel retail markets impact the levels of inventory maintained by apparel retailers. The nature of the global apparel retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to the peak holiday selling season when we build up our inventory levels. Merchandise usually must be ordered well in advance of the applicable selling season and frequently before apparel trends are confirmed by customer purchases. Transportation shortages, factory closures, labor shortages, port congestion and other supply chain disruptions may lead to prolonged delays in receiving inventory. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. We have not always predicted our customers’ preferences and acceptance levels of our trend items with accuracy. If sales do not meet expectations, including due to the impact of current macroeconomic conditions on consumer demand, too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower-than-planned gross margins. We could also be 10required to take significant impairment charges on delayed or unproductive inventory, which we experienced in 2022. Conversely, if we underestimate or are unable to satisfy consumer demand for our products, we may experience inventory shortages, which could result in lower than anticipated sales, delayed shipments to customers and negative impacts on consumer relationships and brand loyalty. Any of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations. We have strategic initiatives designed to optimize our inventory levels and increase the efficiency and responsiveness of our supply chain, including vendor fabric platforming, product testing, and in-season response to demand. We are also developing additional capabilities to analyze customer behavior and demand, which we believe will allow us to better localize assortment and improve store-level allocations to further tailor our assortments to customer needs and increase sell-through. These capabilities involve changes to our inventory management systems and processes. If we are unable to implement these initiatives and integrate these additional capabilities successfully, we may not realize the return on our investments that we anticipate, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.Failure to protect our inventory from loss and theft may adversely affect our results of operations.Risk of loss or theft of assets, including inventory shortage, is inherent in the retail business. Loss may be caused by error or misconduct of employees, customers, vendors or other third parties including through organized retail crime and professional theft, which may be further impacted by macroeconomic factors, including the enforcement environment. Our inability to effectively prevent or minimize the loss or theft of assets, or to effectively reduce, or to accurately predict and accrue for the impact of those losses, could adversely affect our results of operations.Our failure to manage key executive succession and retention and to continue to attract qualified personnel could adversely affect our results of operations.The loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor to a key role could adversely affect our business. We made significant changes to our executive leadership team in recent years, including hiring a new President and Chief Executive Officer in 2023. The failure to successfully transition and assimilate key employees, including our new CEO, the effectiveness of our leaders, and any further transitions could adversely affect our results of operations.Our business and future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel in our design, merchandising, sourcing, marketing, and other functions. In addition, executing strategic initiatives may require us to hire and develop employees with appropriate and specialized experience. We must also attract, develop, and retain a sufficient number of qualified field and distribution center personnel. Competition for talent is intense and the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high. Furthermore, we have experienced a shortage of labor for field and distribution center positions, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel for these and other positions in future periods. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates and competitive wage pressures, minimum wage legislation, and overtime and paid leave regulations. In addition, there has been an increase in workers exercising their right to form or join a union, both generally and in the retail industry, and the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has issued decisions making it easier for employees to organize. Although none of our U.S. and Canadian employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements, we have experienced union organizing activity from time to time, and there can be no assurance that our employees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future. If a significant portion of our work force were to become unionized, our culture and operating model could change and our labor costs could increase. Our responses to any union organizing efforts could also impact how our Company and brands are perceived by customers and employees.Traditional geographic competition for talent has changed as a result of the shift to remote work. If our employment proposition is not perceived as favorable compared to other companies, including due to our requirements or expectations about when or how often certain employees work on-site or remotely, it could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain our employees. 11If we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate talented employees with the appropriate skill sets, or if changes to our organizational structure or business model adversely affect morale or retention, we may not achieve our objectives and our business could be adversely affected.Our business is subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing.Independent third parties manufacture all of our products for us. As a result, we are directly impacted by increases in the cost of those products.If we experience significant increases in demand or need to replace an existing vendor, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or that any vendor would allocate sufficient capacity to us to meet our requirements. In addition, for any new manufacturing source, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our vendors in our methods and products, as well as our quality control, environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. Moreover, in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Any delays, interruptions, or increased costs in the manufacture of our products could impact our ability to source product and result in lower than anticipated sales. A large portion of our global sourcing comes from a few specific countries. For example, in fiscal 2023, approximately 29 percent and 18 percent of our merchandise, by dollar value, was purchased from factories in Vietnam and Indonesia, respectively. Delays in production and added costs in these countries have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our results of operations.Because independent vendors manufacture virtually all of our products outside of our principal sales markets, third parties must transport our products over large geographic distances. Increases in transportation costs or delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, port and infrastructure congestion, public health crises, social unrest, changes in local economic conditions, political upheavals, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with transitioning between vendors, could adversely affect our results of operations. Attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea, catalyzed by the Israel-Hamas conflict, have disrupted Red Sea shipping lanes and may continue to disrupt global trade flows and impact shipping capacity. Operating or manufacturing delays, transportation delays, or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as air freight, which have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, the cost of fuel is a significant component of transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products (including due to inflationary pressures, geopolitical instability, or regulation of energy inputs and greenhouse gas emissions) could adversely affect our gross margins.If our vendors, or any raw material suppliers on which our vendors rely, suffer prolonged manufacturing or transportation disruptions due to pandemics and public health crises, extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, geopolitical instability, or other unforeseen events, our ability to source product could be adversely impacted which would adversely affect our sales and results of operations.Risks associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries, including failure of our vendors to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct, could harm our business.We purchase merchandise from third-party vendors in many different countries, and we require those vendors to adhere to a Code of Vendor Conduct, which includes anti-corruption, environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. From time to time, our vendors and their suppliers may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable local laws. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more vendors, suppliers or other third parties could subject us to liability, and could adversely affect our reputation, business and results of operations.12Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain.Our operations are subject to complex trade and customs laws, regulations and tax requirements. The countries in which our products are manufactured or imported, or may be manufactured or imported in the future, may from time to time impose duties, tariffs, or other restrictions on our imports or adversely change existing restrictions.  For example, the United States has imposed tariffs and bans on goods imported from China (such as the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act). The current political landscape, including with respect to United States-China relations, has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to future tax and trade policy. We are unable to determine the impact that changes in tax and trade policy could have on our global sourcing operations. Our sourcing operations could also be adversely affected by geopolitical and financial instability in our sourcing countries, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, resulting in the disruption of trade from our sourcing countries, significant fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, restrictions on the transfer of funds, or other trade disruptions. Changes in tax and trade policy, such as the imposition of new duties or tariffs on imported products, or disruptions to our sourcing operations in our sourcing countries, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us and adversely affect our business and results of operations.The global market for real estate is competitive.Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices nationally and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics, and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases. In addition, we may seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition, relocate, or close some of our real estate locations, which in most cases requires a modification or termination of an existing store lease. Beginning in fiscal 2020 through the end of fiscal 2023, we closed, net of openings, 344 Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America. Failure to secure adequate new locations, successfully modify or exit existing locations, or effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, could adversely affect our results of operations.Additionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties within the United States and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to enter into leases, exercise lease options or renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.Risks Related to Strategic Transactions and InvestmentsWe have and may continue to engage in or seek to engage in strategic transactions, such as acquisitions, partnerships, divestitures and other dispositions, that are subject to various risks and uncertainties and which could disrupt or adversely affect our business.We have and may continue to engage in or seek to engage in strategic transactions, such as acquisitions, partnerships, divestitures or other dispositions. In recent years, we transferred our European, Mexico and China businesses to a partnership model, and are awaiting regulatory approvals to transfer our Taiwan business. We also divested our Janie and Jack and Intermix brands and acquired two technology companies. We may not be able to complete strategic transactions on anticipated terms or time frames or at all, and such transactions may not generate some or all of the expected strategic, financial, operational or other benefits if and when completed on such anticipated time frames or at all. In addition, these transactions may be complex in nature, and unanticipated developments or changes, including changes in law, the macroeconomic environment, market conditions, the retail industry or political conditions may affect our ability to complete such transactions. In addition, the process of completing these transactions may be time-consuming and involve considerable costs and expenses, which may be significantly higher than what we anticipate and may not yield a benefit if the transactions are not completed successfully. Executing these transactions may require significant time and attention from our senior management and employees, which could disrupt our ongoing business and adversely 13affect our results of operations. We may also experience increased difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating employees and/or attracting and retaining customers during the pendency or following the completion of any of these transactions, which could harm our business.Changes in our business strategy or restructuring our operations may not generate the intended benefits or projected cost savings we anticipate.We have and may continue to adjust our business strategies or restructure our operations to meet changes in our business environment. In 2022, we began taking steps to drive long-term improvements across our business, which included reducing open and existing corporate roles, renegotiating our advertising agency contracts, reducing technology operating costs, and rationalizing digital investments. In March 2023, we shared plans to further simplify and optimize our operating model and structure, including actions such as increasing spans of control and decreasing management layers to improve quality and speed of decision making, as well as creating a consistent organizational structure across our brands. In connection with those actions, in April 2023, we announced a restructuring plan that included a reduction of the Company’s workforce primarily in headquarters locations. As of the first half of fiscal 2023, the reduction of the Company’s workforce under the restructuring plan was substantially completed.Our ability to achieve the intended benefits and projected cost savings from these actions are subject to many estimates and assumptions. For example, savings associated with these actions could be lower than anticipated. These actions are also subject to execution risk and may not generate the intended benefits and projected cost savings to the extent or on the timeline as expected, and our new organizational structure and strategies could be less successful than our previous organizational structure and strategies. Our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful.Our current business strategies include pursuing selective international expansion in a number of countries around the world through a number of channels. This includes our franchisees opening additional stores internationally. We have limited experience operating or franchising in some of these locations. In many of these locations, we face major established competitors. In addition, in many of these locations, the real estate, employment and labor, transportation and logistics, and other operating requirements differ dramatically from those in the places where we have more experience. Consumer tastes and trends may differ in these locations and, as a result, the sales of our products may not be successful or result in the margins we anticipate. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our results of operations could be adversely affected.Our franchise and licensing businesses are subject to certain risks not directly within our control that could impair the value of our brands.We have entered into franchise agreements to operate stores and websites in many countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores and websites that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. We have also entered into licensing agreements to sell products using our brand names. The effect of these arrangements on our business and results of operations is uncertain and will depend upon various factors, including the demand for our products in international markets, the demand for new product categories and our ability to successfully identify appropriate third parties to act as franchisees, licensees, distributors, or in a similar capacity. In addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as franchisee and licensee financial stability and the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store locations, store openings, and sales. Additionally, certain of our franchisees have in the past and may in the future be unable to make payments to landlords, distributors and suppliers, as well as payments to service any debt they may have outstanding, including to us. We have also provided loan guarantees to various lenders on behalf of certain franchisees, and have guaranteed or are contingently liable for certain franchisees' leases. These arrangements could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations.14Other risks that may affect these third parties include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, foreign exchange rates, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and geopolitical instability. The value of our brands could be impaired to the extent that these third parties do not operate their stores or websites or sell our branded products in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee or licensee, could also adversely affect our results of operations and our reputation.Our investments in customer, digital, and omni-channel shopping initiatives may not deliver the results we anticipate.One of our strategic priorities is to further develop an omni-channel shopping experience for our customers through the integration of our store and digital shopping channels. Our omni-channel initiatives include cross-channel logistics optimization and exploring additional ways to develop an omni-channel shopping experience, including further digital integration and customer personalization. These initiatives involve significant investments in information technology (""IT"") systems, data science and artificial intelligence initiatives, and significant operational changes. Our competitors are also investing in omni-channel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives. If the implementation of our customer, digital, and omni-channel initiatives is not successful, or we do not realize the return on our investments in these initiatives that we anticipate, our results of operations would be adversely affected.Risks Related to Data Privacy and CybersecurityWe are subject to data and security risks, which could adversely affect our operations and consumer confidence in our security measures or result in liability.As part of our normal operations, we receive and maintain confidential, proprietary, and personally identifiable information, including credit card information, and information about our customers, our employees, job applicants, and other third parties. The secure operation of our networks and systems, and those of our business partners, suppliers and third-party service providers, including those on which this type of information is stored, processed and maintained is critical to our business operations. These networks and systems are subject to an increasing threat of continually evolving data and security risks, which we must manage.Security breaches and vulnerabilities impacting our systems and those of our business partners and third-party service providers could cause harm to our systems or compromise data stored on our networks or those of our business partners and third-party service providers, and could expose us to remedial, legal and other costs which could be material. The retail industry, in particular, has been the target of recent cyberattacks. Our efforts to take appropriate measures to safeguard our information security and privacy environment from security breaches and vulnerabilities, and to train our employees to identify security threats as part of our security efforts, vary in maturity across our business. The constantly changing nature of the cyber threats landscape means that we are not able to anticipate or prevent all types of cyberattacks, and our logging processes may not be sufficient to fully investigate a cyberattack. Additionally, as cybercriminals become more sophisticated, the cost of proactive defensive measures continues to increase. Like our peers, we have been targeted by cyberattacks, which in some cases have been successful. Actual or anticipated cyberattacks and vulnerabilities may disrupt or impair our operations, and may cause us to incur costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in technological capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transactions and other data being more easily breached or compromised. Measures we implement to protect against cyberattacks and address vulnerabilities may also have the potential to impact our customers’ shopping experience or decrease activity on our websites by making them more difficult to use. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. 15The global regulatory environment surrounding data privacy and cybersecurity is increasingly demanding, and we are required to comply with new and constantly evolving laws, such as various state-level privacy laws in the United States and international laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union and United Kingdom, which give consumers the right to control how their personal information is collected, used, shared and retained. Our failure to comply with these and other data privacy laws or to secure personal or confidential information could result in significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of consumer confidence in our security measures, which could adversely affect our results of operations and our reputation.Failures of, or updates or changes to, our IT systems may disrupt operations.We maintain a complex technology platform consisting of both legacy and modern systems, and we also increasingly rely on third-party service providers for public cloud infrastructure that powers our e-commerce platform and other systems. Our owned and operated systems require continual maintenance, upgrades and changes, some of which are significant. Upgrades may involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of the inherent risks associated with maintaining and replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and addressing system disruptions. We may not successfully maintain or launch these systems as planned or implement them without disruptions to our operations. IT system disruptions or failures, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, or failure to successfully implement new or upgraded systems, could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations. As we continue to move to their platforms, our reliance on third-party systems means that any downtime or security issues they experience poses a greater risk of a single point of failure. Any failure by our third-party service providers could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations.Financial RisksReductions in income and cash flow from our credit card arrangement related to our private label and co-branded credit cards could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.A third party, Barclays Bank Delaware (""Barclays""), currently issues and services our portfolios of private label credit card and co-branded credit card programs for our Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta brands. Our agreement with Barclays provides for certain payments to be made by Barclays to us, including a share of revenues from the performance of the credit card portfolios. The income and cash flow that we receive from Barclays is dependent upon a number of factors, including the level of sales on private label and co-branded accounts, the level of balances carried on the accounts, payment rates on the accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on the accounts, the level of credit losses for the accounts, Barclay’s ability to extend credit to our customers, as well as the cost of customer rewards programs. All of these factors can vary based on changes in federal and state credit card, banking, and consumer protection laws. For example, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) recently capped credit card fees for late payments. The factors affecting the income and cash flow that we receive from our credit card arrangement can also vary based on a variety of economic, legal, social, and other factors that we cannot control. If the income and cash flow that we receive from our credit card arrangement decreases significantly, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.Our business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and our hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks.We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, operating expenses, profits, assets, and liabilities generated or incurred in foreign currencies as well as inventory purchases in U.S. dollars for our foreign subsidiaries. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact consumer spending or adversely affect the profitability of our foreign operations or those of our franchisees and licensees. Global economic and geopolitical uncertainty, such as the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas, have in the past and may in the future result in volatility in foreign exchange rates. Financial instruments that we use to hedge certain foreign currency risks may not succeed in fully offsetting the negative impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally only delay the impact of adverse foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations.16We experience fluctuations in our comparable sales and margins, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, our credit ratings and our liquidity.Our success depends in part on our ability to grow sales and improve margins. A variety of factors affect comparable sales and margins, including but not limited to apparel trends, competition, current economic conditions (including due to macroeconomic pressures and geopolitical instability), the timing of new merchandise releases and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of our marketing programs (including our loyalty program), supply chain disruptions and transitory costs, foreign currency fluctuations, industry traffic trends, and weather conditions. These factors may cause our comparable sales results and margins to differ materially from prior periods and from financial market expectations. Our comparable sales, including the associated comparable online sales, have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual and quarterly basis. Over the past five fiscal years, our reported annual comparable sales have ranged from a high of 6 percent in fiscal 2021 to a low of of negative 7 percent in fiscal 2022. As a result of the extensive temporary store closures during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, comparable sales are not a meaningful metric for fiscal 2020 and are excluded from this range. Over the past five fiscal years, our reported gross margins have ranged from a high of 39.8 percent in fiscal 2021 to a low of 34.1 percent in fiscal 2020. In addition, over the past five fiscal years, our reported operating margins have ranged from a high of 4.9 percent in fiscal 2021 to a low of negative 6.2 percent in fiscal 2020.Our ability to deliver strong comparable sales results and margins depends in large part on accurately forecasting demand and apparel trends, selecting effective marketing techniques, providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base, managing inventory effectively, using effective pricing strategies, and optimizing store performance. Fluctuations in our comparable sales and margins or failure to meet financial market expectations in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of our common stock, cause our credit ratings to decline, and negatively impact our liquidity.Our level of indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to operate and expand our business.We have a secured asset-based revolving credit agreement (the ""ABL Facility"") which has a borrowing capacity of $2.2 billion. We have also issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2029 and 2031 (the “Senior Notes”), which remain outstanding. As a result, we are subject to risks relating to our indebtedness.As of February 3, 2024, the aggregate principal amount of our total outstanding indebtedness was $1.5 billion under the Senior Notes. As of February 3, 2024, we had $2.2 billion in principal amount of undrawn commitments available for additional borrowings under the ABL Facility, subject to borrowing base availability.Our level of indebtedness could impact our business in the following ways:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations, including with respect to the Senior Notes and ABL Facility;•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and external conditions;•impair our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes;•require us to dedicate a material portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;•expose us to the risk of increased interest rates for borrowings under the ABL Facility, which bear interest at a variable rate;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;•place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; and17•limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions.Any of these risks could impact our ability to operate and expand our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we may in the future incur additional indebtedness, which could intensify these risks and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and fund our working capital and capital expenditures, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.We may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest under our indebtedness. For example, in 2023 we repaid our $350 million outstanding borrowing under the ABL Facility. We generated net cash from operating activities of $1,532 million in fiscal 2023 and ended fiscal 2023 with $1,873 million of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet.Our ability to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness depends upon our future operating performance and on our ability to generate cash flows in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our debt service obligations and other liquidity needs.If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investment and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity financing or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures (including due to restrictions in our indebtedness agreements), if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.If we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, we will be in default and, as a result, our lenders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, could terminate their commitments to loan money to us and could foreclose against any assets securing our indebtedness under the ABL Facility, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.Covenants in the ABL Facility may restrict our business and could limit our ability to implement our business plan.The ABL Facility includes covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to do the following under certain circumstances:•grant or incur liens;•sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;•make investments in certain subsidiaries;•pay dividends, make distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock; and•consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to another entity.Compliance with these and the other covenants in the ABL Facility may restrict our ability to implement our business plan, finance future operations, respond to changing business and economic conditions, secure additional financing, and engage in strategic transactions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with our financial or other covenants under the ABL Facility or that any covenant violations would be waived in the future. Any violation that is not waived could result in an event of default and, as a result, our lenders under the ABL Facility could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, could suspend commitments to make any advances or could require any outstanding letters of credit to be collateralized by an interest bearing cash account, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.18Changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the capital markets and adversely impact our business and financial condition.We currently have corporate credit ratings of BB with a negative outlook from Standard & Poor's and Ba3 with a negative outlook from Moody’s. Any reduction in our credit ratings could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets, more restrictive covenants in future financing documents and higher interest costs, and potentially increased lease or hedging costs. In addition, market conditions such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing or refinance existing debt on terms that would be acceptable to us.Risks Related to Sustainability and Climate ChangeOur business is subject to evolving regulations and expectations with respect to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters that could expose us to numerous risks.Increasingly regulators, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are focusing on ESG matters and related disclosures. These developments have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting ESG-related requirements and expectations. For example, developing and acting on ESG-related initiatives, including design, sourcing and operations decisions, and collecting, measuring and reporting ESG-related information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards, including the SEC’s recently approved climate-related reporting requirements and sustainability reporting requirements in the European Union. We may also communicate certain ESG-related initiatives and goals in our SEC filings or in other public disclosures. These ESG-related initiatives and goals could be difficult and expensive to implement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and may not advance at a sufficient pace, and we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of our disclosures. Further, statements about our ESG-related initiatives and goals, and progress against those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope or nature of such initiatives or goals, or for any revisions to these goals. If our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to our ESG-related goals on a timely basis, or at all, our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Climate change may have an adverse impact on our business.There are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Our properties and operations, and those of our franchisees, vendors and other business partners, may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, which may include an increase in the frequency and severity of weather conditions and other natural cycles such as wildfires and droughts and shifts in climate patterns. The physical changes prompted by climate change could result in increased regulation or changes in consumer preferences and spending patterns. Such events have the potential to disrupt our operations and those of our franchisees, vendors and other business partners, cause store and factory closures, and impact our customers, employees and workers in our supply chain, all of which may adversely affect our business.General RisksOur business and results of operations could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, negative global climate patterns, or other catastrophic events.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, wildfires, and other extreme weather conditions; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics; political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, labor unrest, and other political instability; negative global climate patterns, especially in water stressed regions; or other catastrophic events or disasters occurring in or impacting the areas in which our stores, distribution centers, corporate offices or our vendors’ manufacturing facilities are located, whether occurring in the United States or internationally, could disrupt our, our franchisees' and our vendors' operations. Our disaster 19recovery and business continuity planning may not be sufficient in all instances to mitigate the impact of such catastrophic events.In particular, these types of events could impact our supply chain from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability or the ability of our franchisees or other third parties to operate our stores or websites. These types of events could also negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or globally, depending upon the severity. Disasters occurring at our vendors’ manufacturing facilities could impact our reputation and our customers’ perception of our brands. To the extent any of these events occur, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.Several military conflicts are taking place around the world which may adversely affect our business. The ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas have caused and may continue to cause instability and disruption in global markets. The potential impact of these conflicts and any resulting bans, sanctions and boycotts on our business is uncertain at the current time due to the fluid nature of these conflicts as they are unfolding in real-time. The potential impacts could include supply chain and logistics disruptions, volatility in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, inflationary pressures on raw materials and energy and heightened cybersecurity threats. We do not and cannot know if these conflicts could escalate and result in broader economic and security concerns which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Laws and regulations at the local, state, federal, and international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. In addition, we cannot predict with assurance the impact that may result from changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape. Such laws and regulations are complex and often subject to differing interpretations, which can lead to unintentional or unknown instances of non-compliance.Our failure, or the failure of our employees, franchisees, licensees, vendors, or other business partners, to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and any changes in laws or regulations, the imposition of additional laws or regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts employment and labor, anti-corruption, trade, product safety, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, cybersecurity, privacy, operations, or environmental issues, among others, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims from time to time, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.As a multinational company, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims (“Actions”) arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these Actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, intellectual property, customer, employment, securities, and data privacy claims, including class action lawsuits. The plaintiffs in some Actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages and some may be covered in part by insurance. We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of Actions brought against us. Additionally, defending against Actions may involve significant expense and diversion of management's attention and resources. Accordingly, developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and impact income in the quarter of such development, settlement, or resolution. An unfavorable outcome could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations"
2,GPS,GAP INC,2023-03-14,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.Our past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance because actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties discussed below and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K. In addition, historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In such case, the market price of our common stock could decline.Risks Related to Macroeconomic ConditionsGlobal economic conditions have and will likely continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our business is affected by global economic conditions and the related impact on consumer spending worldwide. Global economic conditions have impacted, and are likely to continue to impact, our business and other businesses around the world. Inflation, rising interest rates, rising energy and commodity prices and other macroeconomic pressures have led to recession fears and are creating a complex and challenging retail environment as customers reduce their discretionary spending. In particular, inflationary pressures negatively impacted our gross margins in fiscal 2022 due to commodity price increases. If inflationary pressures continue, and if we are unable to pass along price increases, our sales and results of operations will be negatively impacted in fiscal 2023.Some of the factors that may influence consumer spending patterns include high levels of unemployment, pandemics, extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, higher consumer debt levels, inflationary pressures, global geopolitical instability (including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine), reductions in net worth based on market declines and uncertainty, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, fluctuating interest and foreign currency rates and credit availability, government austerity measures, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Historically, consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower or during other periods of economic instability or uncertainty.Deteriorating economic conditions or geopolitical instability in any of the regions in which we and our franchisees sell our products could reduce consumer confidence and adversely impact consumer spending patterns, and thereby could adversely affect our sales and results of operations, and could also result in changes to the assumptions and estimates used when preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. Examples include, but are not limited to, assumptions and estimates used for inventory valuation, income taxes and valuation allowances, sales return and bad debt allowances, and the impairment of long-lived assets. In challenging and uncertain economic environments such as the current one, we cannot predict whether or when such circumstances may improve or worsen, or what impact, if any, such circumstances could have on our business, financial condition and results of operations, or on the price of our common stock.The COVID-19 pandemic has and could continue to adversely affect our business and results of operations.The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our business and results of operations and this adverse effect could continue. 8At the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak, we temporarily closed a significant number of our stores globally and furloughed the majority of our store teams. While we have since reopened our stores, we expect that certain parts of our operations will continue to be impacted by the continuing effects of COVID-19, and we and our franchisees may face new store closure requirements and other operational restrictions with respect to some or all of our physical locations for prolonged periods if the pandemic is not fully contained.The COVID-19 pandemic also significantly impacted our supply chain and may do so again in the future if the factories that manufacture our products, the distribution centers where we manage our inventory, or the operations of our logistics and other service providers are disrupted, temporarily closed or experience worker shortages. Vessel, container and other transportation shortages, factory closures, labor shortages and port congestion globally have in the past delayed and could in the future delay inventory orders and, in turn, deliveries to our and our franchisees' stores and distribution centers. These supply chain and logistics disruptions have impacted our inventory levels and sales in the past, and could impact our inventory levels and sales in future periods. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also closed many of our corporate offices and other facilities, including our corporate headquarters in San Francisco. Although we have since reopened our corporate offices and other facilities, we may face future closure requirements and other operational restrictions if the pandemic is not contained. These policies may also negatively impact productivity and cause other disruptions to our business.Risks Related to Our Brand Relevance and Brand ExecutionWe must successfully gauge apparel trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed.Our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our design and purchasing decisions may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing apparel trends or consumer acceptance of our products. Transportation shortages, factory closures, labor shortages, port congestion and other supply chain disruptions may lead to prolonged delays in receiving inventory. The global apparel retail business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences, dictated in part by apparel trends and season. To the extent we misjudge the market for our merchandise or the products suitable for local markets, or fail to execute trends and deliver products to the market as timely as our competitors, our sales will be adversely affected, and the markdowns required to move the resulting excess inventory will adversely affect our margins and results of operations.We must maintain our reputation and brand image.Our brands have wide recognition, and our success has been due in large part to our ability to maintain, enhance and protect our brand image and reputation and our customers’ connection to our brands. Our continued success depends in part on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. Even if we react appropriately to negative posts or comments about us and/or our brands on social media and online, our customers’ perception of our brand image and our reputation could be negatively impacted. Customer sentiment could also be shaped by our partnerships with artists, athletes and other public figures. Failure to maintain, enhance and protect our brand image could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Risks Related to CompetitionOur business is highly competitive.The global apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We and our franchisees compete with local, national, and global department stores, specialty and discount store chains, independent retail stores, and online businesses that market similar lines of merchandise. We face a variety of competitive challenges in an increasingly complex and fast-paced environment, including:•anticipating and quickly responding to changing apparel trends and customer demands;•attracting customer traffic both in stores and online;9•competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value;•maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to customers in several diverse market segments and geographic locations;•anticipating and responding to changing customer shopping preferences and practices, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement, social media communication, and online shopping;•developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to customers of varying demographics and tastes;•purchasing and stocking merchandise to match seasonal weather patterns, and our ability to react to shifts in weather that impact consumer demand;•sourcing and allocating merchandise efficiently; and•improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our processes in order to deliver cost savings to fund growth.If we or our franchisees are not able to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in retail markets or customer expectations in the United States or internationally, our results of operations would be adversely affected.Risks Related to Strategic Transactions and InvestmentsWe may engage in or seek to engage in strategic transactions, such as acquisitions, divestitures and other dispositions, or adjust our business strategies, all of which are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which could disrupt or adversely affect our business.We may engage in or seek to engage in strategic transactions, such as acquisitions, divestitures or other dispositions, which we may not be able to complete on anticipated terms or time frames or at all, or which may not generate some or all of the strategic, financial, operational or other benefits we expect to realize from such transactions on such anticipated time frames or at all. In addition, these transactions may be complex in nature, and unanticipated developments or changes, including changes in law, the macroeconomic environment, market conditions, the retail industry or political conditions may affect our ability to complete such transactions. In addition, the process of completing these transactions may be time-consuming and involve considerable costs and expenses, which may be significantly higher than what we anticipate and may not yield a benefit if the transactions are not completed successfully. Executing these transactions may require significant time and attention from our senior management and employees, which could disrupt our ongoing business and adversely affect our results of operations. We may also experience increased difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating employees and/or attracting and retaining customers during the pendency or following the completion of any of these transactions, which could harm our business.In 2021, we reached agreements to transfer our European business to a franchise model, and in 2022 we reached agreements to transition our Mexico and Greater China businesses to a franchise model. In 2021, we also divested our Janie and Jack and Intermix brands and acquired two technology companies. We incurred costs and expenses in connection with these transactions and may incur such costs and expenses in connection with future strategic reviews, which may require significant attention from our senior management and employees. Executing any transactions resulting from future strategic reviews will be time-consuming, will involve additional costs and expenses, which may be significant, and may result in difficulties attracting, retaining and motivating employees, which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.We have adjusted and may further adjust our business strategies to meet changes in our business environment. For example, in 2022 we took steps to reduce open and existing corporate roles, renegotiate our advertising agency contracts, reduce technology operating costs, and rationalize digital investments. Our new organization and strategies could be less successful than our previous organizational structure and strategies, are subject to execution risk, and may not produce the anticipated benefits. 10Our investments in customer, digital, and omni-channel shopping initiatives may not deliver the results we anticipate.One of our strategic priorities is to further develop an omni-channel shopping experience for our customers through the integration of our store and digital shopping channels. Our omni-channel initiatives include cross-channel logistics optimization and exploring additional ways to develop an omni-channel shopping experience, including further digital integration and customer personalization. These initiatives involve significant investments in information technology (""IT"") systems, data science and artificial intelligence initiatives, and significant operational changes. Our competitors are also investing in omni-channel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives. If the implementation of our customer, digital, and omni-channel initiatives is not successful, or we do not realize the return on our investments in these initiatives that we anticipate, our results of operations would be adversely affected.Risks Related to Human Capital, Inventory and Supply Chain ManagementIf we are unable to manage or protect our inventory effectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected.Fluctuations in the global apparel retail markets impact the levels of inventory owned by apparel retailers. The nature of the global apparel retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to the peak holiday selling season when we build up our inventory levels. Merchandise usually must be ordered well in advance of the season and frequently before apparel trends are confirmed by customer purchases. We must enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise long before the applicable selling season, and transportation shortages, factory closures, labor shortages, port congestion and other supply chain disruptions may lead to prolonged delays in receiving inventory. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. We have not always predicted our customers’ preferences and acceptance levels of our trend items with accuracy. For example, in 2022, certain product did not meet consumer preferences resulting in higher levels of promotional activity and lower-than-planned gross margins and, in some cases, we were required to take significant impairment charges on unproductive inventory. If sales do not meet expectations, including due to the impact of current macroeconomic conditions on consumer demand, too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower-than-planned gross margins. As a result, we may also be required to take significant impairment charges on delayed or unproductive inventory.Conversely, if we underestimate or are unable to satisfy consumer demand for our products, we may experience inventory shortages, which could result in lower than anticipated sales, delayed shipments to customers and negative impacts on consumer relationships and brand loyalty, which could adversely affect our results of operations.We have key strategic initiatives designed to optimize our inventory levels and increase the efficiency and responsiveness of our supply chain, including vendor fabric platforming, product demand testing, and in-season rapid response to demand. We are also developing additional capabilities to analyze customer behavior and demand, which we believe will allow us to better localize assortment and improve store-level allocations, such as size allocation, to further tailor our assortments to customer needs and increase sell-through. Further, we are leveraging technology and data science to digitize product creation, integrate with our consolidated vendor base, and further optimize our product-to-market processes and supply chain which we anticipate will enhance our in-season responsiveness and reduce our exposure to fashion volatility. These initiatives and additional capabilities involve significant changes to our inventory management systems and processes. If we are unable to implement these initiatives and integrate these additional capabilities successfully, we may not realize the return on our investments that we anticipate, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.Risk of loss or theft of assets, including inventory shrinkage, is inherent in the retail business. Loss may be caused by error or misconduct of employees, customers, vendors or other third parties including through organized retail crime and professional theft. While some level of inventory shrinkage is unavoidable, if we were to experience higher rates of inventory shrinkage, or if we were unable to effectively reduce the impact of loss or theft of assets, our results of operations could be affected adversely.11Our failure to manage key executive succession and retention and to continue to attract qualified personnel could adversely affect our results of operations.The loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor to a key role could adversely affect our business. We made significant changes to our executive leadership team in recent years and are currently searching for a non-interim CEO. The failure to successfully transition and assimilate key employees, including our new CEO, the effectiveness of our leaders, and any further transition, could adversely affect our results of operations.In addition, our business and future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel in our design, merchandising, sourcing, marketing, and other functions. In addition, executing our strategic initiatives, including our technology and supply chain initiatives, has required and may require in the future that we hire and/or develop employees with appropriate and specialized experience. We must also attract, develop, and retain a sufficient number of qualified field and distribution center personnel. Competition for talent is intense and the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high. Furthermore, we have experienced a shortage of labor for field and distribution center positions, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel for these and other positions in future periods. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates and competitive wage pressures, minimum wage legislation, and overtime and paid leave regulations. Additionally, changes to our office environments and our requirements and/or expectations about when or how often certain employees work on-site or remotely may not meet the expectations of our employees. As businesses increasingly operate remotely, traditional geographic competition for talent may change in ways that we cannot presently predict. If our employment proposition is not perceived as favorable compared to other companies, it could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain our employees. If we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate talented employees with the appropriate skill sets, or if changes to our organizational structure or business model adversely affect morale or retention, we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted.Our business is subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing.Independent third parties manufacture all of our products for us. As a result, we are directly impacted by increases in the cost of those products.If we experience significant increases in demand or need to replace an existing vendor, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or that any vendor would allocate sufficient capacity to us to meet our requirements. In addition, for any new manufacturing source, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our vendors in our methods, products, quality control standards, and environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. Moreover, in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Any delays, interruptions, or increased costs in the manufacture of our products could impact our ability to source product and result in lower than anticipated sales. A large portion of our global sourcing comes from a few specific countries. For example, in fiscal 2022, approximately 30 percent and 17 percent of our merchandise, by dollar value, was purchased from factories in Vietnam and Indonesia, respectively. Delays in production and added costs in Vietnam or Indonesia have in the past adversely affected and in the future could adversely affect our results of operations.12Because independent vendors manufacture virtually all of our products outside of our principal sales markets, third parties must transport our products over large geographic distances. Increases in transportation costs and/or delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, port and infrastructure congestion, public health emergencies, social unrest, changes in local economic conditions, political upheavals, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with transitioning between vendors, could adversely affect our results of operations. Operating or manufacturing delays, transportation delays, or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as air freight, which have in the past adversely affected and in the future could adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, the cost of fuel is a significant component of transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products (including due to inflationary pressures, political instability, and/or regulation of energy inputs and greenhouse gas emissions) could adversely affect our gross margins.If our vendors, or any raw material suppliers on which our vendors rely, suffer prolonged manufacturing or transportation disruptions due to public health conditions or other unforeseen events, our ability to source product could be adversely impacted which would adversely affect our sales and results of operations.Risks associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries, including failure of our vendors to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct, could harm our business.We purchase merchandise from third-party vendors in many different countries, and we require those vendors to adhere to a Code of Vendor Conduct, which includes anti-corruption, environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. From time to time, our vendors and their suppliers may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable local laws. Although we have implemented policies and procedures to facilitate our compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from and into various countries, there can be no assurance that our vendors and their suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more vendors, suppliers or other third parties could subject us to liability, and could adversely affect our reputation, business and results of operations.Risks Related to Data Privacy and CybersecurityWe are subject to data and security risks, which could adversely affect our results of operations and consumer confidence in our security measures.As part of our normal operations, we receive and maintain confidential, proprietary, and personally identifiable information, including credit card information, and information about our customers, our employees, job applicants, and other third parties. Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of this information. However, despite our safeguards and security processes and protections, security breaches and vulnerabilities could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. The retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. We may not have the resources to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks, such as phishing and ransomware attacks, which have become particularly prevalent. While we train our employees to identify these and other security threats as part of our security efforts, this training cannot be completely effective. Attacks may be targeted at us, our vendors or customers, or others who have entrusted us with personal or confidential information. Although we strive to take appropriate measures to safeguard our information security and privacy environment from security breaches and vulnerabilities, we could still expose our customers and our business to risk. 13Actual or anticipated attacks may disrupt or impair our technology capabilities, and may cause us to incur costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. Measures we implement to protect against cyberattacks and address vulnerabilities may also have the potential to impact our customers’ shopping experience or decrease activity on our websites by making them more difficult to use. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. The global regulatory environment surrounding information security, cybersecurity, and data privacy is increasingly demanding, and we are required to comply with new and constantly evolving laws, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act, the California Privacy Rights Act and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, each of which gives customers the right to control how their personal information is collected, used and retained. Our failure to comply with these and other data privacy laws or to secure personal or confidential information could result in significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of consumer confidence in our security measures, which could adversely affect our results of operations and our reputation.Failures of, or updates or changes to, our IT systems may disrupt operations.We maintain a complex technology platform consisting of both legacy and modern systems, and we also increasingly rely on third party providers for public cloud infrastructure that powers our e-commerce platform and other systems. Our owned and operated systems require continual maintenance, upgrades and changes, some of which are significant. Upgrades may involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of the inherent risks associated with maintaining and replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and addressing system disruptions, and believe we are taking appropriate steps to mitigate these risks through testing, training, and staging implementation, as well as ensuring appropriate commercial contracts are in place with third party vendors supplying or supporting our IT initiatives. However, there can be no assurance that we will successfully maintain or launch these systems as planned or that they will be implemented without disruptions to our operations. IT system disruptions or failures, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, or failure to successfully implement new or upgraded systems, could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations. While the uptime, performance, and security of our third party public cloud infrastructure providers are generally equal to or better than our own systems, as we continue to move to their platforms, our reliance on third parties means that any downtime or security issues they experience poses a greater risk of a single point of failure. Any failure by our third party providers could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations.Risks Related to Operating a Global BusinessOur business and results of operations could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, negative global climate patterns, or other catastrophic events.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, wildfires, and other extreme weather conditions; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics; political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, labor unrest, and other political instability; negative global climate patterns, especially in water stressed regions; or other catastrophic events or disasters occurring in or impacting the areas in which our stores, distribution centers, corporate offices or our vendors’ manufacturing facilities are located, whether occurring in the United States or internationally, could disrupt our, our franchisees' and our vendors' operations. While we consider these types of catastrophic events as part of our disaster recovery and business continuity planning, our planning may not be sufficient in all instances.14In particular, these types of events could impact our supply chain from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability or the ability of our franchisees or other third parties to operate our stores or websites. These types of events could also negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or globally, depending upon the severity. Disasters occurring at our vendors’ manufacturing facilities could impact our reputation and our customers’ perception of our brands. To the extent any of these events occur, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has caused and continues to cause instability and disruption in global markets. In February 2022, in response to the conflict, the United States and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states, as well as non-member states, announced targeted economic sanctions on Russia, including certain Russian citizens and enterprises, and the continuation of the conflict may trigger additional economic and other sanctions. The potential impact of the conflict and any resulting bans, sanctions and boycotts on our business is uncertain at the current time due to the fluid nature of the conflict as it is unfolding in real-time. The potential impacts could include supply chain and logistics disruptions, volatility in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, inflationary pressures on raw materials and energy and heightened cybersecurity threats. We do not and cannot know if the conflict could escalate and result in broader economic and security concerns which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful.Our current business strategies include pursuing selective international expansion in a number of countries around the world through a number of channels. This includes our franchisees opening additional stores internationally. We have limited experience operating or franchising in some of these locations. In many of these locations, we face major established competitors. In addition, in many of these locations, the real estate, employment and labor, transportation and logistics, and other operating requirements differ dramatically from those in the places where we have more experience. Consumer tastes and trends may differ in these locations and, as a result, the sales of our products may not be successful or result in the margins we anticipate. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our results of operations could be adversely affected.Our franchise and licensing businesses are subject to certain risks not directly within our control that could impair the value of our brands.We have entered into franchise agreements to operate stores and websites in many countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores and websites that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. We have also entered into licensing agreements to sell products using our brand names. The effect of these arrangements on our business and results of operations is uncertain and will depend upon various factors, including the demand for our products in international markets, the demand for new product categories and our ability to successfully identify appropriate third parties to act as franchisees, licensees, distributors, or in a similar capacity. In addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as franchisee and licensee financial stability and the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store locations, store openings, and sales. Additionally, certain of our franchisees have been unable to, and may in the future be unable to make payments to landlords, distributors and suppliers, as well as payments to service any debt they may have outstanding, including to us. We have also provided loan guarantees to various lenders on behalf of certain franchisees, and have guaranteed or are contingently liable for certain franchisees' leases. These arrangements could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations.Other risks that may affect these third parties include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, foreign exchange rates, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and geopolitical instability. Moreover, while the franchise and licensing agreements we have entered into and plan to enter into in the future provide us with certain termination rights, the value of our brands could be impaired to the extent that these third parties do not operate their stores or websites or sell our branded products in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee or licensee, could also adversely affect our results of operations and our reputation.15Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain.Trade restrictions, including more stringent tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States or other countries, including the likelihood, type, or effect of any such restrictions. For example, the current political landscape, including with respect to U.S.-China relations, and recent tariffs and bans imposed by the United States and other countries (such as the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act) has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to future tax and trade regulations. In addition, we face the possibility of anti-dumping or countervailing duties lawsuits from U.S. domestic producers. We are unable to determine the impact of the changes to the quota system or the impact that potential tariff lawsuits could have on our global sourcing operations. Our sourcing operations may be adversely affected by trade limits or political and financial instability, resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries, significant fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, restrictions on the transfer of funds, or other trade disruptions. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, such as the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Our business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and our hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks.We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, operating expenses, profits, assets, and liabilities generated or incurred in foreign currencies as well as inventory purchases in U.S. dollars for our foreign subsidiaries. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact consumer spending or adversely affect the profitability of our foreign operations or those of our franchisees and licensees. Global economic and geopolitical uncertainty, such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, has resulted and in the future could result in volatility in foreign exchange rates. Although we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in fully offsetting the negative impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally only delay the impact of adverse foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations.We experience fluctuations in our comparable sales and margins, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, our credit ratings and our liquidity.Our success depends in part on our ability to grow sales and improve margins. A variety of factors affect comparable sales and/or margins, including but not limited to apparel trends, competition, current economic conditions (including due to macroeconomic pressures, geopolitical instability or the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic), the timing of new merchandise releases and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of our marketing programs (including our loyalty program), supply chain disruptions and transitory costs, foreign currency fluctuations, industry traffic trends, and weather conditions. These factors may cause our comparable sales results and margins to differ materially from prior periods and from financial market expectations. Our comparable sales, including the associated comparable online sales, have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual and quarterly basis. In fiscal 2022, our reported quarterly comparable sales have ranged from a high of 1 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 to a low of negative 14 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Over the past five fiscal years, our reported gross margins have ranged from a high of 39.8 percent in fiscal 2021 to a low of 34.1 percent in fiscal 2020. In addition, over the past five fiscal years, our reported operating margins have ranged from a high of 8.2 percent in fiscal 2018 to a low of negative 6.2 percent in fiscal 2020.Our ability to deliver strong comparable sales results and margins depends in large part on accurately forecasting demand and apparel trends, selecting effective marketing techniques, providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base, managing inventory effectively, using effective pricing strategies, and optimizing store performance. Fluctuations in our comparable sales and margins or failure to meet financial market expectations in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of our common stock, cause our credit ratings to decline, and negatively impact our liquidity.16The global market for real estate is competitive.Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices nationally and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics, and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases. In addition, we may seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition, relocate, or close some of our real estate locations, which in most cases requires a modification or termination of an existing store lease. Since the beginning of fiscal 2020, in connection with our Power Plan strategy, we have closed hundreds of Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America. Failure to secure adequate new locations, successfully modify or exit existing locations, or effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, could adversely affect our results of operations.Additionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties within the United States and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to enter into leases, exercise lease options and/or renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.Climate change may have an adverse impact on our business.While we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing environmental goals and standards and seeking business partners, including within our supply chain, that are committed to operating in ways that protect the environment or mitigate environmental impacts, we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Our properties and operations, and those of our franchisees, vendors and other business partners, may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, which may include an increase in the frequency and severity of weather conditions and other natural cycles such as wildfires and droughts and shifts in climate patterns. The physical changes prompted by climate change could result in increased regulation or changes in consumer preferences and spending patterns. Such events have the potential to disrupt our operations and those of our franchisees, vendors and other business partners, cause store and factory closures, and impact our customers, employees and workers in our supply chain, all of which may cause us to suffer losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations.We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims from time to time, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.As a multinational company, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims (“Actions”) arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these Actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, intellectual property, customer, employment, securities, and data privacy claims, including class action lawsuits. The plaintiffs in some Actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages and some may be covered in part by insurance. We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of Actions brought against us. Additionally, defending against Actions may involve significant expense and diversion of management's attention and resources. Accordingly, developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and impact income in the quarter of such development, settlement, or resolution. An unfavorable outcome could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Risks Related to Governmental and Regulatory ChangesFailure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Laws and regulations at the local, state, federal, and international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. In addition, we cannot predict with assurance the impact that may result from changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape. While our policies are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, such laws and regulations are complex and often subject to differing interpretations, which can lead to unintentional or unknown instances of non-compliance.17Our failure, or the failure of our employees, franchisees, licensees, vendors, or other business partners, to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and any changes in laws or regulations, the imposition of additional laws or regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts employment and labor, anti-corruption, trade, product safety, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, cybersecurity, privacy, operations, or environmental issues, among others, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our business is subject to evolving regulations and expectations with respect to environmental, social and governance matters that could expose us to numerous risks.Increasingly regulators, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are focusing on ESG matters and related disclosures. These developments have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting ESG-related requirements and expectations. For example, developing and acting on ESG-related initiatives, including design, sourcing and operations decisions, and collecting, measuring and reporting ESG-related information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards, including the SEC’s proposed climate-related reporting requirements. We may also communicate certain ESG-related initiatives and goals in our SEC filings or in other public disclosures. These ESG-related initiatives and goals could be difficult and expensive to implement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and may not advance at a sufficient pace, and we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of the disclosure. Further, statements about our ESG-related initiatives and goals, and progress against those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope or nature of such initiatives or goals, or for any revisions to these goals. If our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to our ESG-related goals on a timely basis, or at all, our reputation, business, financial performance and growth could be adversely affected.Risks Related to Our Credit Card ArrangementReductions in income and cash flow from our credit card arrangement related to our private label and co-branded credit cards could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.A third party, Barclays Bank Delaware (""Barclays""), currently issues and services our portfolios of private label credit card and co-branded credit card programs for our Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta brands. Our agreement with Barclays provides for certain payments to be made by Barclays to us, including a share of revenues from the performance of the credit card portfolios. The income and cash flow that we receive from Barclays is dependent upon a number of factors, including the level of sales on private label and co-branded accounts, the level of balances carried on the accounts, payment rates on the accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on the accounts, the level of credit losses for the accounts, Barclay’s ability to extend credit to our customers, as well as the cost of customer rewards programs. All of these factors can vary based on changes in federal and state credit card, banking, and consumer protection laws. The factors affecting the income and cash flow that we receive from our credit card arrangement can also vary based on a variety of economic, legal, social, and other factors that we cannot control. If the income and cash flow that we receive from our credit card arrangement decreases significantly, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and Credit ProfileIn July 2022, we amended and restated our senior secured asset-based revolving credit agreement (the ""ABL Facility"") and increased the borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility to $2.2 billion. In September 2021, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.625 percent Senior Notes due 2029 (the ""2029 Senior Notes"") and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.875 percent Senior Notes due 2031 (the ""2031 Senior Notes"" and, with the 2029 Senior Notes, the ""Senior Notes""), which remain outstanding. As a result, we are subject to risks relating to our indebtedness, including the following risks.18See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"" of this Form 10-K for disclosures on our debt and credit facilities.Our level of indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to operate and expand our business.We have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of January 28, 2023, the aggregate principal amount of our total outstanding indebtedness was $1.5 billion under the Senior Notes and $350 million of borrowings under the ABL Facility. As of January 28, 2023, we had $1.85 billion in principal amount of undrawn commitments available for additional borrowings under the ABL Facility, subject to borrowing base availability.Our high level of indebtedness could impact our business in the following ways:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations, including with respect to the Senior Notes and ABL Facility;•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and external conditions, including recent inflationary pressures;•impair our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes;•require us to dedicate a material portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;•expose us to the risk of increased interest rates for borrowings under the ABL Facility, which bear interest at a variable rate;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;•place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; and•limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions.Any of these risks could impact our ability to operate and expand our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we may in the future incur additional indebtedness, which could intensify these risks and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and fund our working capital and capital expenditures, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.We are required to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flows from operations to the payment of interest and principal under our indebtedness. We generated net cash from operating activities of $607 million in fiscal 2022 and ended fiscal 2022 with $1,215 million of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet.Our ability to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness depends upon our future operating performance and on our ability to generate cash flows in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our debt service obligations and other liquidity needs.If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investment and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity financing or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures (including due to restrictions in our indebtedness agreements), if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.19If we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, we will be in default and, as a result, our lenders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, could terminate their commitments to loan money to us and could foreclose against any assets securing our indebtedness under the ABL Facility, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.Covenants in the ABL Facility may restrict our business and could limit our ability to implement our business plan.The ABL Facility includes covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to do the following under certain circumstances:•grant or incur liens;•sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;•make investments in certain subsidiaries;•pay dividends, make distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock; and•consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to another entity.Compliance with these and the other covenants in the ABL Facility may restrict our ability to implement our business plan, finance future operations, respond to changing business and economic conditions, secure additional financing, and engage in opportunistic transactions, such as strategic acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with our financial or other covenants under the ABL Facility or that any covenant violations would be waived in the future. Any violation that is not waived could result in an event of default and, as a result, our lenders under the ABL Facility could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, could suspend commitments to make any advances or could require any outstanding letters of credit to be collateralized by an interest bearing cash account, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the capital markets and adversely impact our business and financial condition.We currently have corporate credit ratings of BB with a negative outlook from Standard & Poor's and Ba2 with a negative outlook from Moody’s. Any reduction in our credit ratings could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets, more restrictive covenants in future financing documents and higher interest costs, and potentially increased lease or hedging costs. In addition, market conditions such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing or refinance existing debt on terms that would be acceptable to us"
15,GPS,GAP INC,2022-03-15,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.Our past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance because actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties discussed below and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K. In addition, historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In such case, the market price of our common stock could decline.Risks Related to Macroeconomic ConditionsThe COVID-19 pandemic has and could continue to adversely affect our business and results of operations.The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our business and results of operations and this adverse effect could continue. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in response to government mandates or recommendations, as well as decisions we made to protect the health and safety of our employees, consumers and communities, in fiscal 2020, we temporarily closed a significant number of our stores globally and furloughed the majority of our store teams. While we began to safely reopen our temporarily closed stores in May 2020 and have since reopened most of our stores, we and our franchisees may face new store closure requirements and other operational restrictions with respect to some or all of our physical locations for prolonged periods if the pandemic is not fully contained.Further, consumer fears about becoming ill with COVID-19 may continue, which has and could continue to adversely affect traffic to our and our franchisees’ stores. Consumer spending generally has and may continue to be negatively impacted by general macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence, including the impacts of any recession or inflationary pressures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This may negatively impact sales at our stores and on our e-commerce platform, and through our franchise agreements. Furthermore, if sales do not meet expectations because of unexpected effects on consumer demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the resulting surplus inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower than planned gross margins. Any significant reduction in consumer visits to, or spending at, our and our franchisees’ stores caused by the pandemic, and any decreased spending at stores or online caused by decreased consumer confidence and spending resulting from the pandemic, would adversely affect our sales and results of operations.The COVID-19 pandemic also has significantly impacted our supply chain and may continue to do so if the factories that manufacture our products, the distribution centers where we manage our inventory, or the operations of our logistics and other service providers are disrupted, temporarily closed or experience worker shortages. Vessel, container and other transportation shortages, factory closures, labor shortages and port congestion globally have delayed and are expected to continue to delay inventory orders and, in turn, deliveries to our and our franchisees' stores and distribution centers. These supply chain and logistics disruptions have impacted our inventory levels and net sales, particularly in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021, and could impact our sales in future periods. These disruptions could also result in our receiving inventory after the intended selling season and therefore require us to take significant impairment charges on delayed inventory when it is finally received. We have also incurred in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021 higher freight and other distribution costs, including air freight, to mitigate these delays, and we expect to continue incurring higher freight and distribution costs in fiscal 2022. Furthermore, in the event we experience negative impacts to pricing of certain components of our products resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance that consumers will accept such increases, which could adversely affect our results of operations.10As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including related governmental guidance or requirements, in 2020 we also closed many of our corporate offices and other facilities, including our corporate headquarters in San Francisco. Although we reopened our corporate offices and other facilities beginning in June 2020 and have implemented remote work or hybrid work policies for certain employees, we may face future closure requirements and other operational restrictions if the pandemic is not fully contained. These policies may also negatively impact productivity and cause other disruptions to our business.We continue to monitor the latest developments regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and have made certain assumptions regarding the pandemic for purposes of our operating and financial projections. However, we are unable to accurately predict the full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our business and results of operations due to the uncertainty of future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, the success of vaccination efforts, any resurgences of the virus or variants of the virus and the economic impacts of the pandemic, including recent inflationary pressures. Even in regions where we have experienced business recovery, the failure to fully contain the pandemic could result in those markets not recovering as quickly or at all, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The pandemic may also affect our business and results of operations in manners that are not presently known to us or that we do not presently consider to pose significant risks.Global economic conditions and any related impact on consumer spending patterns could adversely affect our results of operations.Our business is affected by global economic conditions and the related impact on levels of consumer spending worldwide. Some of the factors that may influence consumer spending patterns include high levels of unemployment, pandemics (such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, higher consumer debt levels, inflationary pressures (such as current inflation related to global supply chain disruptions), global geopolitical instability (such as the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine and related economic and other retaliatory measures taken by the United States, European Union and others), reductions in net worth based on market declines and uncertainty, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, fluctuating interest and foreign currency rates and credit availability, government austerity measures, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or when there are inflationary pressures or economic uncertainty.The uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world. Deteriorating economic conditions or geopolitical instability in any of the regions in which we and our franchisees sell our products could reduce consumer confidence and adversely impact consumer spending patterns, and thereby could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. In challenging and uncertain economic environments such as the current one, we cannot predict whether or when such circumstances may improve or worsen, or what impact, if any, such circumstances could have on our business, financial condition and results of operations, or on the price of our common stock.Recent inflationary pressures have increased the cost of energy and raw materials and may adversely affect our results of operations. If inflation continues to rise and further impact the cost of energy and raw materials, we may not be able to offset cost increases to our products through price adjustments without negatively impacting consumer demand, which could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.11Risks Related to Our Brand Relevance and Brand ExecutionWe must successfully gauge apparel trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed.Our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our design and purchasing decisions may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing apparel trends or consumer acceptance of our products, and supply chain disruptions may lead to prolonged delays in receiving inventory. The global apparel retail business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences, dictated in part by apparel trends and season. To the extent we misjudge the market for our merchandise or the products suitable for local markets, or fail to execute trends and deliver products to the market as timely as our competitors, our sales will be adversely affected, and the markdowns required to move the resulting excess inventory will adversely affect our results of operations.We must maintain our reputation and brand image.Our brands have wide recognition, and our success has been due in large part to our ability to maintain, enhance and protect our brand image and reputation and our customers’ connection to our brands. Our continued success depends in part on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. Even if we react appropriately to negative posts or comments about us and/or our brands on social media and online, our customers’ perception of our brand image and our reputation could be negatively impacted. Customer sentiment could also be shaped by our partnerships with artists, athletes and other public figures. Failure to maintain, enhance and protect our brand image could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Our brand image and reputation may also depend on our environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") policies, priorities and commitments and related design, sourcing and operations decisions. These risks may include any increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on these matters. These risks may also include increased pressure to expand our disclosures in these areas, make commitments, set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them, which could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks. Our failure to achieve progress on our stated commitments, targets or goals on a timely basis, or at all, could adversely affect our brand image and reputation.Risks Related to CompetitionOur business is highly competitive.The global apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We and our franchisees compete with local, national, and global department stores, specialty and discount store chains, independent retail stores, and online businesses that market similar lines of merchandise. We face a variety of competitive challenges in an increasingly complex and fast-paced environment, including:•anticipating and quickly responding to changing apparel trends and customer demands;•attracting customer traffic both in stores and online;•competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value;•maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to customers in several diverse market segments and geographic locations;•anticipating and responding to changing customer shopping preferences and practices, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement, social media communication, and online shopping;•developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to customers of varying demographics and tastes;•purchasing and stocking merchandise to match seasonal weather patterns, and our ability to react to shifts in weather that impact consumer demand;•sourcing and allocating merchandise efficiently; and12•improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our processes in order to deliver cost savings to fund growth.If we or our franchisees are not able to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in retail markets or customer expectations in the United States or internationally, our results of operations would be adversely affected.Risks Related to Strategic Transactions and InvestmentsWe may engage in or seek to engage in strategic transactions, such as acquisitions, divestitures and other dispositions, that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which could disrupt or adversely affect our business.We may engage in or seek to engage in strategic transactions, such as acquisitions, divestitures or other dispositions, which we may not be able to complete on anticipated terms or time frames or at all, or which may not generate some or all of the strategic, financial, operational or other benefits we expect to realize from such transactions on such anticipated time frames or at all. In addition, these transactions may be complex in nature, and unanticipated developments or changes, including changes in law, the macroeconomic environment, market conditions, the retail industry or political conditions may affect our ability to complete such transactions. In addition, the process of completing these transactions may be time-consuming and involve significant costs and expenses, which may be significantly higher than what we anticipate and may not yield a benefit if the transactions are not completed successfully, and executing these transactions may require significant time and attention from our senior management and employees, which could disrupt our ongoing business and adversely affect our results of operations. We may also experience increased difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating employees and/or attracting and retaining customers during the pendency or following the completion of any of these transactions, which could harm our business.In particular, in 2021 we divested our Janie and Jack and Intermix brands and reached agreements to transfer our European business to a franchise model. We also acquired two technology companies in 2021. We incurred costs and expenses in connection with these transactions and may incur such costs and expenses in connection with future strategic reviews, which will require significant attention from our senior management and employees. Executing any transactions resulting from future strategic reviews will be time-consuming, will involve additional costs and expenses, which may be significant, and may result in difficulties attracting, retaining and motivating employees, which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.Our investments in customer, digital, and omni-channel shopping initiatives may not deliver the results we anticipate.One of our strategic priorities is to further develop an omni-channel shopping experience for our customers through the integration of our store and digital shopping channels. Our omni-channel initiatives include cross-channel logistics optimization and exploring additional ways to develop an omni-channel shopping experience, including further digital integration and customer personalization. These initiatives involve significant investments in information technology (""IT"") systems, data science and artificial intelligence initiatives, and significant operational changes. Our competitors are also investing in omni-channel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives. If the implementation of our customer, digital, and omni-channel initiatives is not successful, or we do not realize the return on our investments in these initiatives that we anticipate, our results of operations would be adversely affected.13Risks Related to Human Capital, Inventory and Supply Chain ManagementOur failure to manage key executive succession and retention and to continue to attract qualified personnel could adversely affect our results of operations.Our business and future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel in our design, merchandising, sourcing, marketing, and other functions. In addition, executing our strategic initiatives, including our technology and supply chain initiatives, has required and may require in the future that we hire and/or develop employees with appropriate and specialized experience. We must also attract, develop, and retain a sufficient number of qualified field and distribution center personnel. Competition for talent is intense and the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high. Furthermore, we have experienced a shortage of labor for field and distribution center positions, including due to concerns around COVID-19 and other factors, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel for these and other positions in future periods. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates and competitive wage pressures, minimum wage legislation, and overtime and paid leave regulations. Additionally, changes to our office environments, the adoption of new work models, and our requirements and/or expectations about when or how often certain employees work on-site or remotely may not meet the expectations of our employees. As businesses increasingly operate remotely, traditional geographic competition for talent may change in ways that we cannot presently predict. If our employment proposition is not perceived as favorable compared to other companies, it could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain our employees. If we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate talented employees with the appropriate skill sets, or if changes to our organizational structure or business model adversely affect morale or retention, we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor to a key role could adversely affect our business. In 2019 and 2020, we made significant changes to our executive leadership team. The effectiveness of our leaders, and any further transition, could adversely affect our results of operations.If we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected.Fluctuations in the global apparel retail markets impact the levels of inventory owned by apparel retailers. The nature of the global apparel retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to the peak holiday selling season when we build up our inventory levels. Merchandise usually must be ordered well in advance of the season and frequently before apparel trends are confirmed by customer purchases. We must enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season, and supply chain delays may increase lead times. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. In the past, we have not always predicted our customers’ preferences and acceptance levels of our trend items with accuracy. If sales do not meet expectations, including due to the impact of current economic conditions (including due to inflationary pressures, political instability or the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic) on consumer demand, too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower-than-planned gross margins. Conversely, if we underestimate or are unable to satisfy consumer demand for our products, including due to increasing consumer demand in areas where the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic decrease or supply chain disruptions that result in delayed inventory, we may experience inventory shortages, which could result in lower than anticipated sales, delayed shipments to customers and negative impacts on consumer relationships and brand loyalty, which could adversely affect our results of operations.14We have key strategic initiatives designed to optimize our inventory levels and increase the efficiency and responsiveness of our supply chain, including vendor fabric platforming, product demand testing, and in-season rapid response to demand. We are also developing additional capabilities to analyze customer behavior and demand, which we believe will allow us to better localize assortment and improve store-level allocations, such as size allocation, to further tailor our assortments to customer needs and increase sell-through. Further, we are leveraging technology and data science to digitize product creation, integrate with our consolidated vendor base, and further optimize our product-to-market processes and supply chain which we anticipate will enhance our in-season responsiveness and reduce our exposure to fashion volatility. These initiatives and additional capabilities involve significant changes to our inventory management systems and processes. If we are unable to implement these initiatives and integrate these additional capabilities successfully, we may not realize the return on our investments that we anticipate, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.Our business is subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing.Independent third parties manufacture all of our products for us. As a result, we are directly impacted by increases in the cost of those products.If we experience significant increases in demand or need to replace an existing vendor, including due to factory closures and labor shortages in the countries where our vendors are located, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or that any vendor would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, for any new manufacturing source, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our vendors in our methods, products, quality control standards, and environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. Moreover, in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the manufacture of our products could result in lower than anticipated sales. In addition, certain countries represent a larger portion of our global sourcing. For example, in fiscal 2021, approximately 33 percent and 16 percent of our merchandise, by dollar value, was purchased from factories in Vietnam and Indonesia, respectively. Delays in production and added costs in Vietnam or Indonesia have and could continue to adversely affect our results of operations.Because independent vendors manufacture virtually all of our products outside of our principal sales markets, third parties must transport our products over large geographic distances. Increases in transportation costs and/or delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, port and infrastructure congestion, public health emergencies, social unrest, changes in local economic conditions, political upheavals, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with transitioning between vendors, could adversely affect our results of operations. Operating or manufacturing delays, transportation delays, or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as air freight, which could adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, the cost of fuel is a significant component of transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products (including due to inflationary pressures, political instability, and/or regulation of energy inputs and greenhouse gas emissions) can adversely affect our gross margins.If our vendors, or any raw material suppliers on which our vendors rely, suffer prolonged manufacturing or transportation disruptions due to public health conditions, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or other unforeseen events, our ability to source product could be adversely impacted which would adversely affect our results of operations.15Risks associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries, including failure of our vendors to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct, could harm our business.We purchase merchandise from third-party vendors in many different countries, and we require those vendors to adhere to a Code of Vendor Conduct, which includes anti-corruption, environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. From time to time, our vendors and their suppliers may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable local laws. Although we have implemented policies and procedures to facilitate our compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from and into various countries, there can be no assurance that our vendors and their suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more vendors, suppliers or other third parties could  subject us to liability, and could adversely affect our reputation, business and results of operations.Risks Related to Data Privacy and CybersecurityWe are subject to data and security risks, which could adversely affect our results of operations and consumer confidence in our security measures.As part of our normal operations, we receive and maintain confidential, proprietary, and personally identifiable information, including credit card information, and information about our customers, our employees, job applicants, and other third parties. Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of this information. However, despite our safeguards and security processes and protections, security breaches and vulnerabilities could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. The retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. We may not have the resources to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks, such as phishing and ransomware attacks, which have emerged as particularly prominent. While we train our employees to identify these and other security threats as part of our security efforts, this training cannot be completely effective. Attacks may be targeted at us, our vendors or customers, or others who have entrusted us with personal or confidential information. In addition, even if we take appropriate measures to safeguard our information security and privacy environment from security breaches and vulnerabilities, we could still expose our customers and our business to risk. Actual or anticipated attacks may disrupt or impair our technology capabilities, and may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. Measures we implement to protect against cyberattacks and address vulnerabilities may also have the potential to impact our customers’ shopping experience or decrease activity on our websites by making them more difficult to use. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. In addition, the global regulatory environment surrounding information security, cybersecurity, and data privacy is increasingly demanding, and we are required to comply with new and constantly evolving laws, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act, the California Privacy Rights Act and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, each of which gives customers the right to control how their personal information is collected, used and retained. Our failure to comply with these and other data privacy laws or to secure personal or confidential information could result in significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of consumer confidence in our security measures, which could adversely affect our results of operations and our reputation.16Failures of, or updates or changes to, our IT systems may disrupt operations.We maintain a complex technology platform consisting of both legacy and modern systems, and we also increasingly rely on third party providers for public cloud infrastructure that powers our e-commerce platform and other systems. Our owned and operated systems require continual maintenance, upgrades and changes, some of which are significant. Upgrades may involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of the inherent risks associated with maintaining and replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and addressing system disruptions, and believe we are taking appropriate steps to mitigate these risks through testing, training, and staging implementation, as well as ensuring appropriate commercial contracts are in place with third party vendors supplying or supporting our IT initiatives. However, there can be no assurance that we will successfully maintain or launch these systems as planned or that they will be implemented without disruptions to our operations. IT system disruptions or failures, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, or failure to successfully implement new or upgraded systems, could disrupt our operations and therefore adversely affect our results of operations. While the uptime, performance, and security of our third party public cloud infrastructure providers are generally equal to or better than our own systems, as we continue to move to their platforms, our reliance on third parties means that any downtime or security issues they experience poses a greater risk of a single point of failure. Any failure by our third party providers could disrupt our operations and therefore adversely affect our results of operations.Risks Related to Operating a Global BusinessOur efforts to expand internationally may not be successful.Our current business strategies include pursuing selective international expansion in a number of countries around the world through a number of channels. This includes our franchisees opening additional stores internationally. We have limited experience operating or franchising in some of these locations. In many of these locations, we face major established competitors. In addition, in many of these locations, the real estate, employment and labor, transportation and logistics, regulatory, and other operating requirements differ dramatically from those in the places where we have more experience. Consumer tastes and trends may differ in many of these locations and, as a result, the sales of our products may not be successful or result in the margins we anticipate. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our results of operations could be adversely affected.Our franchise and licensing businesses are subject to certain risks not directly within our control that could impair the value of our brands.We have entered into franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate stores and websites in many countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores and websites that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. We have also entered into licensing agreements with unaffiliated licensees to sell products using our brand names. The effect of these arrangements on our business and results of operations is uncertain and will depend upon various factors, including the demand for our products in international markets, the demand for new product categories (such as our Gap Home collection at Walmart) and our ability to successfully identify appropriate third parties to act as franchisees, licensees, distributors, or in a similar capacity. In addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as franchisee and licensee financial stability and the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store locations, store openings, and sales. Other risks that may affect these third parties include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, foreign exchange rates, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and political instability. Moreover, while the franchise and licensing agreements we have entered into and plan to enter into in the future provide us with certain termination rights, the value of our brands could be impaired to the extent that these third parties do not operate their stores or websites or sell our branded products in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee or licensee, could adversely affect our results of operations and our reputation.17Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain.Trade restrictions, including more stringent tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States or other countries, including the likelihood, type, or effect of any such restrictions. For example, the current political landscape, including with respect to U.S.-China relations, and recent tariffs and bans imposed by the United States and other countries (such as the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act) has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to future tax and trade regulations. In addition, we face the possibility of anti-dumping or countervailing duties lawsuits from U.S. domestic producers. We are unable to determine the impact of the changes to the quota system or the impact that potential tariff lawsuits could have on our global sourcing operations. Our sourcing operations may be adversely affected by trade limits or political and financial instability, resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries, significant fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, restrictions on the transfer of funds, or other trade disruptions. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, such as the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Our business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and our hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks.We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, operating expenses, profits, assets, and liabilities generated or incurred in foreign currencies as well as inventory purchases in U.S. dollars for our foreign subsidiaries. Although we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in fully offsetting the negative impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally only delay the impact of adverse foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations.We experience fluctuations in our comparable sales and margins, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, our credit ratings and our liquidity.Our success depends in part on our ability to grow sales and improve margins. A variety of factors affect comparable sales and/or margins, including but not limited to apparel trends, competition, current economic conditions (including due to inflationary pressures, political instability or the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic),  the timing of new merchandise releases and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of our marketing programs (including our loyalty program), supply chain disruptions and transitory costs, foreign currency fluctuations, industry traffic trends, and weather conditions. These factors may cause our comparable sales results and margins to differ materially from prior periods and from financial market expectations. Our comparable sales, including the associated comparable online sales, have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual and quarterly basis. In fiscal 2021, our reported quarterly comparable sales have ranged from a high of 28 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 to a low of negative 1 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Over the past five fiscal years, our reported gross margins have ranged from a high of 39.8 percent in fiscal 2021 to a low of 34.1 percent in fiscal 2020. In addition, over the past five fiscal years, our reported operating margins have ranged from a high of 9.3 percent in fiscal 2017 to a low of negative 6.2 percent in fiscal 2020.Our ability to deliver strong comparable sales results and margins depends in large part on accurately forecasting demand and apparel trends, selecting effective marketing techniques, providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base, managing inventory effectively, using effective pricing strategies, and optimizing store performance. Fluctuations in our comparable sales and margins or failure to meet financial market expectations in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of our common stock, cause our credit ratings to decline, and negatively impact our liquidity.18Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, negative global climate patterns, or other catastrophic events.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, wildfires, and other extreme weather conditions; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics (including, for example, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic); political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, labor unrest, and other political instability; negative global climate patterns, especially in water stressed regions; or other catastrophic events or disasters occurring in or impacting the areas in which our stores, distribution centers, corporate offices or our vendors’ manufacturing facilities are located, whether occurring in the United States or internationally, could disrupt our, our franchisees' and our vendors' operations. Additionally, climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, and the physical changes prompted by climate change could result in increased regulation or changes in consumer preferences. While we consider these types of catastrophic events as part of our disaster recovery and business continuity planning, our planning may not be sufficient in all instances.In particular, these types of events could impact our supply chain from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability or the ability of our franchisees or other third parties to operate our stores or websites. These types of events could also negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or, depending upon the severity, globally. Disasters occurring at our vendors’ manufacturing facilities could impact our reputation and our customers’ perception of our brands. To the extent any of these events occur, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.In February 2022, in response to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the United States and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states, as well as non-member states, announced targeted economic sanctions on Russia, including certain Russian citizens and enterprises, and the continuation of the conflict may trigger additional economic and other sanctions. The potential impact of the conflict and any resulting bans, sanctions and boycotts on our business is uncertain at the current time due to the fluid nature of the conflict as it is unfolding. The potential impacts could include supply chain and logistics disruptions, macro financial impacts resulting from the exclusion of Russian financial institutions from the global banking system, volatility in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, inflationary pressures on raw materials and energy and heightened cybersecurity threats. We have a small franchise and distribution business in Russia and Ukraine. Although our operations in Russia and Ukraine are not significant, we do not and cannot know if the conflict, which is unfolding in real-time, could escalate and result in broader economic and security concerns which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.The market for real estate is competitive.Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices nationally and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics, and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases. In addition, we may seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition, relocate, or close some of our real estate locations, which in most cases requires a modification of an existing store lease. Since the beginning of fiscal 2020, in connection with our Power Plan strategy, we have closed hundreds of Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America. Failure to secure adequate new locations, successfully modify or exit existing locations, or effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, could adversely affect our results of operations.Additionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties within the United States and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options and renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.19We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims from time to time, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.As a multinational company, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims (“Actions”) arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these Actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, intellectual property, customer, employment, securities, and data privacy claims, including class action lawsuits. We are also currently party to Actions with certain landlords related to our decision to suspend rent payments earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of government and public health authority orders, mandates, guidelines and recommendations. The plaintiffs in some Actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages and some may be covered in part by insurance. We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of Actions brought against us. Additionally, defending against Actions may involve significant expense and diversion of management's attention and resources. Accordingly, developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and impact income in the quarter of such development, settlement, or resolution. An unfavorable outcome could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Risks Related to Governmental and Regulatory ChangesFailure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Laws and regulations at the local, state, federal, and international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. In addition, we cannot predict with assurance the impact that may result from changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape. While our policies are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, such laws and regulations are complex and often subject to differing interpretations, which can lead to unintentional or unknown instances of non-compliance.Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and any changes in laws or regulations, the imposition of additional laws or regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts employment and labor, anti-corruption, trade, product safety, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, cybersecurity, privacy, operations, or environmental issues, among others, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Risks Related to Our Credit Card ArrangementReductions in income and cash flow from our credit card arrangement related to our private label and co-branded credit cards could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.A third party, Synchrony Financial (“Synchrony”), currently owns and services our portfolios of private label credit card and co-branded programs for our Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta brands and another third party, Barclays PLC (""Barclays""), is expected to acquire those credit card portfolios during the second quarter of fiscal  2022. Our agreement with Synchrony provides for certain payments to be made by Synchrony to us, including a share of revenues from the performance of the credit card portfolios. The income and cash flow that we receive from Synchrony is dependent upon a number of factors, including the level of sales on private label and co-branded accounts, the level of balances carried on the accounts, payment rates on the accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on the accounts, the level of credit losses for the accounts, Synchrony’s ability to extend credit to our customers, as well as the cost of customer rewards programs. Our agreement with Barclays is expected to be largely similar to our current agreement with Synchrony. All of these factors can vary based on changes in federal and state credit card, banking, and commercial protection laws. The factors affecting the income and cash flow that we receive from our credit card arrangement can also vary based on a variety of economic, legal, social, and other factors (for example, the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) that we cannot control. If the income and cash flow that we receive from our credit card arrangement decreases significantly, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.20Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and Credit ProfileOn May 7, 2020, we entered into a third amended and restated senior secured asset-based revolving credit agreement (the ""ABL Facility"") in an initial aggregate principal amount of $1.8675 billion. On September 27, 2021, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.625 percent Senior Notes due 2029 (the ""2029 Senior Notes"") and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.875 percent Senior Notes due 2031 (the ""2031 Senior Notes"" and, with the 2029 Senior Notes, the ""Senior Notes""). We used the proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes and cash on hand to purchase or redeem all of our previously outstanding senior secured notes. As a result, we are subject to risks relating to our indebtedness, including the following risks.See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Form 10-K for disclosures on our debt and credit facilities.Our level of indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to operate and expand our business.We have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of January 29, 2022, the aggregate principal amount of our total outstanding indebtedness was $1.5 billion, all of which consisted of indebtedness under the Senior Notes. As of January 29, 2022, we had $1.8675 billion in principal amount of undrawn commitments available for additional borrowings under the ABL Facility, subject to borrowing base availability. On February 9, 2022, we borrowed $350 million under the ABL Facility and had $1.5175 billion in principal amount of undrawn commitments available for additional borrowings, subject to borrowing base availability.Our high level of indebtedness could impact our business in the following ways:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations, including with respect to the Senior Notes;•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and external conditions, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and inflationary pressures;•impair our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes;•require us to dedicate a material portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;•expose us to the risk of increased interest rates for borrowings under the ABL Facility, which bear interest at a variable rate;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;•place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; and•limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions.Any of these risks could impact our ability to operate and expand our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we may in the future incur additional indebtedness, which could intensify these risks and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and fund our working capital and capital expenditures, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.We are required to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flows from operations to the payment of interest and principal under our indebtedness. We generated net cash from operating activities of $809 million in fiscal 2021 and ended fiscal 2021 with $877 million of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet.21Our ability to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness depends upon our future operating performance and on our ability to generate cash flows in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, including the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our debt service obligations and other liquidity needs.If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investment and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity financing or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures (including due to restrictions in our indebtedness agreements), if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.If we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, we will be in default and, as a result, our lenders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, could terminate their commitments to loan money to us and could foreclose against any assets securing our indebtedness, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.Covenants in the ABL Facility may restrict our business and could limit our ability to implement our business plan.The ABL Facility includes covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to do the following under certain circumstances:•grant or incur liens;•sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;•make investments in certain subsidiaries;•pay dividends, make distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock; and•consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to another entity.Compliance with these and the other covenants in the ABL Facility may restrict our ability to implement our business plan, finance future operations, respond to changing business and economic conditions, secure additional financing, and engage in opportunistic transactions, such as strategic acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with our financial or other covenants under the ABL Facility or that any covenant violations would be waived in the future. Any violation that is not waived could result in an event of default and, as a result, our lenders under the ABL Facility could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, could suspend commitments to make any advances or could require any outstanding letters of credit to be collateralized by an interest bearing cash account, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the capital markets and adversely impact our business and financial condition.We currently have corporate credit ratings of BB with a positive outlook from Standard & Poor's and Ba2 with a positive outlook from Moody’s. Any reduction in our credit ratings could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets, more restrictive covenants in future financing documents and higher interest costs, and potentially increased lease or hedging costs. In addition, market conditions such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, including the recent volatility due, in part, to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing or refinance existing debt on terms that would be acceptable to us.22"
17,GPS,GAP INC,2021-03-16,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.Our past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance because actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties discussed below. In addition, historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Risks Related to Macroeconomic ConditionsThe novel coronavirus disease (or COVID-19) pandemic is expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. We expect the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and the success of vaccination efforts, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in response to government mandates or recommendations, as well as decisions we have made to protect the health and safety of our employees, consumers and communities, we temporarily closed a significant number of our stores globally and furloughed the majority of our store teams. We may face longer term store closure requirements and other operational restrictions with respect to some or all of our physical locations for prolonged periods of time due to, among other factors, evolving and increasingly stringent governmental restrictions including public health directives, quarantine policies or social distancing measures. In addition, many of our franchisees have closed many of their stores, which will adversely impact our revenues from these franchisees. As a result, we expect our financial results to continue to be materially adversely impacted.Further, consumer fears about becoming ill with the disease may continue, which will adversely affect traffic to our and our franchisees’ stores. Consumer spending generally may also be negatively impacted by general macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence, including the impacts of any recession, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This may negatively impact sales at our stores and our e-commerce channel and through our franchise agreements. Any significant reduction in consumer visits to, or spending at, our and our franchisees’ stores, caused by COVID-19, and any decreased spending at stores or online caused by decreased consumer confidence and spending following the pandemic, would result in a loss of sales and profits and other material adverse effects.The COVID-19 pandemic also has the potential to significantly impact our supply chain if the factories that manufacture our products, the distribution centers where we manage our inventory, or the operations of our logistics and other service providers are disrupted, temporarily closed or experience worker shortages. We may also see disruptions or delays in shipments and negative impacts to pricing of certain components of our products.As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including related governmental guidance or requirements, we also closed many of our corporate offices and other facilities, including our corporate headquarters in San Francisco, and have implemented a work from home policy for many of our corporate employees. This policy may negatively impact productivity and cause other disruptions to our business.If our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities, and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from borrowings under our credit facility or other sources, we may not be able to cover our expenses, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which would harm our business. Our insurance costs may also increase substantially in the future to cover the costs our insurance carriers may incur related to this pandemic.9In addition, in light of our store closures, the closures of many of the retail centers in which we operate, and federal, state and local instructions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are taking certain actions and may take additional actions with respect to many if not all of our existing leases during the COVID-19 pandemic, including negotiating with landlords for rent abatement, terminating certain leases, or discontinuing rent payment, which may subject us to legal, reputational and financial risks. We can provide no assurances that any forbearance of our lease obligations will be provided to us, nor that, following the COVID-19 pandemic, we will be able to recommence our store operations on the current terms of our existing leases, or at all.The full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our business and results of operations depends on future developments that are uncertain and unpredictable, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, its impact on capital and financial markets and any new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus, its spread to other regions as well as the actions taken to contain it, among others. At this point in time, we cannot reasonably estimate the full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our business and results of operations.We have suspended rent payments for our stores that have been closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could cause the counterparties under those leases to attempt to hold us in breach of our lease obligations and terminate our leases and accelerate our future rents due thereunder if we cannot reach acceptable settlements or otherwise prevail in litigation.As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in response to orders, mandates, guidelines and recommendations from governmental and public health authorities, we temporarily closed our North America retail stores and a significant number of our stores globally. Beginning in April 2020, we suspended rent payments under the leases for our temporarily closed stores. We are currently negotiating with the counterparties under those leases to defer or abate the applicable rent during the store closure period, to modify the terms (including rent) of our leases going forward after the stores reopen, or in certain instances to terminate the leases and permanently close some of the stores. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate rent deferrals or rent abatements, or terminate the leases, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to renegotiate the leases and continue to suspend rent payments, the landlords under a majority of the leases for our stores in the United States could allege that we are in default under the leases and attempt to terminate our lease and accelerate our future rents due thereunder. Although we believe that strong legal grounds exist to support our claim that we are not obligated to pay rent for the stores that have been closed because of the governmental and public health authority orders, mandates, guidelines and recommendations, there can be no assurance that such arguments will succeed and any dispute under these leases may result in litigation with the respective landlord, and any such dispute could be costly and have an uncertain outcome.Global economic conditions and any related impact on consumer spending patterns could adversely impact our results of operations.Our performance is subject to global economic conditions, as well as their impact on levels of consumer spending worldwide. Some of the factors that may influence consumer spending include high levels of unemployment, pandemics (such as the extent and duration of the ongoing impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced consumer demand, decreased sales, and widespread temporary store closures), higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on market declines and uncertainty, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, fluctuating interest and foreign currency rates and credit availability, government austerity measures, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty.Adverse economic changes in any of the regions in which we and our franchisees sell our products could reduce consumer confidence, and thereby could negatively affect earnings and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In challenging and uncertain economic environments, we cannot predict whether or when such circumstances may improve or worsen, or what impact, if any, such circumstances could have on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.10Risks Related to Our Brand Relevance and Brand ExecutionWe must successfully gauge apparel trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed.Our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our design and purchasing decisions may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing apparel trends or consumer acceptance of our products. The global apparel retail business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences, dictated in part by apparel trends and season. To the extent we misjudge the market for our merchandise or the products suitable for local markets, or fail to execute trends and deliver products to the market as timely as our competitors, our sales will be adversely affected, and the markdowns required to move the resulting excess inventory will adversely affect our operating results.We must maintain our reputation and brand image.Our brands have wide recognition, and our success has been due in large part to our ability to maintain, enhance and protect our brand image and reputation and our customers’ connection to our brands. Our continued success depends in part on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. Even if we react appropriately to negative posts or comments about us and/or our brands on social media and online, our customers’ perception of our brand image and our reputation could be negatively impacted. In addition, customer sentiment could be shaped by our sustainability policies and related design, sourcing and operations decisions. Failure to maintain, enhance and protect our brand image could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Risks Related to CompetitionOur business is highly competitive.The global apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We and our franchisees compete with local, national, and global department stores, specialty and discount store chains, independent retail stores, and online businesses that market similar lines of merchandise. We face a variety of competitive challenges in an increasingly complex and fast-paced environment, including:•anticipating and quickly responding to changing apparel trends and customer demands;•attracting customer traffic both in stores and online;•competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value;•maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to customers in several diverse market segments and geographic locations;•anticipating and responding to changing customer shopping preferences and practices, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement, social media communication, and online shopping;•developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to customers of varying age groups and tastes;•purchasing and stocking merchandise to match seasonal weather patterns, and our ability to react to shifts in weather that impact consumer demand;•sourcing and allocating merchandise efficiently; and•improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our processes in order to deliver cost savings to fund growth.If we or our franchisees are not able to compete successfully in the United States or internationally, our results of operations would be adversely affected.11Risks Related to Strategic Transactions and InvestmentsWe may engage in or seek to engage in strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and dispositions, that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which could disrupt or adversely affect our businesses.We may engage in or seek to engage in strategic transactions, such as acquisitions or dispositions, which we may not be able to complete on anticipated terms or time frames, or at all, or which may not generate some or all of the strategic, financial, operational or other benefits we expect to realize from such transactions on such anticipated time frames or at all. In addition, these transactions may be complex in nature, and unanticipated developments or changes, including changes in law, the macroeconomic environment, market conditions, the retail industry or political conditions may affect our ability to complete such transactions. In addition, the process of completing these transactions may be time-consuming and involve significant costs and expenses, which may be significantly higher than what we anticipate and may not yield a benefit if the transactions are not completed successfully, and executing these transactions may require significant time and attention from our senior management and employees, which could disrupt our ongoing business and adversely affect the financial results and results of operations. We may also experience increased difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating employees and/or attracting and retaining customers during the pendency or following the completion of any of these transactions, which could harm our businesses.In particular, in January 2020, we announced that we would no longer pursue our previously announced plan to separate into two independent publicly traded companies, and in October 2020 and March 2021, respectively, we shared that we are conducting strategic reviews of our European business and our Intermix business. We incurred significant costs and expenses in connection with our planned separation and may incur such expenses in connection with our strategic reviews, which require significant attention from our senior management and employees. We expect that the process of unwinding the separation-related work and executing any transactions resulting from the strategic reviews will be time-consuming, will involve additional costs and expenses, and may result in difficulties attracting, retaining and motivating employees, which could harm our business and adversely affect the financial results and results of operations.Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or the price of our common stock.Our investments in customer, digital, and omni-channel shopping initiatives may not deliver the results we anticipate.One of our strategic priorities is to further develop an omni-channel shopping experience for our customers through the integration of our store and digital shopping channels. Our omni-channel initiatives include cross-channel logistics optimization and exploring additional ways to develop an omni-channel shopping experience, including further digital integration and customer personalization. These initiatives involve significant investments in IT systems and significant operational changes. In addition, our competitors are also investing in omni-channel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives. If the implementation of our customer, digital, and omni-channel initiatives is not successful, or we do not realize the return on our investments in these initiatives that we anticipate, our operating results would be adversely affected.Risks Related to Human Capital, Inventory and Supply Chain ManagementOur failure to manage key executive succession and retention and to continue to attract qualified personnel could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing apparel trends depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel in our design, merchandising, sourcing, marketing, and other functions. In addition, several of our strategic initiatives, including our technology initiatives and supply chain initiatives, require that we hire and/or develop employees with appropriate experience. We must also attract, develop, and retain a sufficient number of qualified field and distribution center personnel. Competition for talent is intense and the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, and 12overtime regulations. If we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate talented employees with the appropriate skill sets, or if changes to our organizational structure, operating results, or business model adversely affect morale or retention, we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor to a key role could have a material adverse effect on our business. Since the beginning of fiscal 2019, there have been significant changes to our executive leadership team, including the departures of our Chief Executive Officer, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Gap brand and our Chief Financial Officer, and the appointment of a new Chief People Officer. In March 2020, we promoted Sonia Syngal to Chief Executive Officer and Katrina O’Connell to Chief Financial Officer. The effectiveness of our leaders, including our new Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and any further transition, could have a significant impact on our results of operations.If we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our gross margins could be adversely affected.Fluctuations in the global apparel retail markets impact the levels of inventory owned by apparel retailers. The nature of the global apparel retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to the peak holiday selling season when we build up our inventory levels. Merchandise usually must be ordered well in advance of the season and frequently before apparel trends are confirmed by customer purchases. We must enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. In the past, we have not always predicted our customers’ preferences and acceptance levels of our trend items with accuracy. If sales do not meet expectations (for example, because of the continuing and unknown aggregate duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on inventory supply and consumer demand), too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower-than-planned margins.We have key strategic initiatives designed to optimize our inventory levels and increase the efficiency and responsiveness of our supply chain, including vendor fabric platforming, product demand testing, and in-season rapid response to demand. We are also developing additional capabilities to analyze customer behavior and demand, which we believe will allow us to better localize assortment and improve store-level allocations, such as size allocation, to further tailor our assortments to customer needs and increase sell-through. Further, we intend to leverage technology and data science to digitize product creation, integrate with our consolidated vendor base, and further optimize our product-to-market processes and supply chain to enhance our in-season responsiveness and reduce our exposure to fashion volatility. These initiatives and additional capabilities involve significant changes to our inventory management systems and processes. If we are unable to implement these initiatives and integrate these additional capabilities successfully, we may not realize the return on our investments that we anticipate, and our operating results could be adversely affected.Our business is subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing.Independent third parties manufacture all of our products for us. As a result, we are directly impacted by increases in the cost of those products.If we experience significant increases in demand or need to replace an existing vendor, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or that any vendor would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, for any new manufacturing source, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our vendors in our methods, products, quality control standards, and environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. Moreover, in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the manufacture of our products could result in lower sales and net income. In addition, certain countries represent a larger portion of our global sourcing. For example, in fiscal 2019, approximately 32 percent and 16 percent of our merchandise, by dollar value, is purchased from factories in Vietnam and China, respectively. Accordingly, any delays in production and added costs in Vietnam or China could have a more significant impact on our results of operations.13Because independent vendors manufacture virtually all of our products outside of our principal sales markets, third parties must transport our products over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion, public health emergencies, social unrest, changes in local economic conditions, political upheavals, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with transitioning between vendors, could adversely impact our financial performance. Operating or manufacturing delays, transportation delays, or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as aircraft, which could adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, the cost of fuel is a significant component of transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our gross margins.If our vendors, or any raw material vendors on which our vendors rely, suffer prolonged manufacturing or transportation disruptions due to public health conditions, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, or other unforeseen events, our ability to source product could be adversely impacted which would adversely affect our results of operations.Risks associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries, including failure of our vendors to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct, could harm our business.We purchase nearly all merchandise from third-party vendors in many different countries, and we require those vendors to adhere to a Code of Vendor Conduct, which includes anti-corruption, environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. From time to time, contractors or their subcontractors may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable local laws. Although we have implemented policies and procedures to facilitate our compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise into various countries, there can be no assurance that suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more vendors could have a negative impact on our reputation, could subject us to liability, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Risks Related to Data Privacy and CybersecurityWe are subject to data and security risks, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and consumer confidence in our security measures.As part of our normal operations, we receive and maintain confidential, proprietary, and personally identifiable information, including credit card information, and information about our customers, our employees, job applicants, and other third parties. Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of this information. However, despite our safeguards and security processes and protections, security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. The retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. We may not have the resources to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our vendors or customers, or others who have entrusted us with information. In addition, even if we take appropriate measures to safeguard our information security and privacy environment from security breaches, we could still expose our customers and our business to risk. Actual or anticipated attacks may disrupt or impair our technology capabilities, and may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. Measures we implement to protect against cyber-attacks may also have the potential to impact our customers’ shopping experience or decrease activity on our websites by making them more difficult to use. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. In addition, the global regulatory environment surrounding information security, cybersecurity, and privacy is increasingly demanding, with new laws, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act, , the California Privacy Rights Act and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, each of which gives customers the right to control how their personal information is collected, used and retained. Violating these rights, or failing to secure personal information, could result in a violation of 14applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of consumer confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.Failures of, or updates or changes to, our IT systems may disrupt operations.We maintain a complex technology platform consisting of both legacy and modern systems, and we also rely on third-party providers for public cloud infrastructure that powers our e-commerce platform and other systems. Our owned and operated systems require continual maintenance, upgrades and changes, some of which are significant. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with maintaining and replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and addressing system disruptions and believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks through testing, training, and staging implementation, as well as ensuring appropriate commercial contracts are in place with third-party vendors supplying or supporting our IT initiatives. However, there can be no assurances that we will successfully maintain or launch these systems as planned or that they will be implemented without disruptions to our operations. IT system disruptions or failures, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, or failure to successfully implement new or upgraded systems, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Similarly, while the uptime, performance, and security of our third-party public cloud infrastructure providers are generally equal to or better than our own systems, our reliance on third parties means that any down-time or security issues experienced by our third-party providers poses a greater risk of a single point of failure as we continue to move to their platforms. Any of these failures by our third-party providers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Risks Related to Operating a Global BusinessOur efforts to expand internationally may not be successful.Our current strategies include pursuing selective international expansion in a number of countries around the world through a number of channels. This includes our franchisees opening additional stores internationally. We have limited experience operating or franchising in some of these locations. In many of these locations, we face major, established competitors. In addition, in many of these locations, the real estate, employment and labor, transportation and logistics, regulatory, and other operating requirements differ dramatically from those in the places where we have more experience. Consumer tastes and trends may differ in many of these locations and, as a result, the sales of our products may not be successful or result in the margins we anticipate. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our operations and financial results could be materially, adversely affected.The market for real estate is competitive.Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices nationally and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics, and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases. In addition, we may seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition, relocate, or close some of our real estate locations, which in most cases requires a modification of an existing store lease. For example, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we are in active negotiations with our landlords. Failure to secure adequate new locations, successfully modify or exit existing locations, or effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Additionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties within the United States and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and the quality of our decisions to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, or cause impairments of our lease right of use assets as market values decline, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.15Our franchise business is subject to certain risks not directly within our control that could impair the value of our brands.We enter into franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate stores and, in limited circumstances, websites, in many countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores and websites that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. The effect of these arrangements on our business and results of operations is uncertain and will depend upon various factors, including the demand for our products in new markets internationally and our ability to successfully identify appropriate third parties to act as franchisees, distributors, or in a similar capacity. In addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as franchisee financial stability and the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store locations, store openings, and sales. Other risks that may affect these third parties include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, foreign exchange rates, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and political instability. Moreover, while the agreements we have entered into and plan to enter into in the future provide us with certain termination rights, the value of our brands could be impaired to the extent that these third parties do not operate their stores in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain.Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States or other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type, or effect of any such restrictions. For example, the current political landscape and recent tariffs imposed by the U.S. and other countries in response has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to future tax and trade regulations. In addition, we face the possibility of anti-dumping or countervailing duties lawsuits from U.S. domestic producers. We are unable to determine the impact of the changes to the quota system or the impact that potential tariff lawsuits could have on our global sourcing operations. Our sourcing operations may be adversely affected by trade limits or political and financial instability, resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries, significant fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, restrictions on the transfer of funds, or other trade disruptions. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, such as the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Our business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and our hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks.We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, operating expenses, profits, assets, and liabilities generated or incurred in foreign currencies as well as inventory purchases in U.S. dollars for our foreign subsidiaries. Although we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in fully offsetting the negative impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally only delay the impact of adverse foreign currency rate movements on our business and financial results.We experience fluctuations in our comparable sales and margins.Our success depends in part on our ability to grow sales and improve margins, in particular at our largest brands. A variety of factors affect comparable sales or margins, including but not limited to apparel trends, competition, current economic conditions, the timing of new merchandise releases and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs, foreign currency fluctuations, industry traffic trends, and weather conditions. These factors may cause our comparable sales results and margins to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations. Our comparable sales, including the associated comparable online sales, have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual and quarterly basis. As a result of the extensive temporary store closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, comparable sales are not a meaningful metric for the thirteen 16weeks ended May 2, 2020. For the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020, our reported quarterly comparable sales have ranged from a high of 13 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 to a low of 0 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Over the past five fiscal years, our reported gross margins have ranged from a high of 38 percent in fiscal 2017 to a low of 34 percent in fiscal 2020. In addition, over the past five fiscal years, our reported operating margins have ranged from a high of 9 percent in fiscal 2017 to a low of negative 6 percent in fiscal 2020.Our ability to deliver strong comparable sales results and margins depends in large part on accurately forecasting demand and apparel trends, selecting effective marketing techniques, providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base, managing inventory effectively, using effective pricing strategies, and optimizing store performance. Failure to meet the expectations of investors, securities analysts, or credit rating agencies in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of our common stock, cause our credit ratings to decline, and impact liquidity.Our results could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, negative global climate patterns, or other catastrophic events.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, and other adverse weather conditions; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics (including, for example, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic); political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, labor unrest, and other political instability; negative global climate patterns, especially in water stressed regions; or other catastrophic events, such as fires or other disasters occurring at our distribution centers or our vendors’ manufacturing facilities, whether occurring in the United States or internationally, could disrupt our operations, including the operations of our franchisees or the operations of one or more of our vendors. In particular, these types of events could impact our supply chain from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability or the ability of our franchisees or other third parties to operate our stores or websites. These types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or, depending upon the severity, globally. For example, social distancing measures imposed by governments and related store closures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic have had and are expected to continue to have a material adverse impact on our store revenue. Disasters occurring at our vendors’ manufacturing facilities could impact our reputation and our customers’ perception of our brands. To the extent any of these events occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims from time to time, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.As a multinational company, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims (“Actions”) arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these Actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, intellectual property, customer, employment, and data privacy claims, including class action lawsuits. The plaintiffs in some Actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages and some are covered in part by insurance. We may face additional Actions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including Actions filed by our landlords in respect of our leases. We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of Actions brought against us. Accordingly, developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and impact income in the quarter of such development, settlement, or resolution. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Risks Related to Governmental and Regulatory ChangesChanges in the regulatory or administrative landscape could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Laws and regulations at the local, state, federal, and international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that may result from changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape.Any changes in laws or regulations, the imposition of additional laws or regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts employment and labor, anti-corruption, trade, product safety, 17transportation and logistics, health care, tax, cybersecurity, privacy, operations, or environmental issues, among others, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.18Risks Related to Our Credit Card ArrangementReductions in income and cash flow from our credit card arrangement related to our private label and co-branded credit cards could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.A third-party, Synchrony Financial (“Synchrony”), owns and services our private label credit card and co-branded programs for our Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta brands. Our agreement with Synchrony provides for certain payments to be made by Synchrony to us, including a share of revenues from the performance of the credit card portfolios. The income and cash flow that we receive from Synchrony is dependent upon a number of factors, including the level of sales on private label and co-branded accounts, the level of balances carried on the accounts, payment rates on the accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on the accounts, the level of credit losses for the accounts, Synchrony’s ability to extend credit to our customers, as well as the cost of customer rewards programs. All of these factors can vary based on changes in federal and state credit card, banking, and commercial protection laws. The factors affecting the income and cash flow that we receive from Synchrony can also vary based on a variety of economic, legal, social, and other factors (for example, the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic) that we cannot control. If the income and cash flow that we receive from the consumer credit card program agreement with Synchrony decreases significantly, our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.Risks Relating to Our Credit Profile, Indebtedness and the NotesOn May 7, 2020, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 8.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 (the ""2023 Notes""), $750 million aggregate principal amount of 8.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the ""2025 Notes"") and $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 8.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (the ""2027 Notes"" and, with the 2023 Notes and the 2025 Notes, the ""notes"").  Concurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into a third amended and restated senior secured asset-based revolving credit agreement providing for an asset-based facility (the ""ABL Credit Facility"") in an initial aggregate principal amount of $1.8675 billion.  As a result, we are subject to risks relating to our indebtedness and the notes, including the following risks.Changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the capital markets and adversely impact our financial position or our business initiatives.As a result of the issuance of the notes, we have additional costs that include interest payable semi-annually on the notes.Our cash flows from operations are the primary source of funds for these debt service payments. In this regard, we have generated annual cash flow from operating activities in excess of $1 billion per year for well over a decade and ended fiscal 2020 with $2.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents, as defined above, on our balance sheet. We are also able to supplement near-term liquidity, if needed, with our ABL Credit Facility (as defined below under ""Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes""), which we entered into in May 2020 and which has an initial aggregate principal amount of $1.8675 billion in undrawn commitments. We continue to target a minimum cash balance between $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion, which provides not only for our working capital needs, but also a reserve for unexpected business downturns. For example, our cash flows from operating activities  declined significantly in the first half of fiscal year 2020, largely due to reduced store traffic and widespread temporary store closures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, any future reduction in our credit ratings could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets, and higher interest costs and potentially increased lease or hedging costs. Reduction in our credit ratings could also negatively impact our ability to enter into new debt arrangements in the future.In April 2020 following the announcement of the pending issuance of the notes, Standard and Poor’s Ratings Service downgraded their credit rating of us from BB to BB- with negative outlook and Moody’s Investor Service downgraded their corporate credit rating of us from to Ba1 to Ba2 with negative outlook. These downgrades, and any future reduction in our credit ratings, could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets, more restrictive covenants in future financial documents and higher interest costs, and potentially increased lease or hedging costs.19See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Form 10-K for disclosures on debt and credit facilities.Our level of indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants, react to changes in our business or the industry in which we operate, or prevent us from making payments on our indebtedness, including the notes.We have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of January 30, 2021, the aggregate principal amount of our total outstanding indebtedness was $2.250 million, all of which consisted of secured indebtedness under the notes. In addition, we had an additional $1.8675 million in principal amount of undrawn commitments available for additional borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility, subject to borrowing base availability.Our high level of indebtedness could have important consequences for the holders of our common stock and the holders of our notes. For example, it could:•make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations, including with respect to the notes;•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and external conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic;•impair our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes;•require us to dedicate a material portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;•expose us to the risk of increased interest rates to the extent we make borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility, which bear interest at a variable rate;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;•place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; and•limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions.If we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the notes and the guarantees of the notes, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with such holders in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of us or a guarantor, subject to any collateral arrangements. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to the holders of the notes. In addition, any other indebtedness secured by the collateral would reduce the value of the rights of holders of the notes to the collateral.Any of these risks could materially impact our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Despite our level of indebtedness, we may incur additional indebtedness, which could further increase the risks associated with our leverage.We and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, which may include financing relating to physical and digital retail assets, potential acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances, working capital, capital expenditures or general corporate purposes. In addition, the ABL Credit Facility and the indenture governing the notes permit us, subject to specified limitations, to incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness.  If new indebtedness is added to our level of indebtedness, the related risks that we would face could intensify and our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to these notes could be adversely affected.We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, including the notes, and fund our working capital and capital expenditures, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.20Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the notes, depends upon our future operating performance and on our ability to generate cash flow in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, including the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings, including borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility, will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investment and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the notes. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The ABL Credit Facility and the indenture governing the notes restrict, our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition, and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to repay or service our indebtedness.If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result, the lenders under our ABL Credit Facility and the holders of certain current and future indebtedness (including the notes) could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the ABL Credit Facility could terminate their commitments to loan money and foreclose against the assets securing the borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which could result in holders losing their investment in our common stock and the notes.Covenants in our debt agreements restrict our business and could limit our ability to implement our business plan.The ABL Credit Facility and the indenture governing the notes contain incurrence covenants that may restrict our ability to implement our business plan, finance future operations, respond to changing business and economic conditions, secure additional financing, and engage in opportunistic transactions, such as strategic acquisitions. In addition, if we fail to satisfy the covenants contained in the ABL Credit Facility, our ability to borrow under the ABL Credit Facility may be restricted. The ABL Credit Facility and the indenture governing the notes include, covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to do the following under certain circumstances:•grant or incur liens;•sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;•make investments in certain subsidiaries;•pay dividends, make distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock; and•consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to another entity.The ABL Credit Facility limits our strategic flexibility, as discussed above, if we are not in compliance with certain financial covenants, including a minimum annual fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum annual leverage ratio.If we default under the ABL Credit Facility, or the indenture governing the notes, because of a covenant breach or otherwise, all outstanding amounts thereunder could become immediately due and payable. We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with our financial or other covenants under the ABL Credit Facility, or the indenture governing the notes or that any covenant violations will be waived in the future. Any violation that is not waived could result in an event of default, permitting our lenders to declare outstanding indebtedness and interest thereon due and payable, and permitting the lenders under the ABL Credit Facility to suspend commitments to make any advance or, with respect to the ABL Credit Facility, require any outstanding letters of credit to be collateralized by an interest bearing cash account, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we fail to comply with our financial or other covenants under the ABL Credit Facility, or the indenture governing the notes, we may need additional financing in order to service or extinguish our indebtedness. We may not be able to obtain financing or refinancing on terms 21acceptable to us, if at all. We cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds to repay all the outstanding amounts under the proposed ABL Credit Facility or the indenture governing the notes, and any acceleration of amounts due would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control.Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding notes (including the notes offered hereby) at 101% of the principal amount of such notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. Certain change of control events would also constitute an event of default under the ABL Credit Facility. Therefore, upon the occurrence of a change of control, the lenders under the ABL Credit Facility may have the right, among other things, to terminate their lending commitments or to cause all outstanding debt obligations under the ABL Credit Facility to become due and payable and proceed against the assets securing such debt, any of which would prevent us from borrowing under the ABL Credit Facility to finance a repurchase of the notes. We cannot assure you that we will have available funds sufficient to repurchase the notes and satisfy other payment obligations that could be triggered upon the change of control. If we do not have sufficient financial resources to effect a change of control offer, we would be required to seek additional financing from outside sources to repurchase the notes. We cannot assure you that financing would be available to us on satisfactory terms, or at all. In addition, certain important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a ""Change of Control"" under the indenture governing the notes"
10,GPS,GAP INC,2020-03-17,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.Our past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance because actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties discussed below. In addition, historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.We must successfully gauge apparel trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed.Our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our design and purchasing decisions may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing apparel trends or consumer acceptance of our products. The global apparel retail business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences, dictated in part by apparel trends and season. To the extent we misjudge the market for our merchandise or the products suitable for local markets, or fail to execute trends and deliver products to the market as timely as our competitors, our sales will be adversely affected, and the markdowns required to move the resulting excess inventory will adversely affect our operating results. Our business is highly competitive.The global apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We and our franchisees compete with local, national, and global department stores, specialty and discount store chains, independent retail stores, and online businesses that market similar lines of merchandise. We face a variety of competitive challenges in an increasingly complex and fast-paced environment, including:•anticipating and quickly responding to changing apparel trends and customer demands;•attracting customer traffic both in stores and online;•competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value;•maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to customers in several diverse market segments and geographic locations;•anticipating and responding to changing customer shopping preferences and practices, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement, social media communication, and online shopping;•developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to customers of varying age groups and tastes; •purchasing and stocking merchandise to match seasonal weather patterns, and our ability to react to shifts in weather that impact consumer demand; •sourcing and allocating merchandise efficiently; and•improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our processes in order to deliver cost savings to fund growth.If we or our franchisees are not able to compete successfully in the United States or internationally, our results of operations would be adversely affected.Global economic conditions and any related impact on consumer spending patterns could adversely impact our results of operations.Our performance is subject to global economic conditions, as well as their impact on levels of consumer spending worldwide. Some of the factors that may influence consumer spending include high levels of unemployment, pandemics (such as the impact of the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, including reduced store traffic and widespread temporary store closures), higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on market declines and uncertainty, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, fluctuating interest and foreign currency rates and credit availability, government austerity measures, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty.6Adverse economic changes in any of the regions in which we and our franchisees sell our products could reduce consumer confidence, and thereby could negatively affect earnings and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In challenging and uncertain economic environments, we cannot predict whether or when such circumstances may improve or worsen, or what impact, if any, such circumstances could have on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.We may engage in or seek to engage in strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and dispositions, that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which could disrupt or adversely affect our businesses.We may engage in or seek to engage in strategic transactions, such as acquisitions or dispositions, which we may not be able to complete on anticipated terms or time frames, or at all, or which may not generate some or all of the strategic, financial, operational or other benefits we expect to realize from such transactions on such anticipated time frames or at all.  In addition, these transactions may be complex in nature, and unanticipated developments or changes, including changes in law, the macroeconomic environment, market conditions, the retail industry or political conditions may affect our ability to complete such transactions.  In addition, the process of completing these transactions may be time-consuming and involve significant costs and expenses, which may be significantly higher than what we anticipate and may not yield a benefit if the transactions are not completed successfully, and executing these transactions may require significant time and attention from our senior management and employees, which could disrupt our ongoing business and adversely affect the financial results and results of operations.  We may also experience increased difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating employees and/or attracting and retaining customers during the pendency or following the completion of any of these transactions, which could harm our businesses.  In particular, on January 16, 2020, we announced that we would no longer pursue our previously announced plan to separate into two independent publicly traded companies.  We incurred significant costs and expenses in connection with our planned separation, which required significant attention from our senior management and employees, and we expect that the process of unwinding the separation-related work will be time-consuming, will involve additional costs and expenses, and may result in difficulties attracting, retaining and motivating employees, which could harm our business and adversely affect the financial results and results of operations.  Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or the price of our common stock.We must maintain our reputation and brand image.Our brands have wide recognition, and our success has been due in large part to our ability to maintain, enhance and protect our brand image and reputation and our customers’ connection to our brands. Our continued success depends in part on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. Even if we react appropriately to negative posts or comments about us and/or our brands on social media and online, our customers’ perception of our brand image and our reputation could be negatively impacted. In addition, customer sentiment could be shaped by our sustainability policies and related design, sourcing and operations decisions. Failure to maintain, enhance and protect our brand image could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Our failure to manage key executive succession and retention and to continue to attract qualified personnel could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing apparel trends depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel in our design, merchandising, sourcing, marketing, and other functions. In addition, several of our strategic initiatives, including our technology initiatives and supply chain initiatives, require that we hire and/or develop employees with appropriate experience. We must also attract, develop, and retain a sufficient number of qualified field and distribution center personnel. Competition for talent is intense and the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, and overtime regulations. If we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate talented employees with the appropriate skill sets, or if changes to our organizational structure, operating results, or business model adversely affect morale or 7retention, we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor to a key role could have a material adverse effect on our business. Since the beginning of fiscal 2019, there have been significant changes to our executive leadership team, including the departures of our Chief Executive Officer and our President and Chief Executive Officer of Gap brand and the upcoming departure of our Chief Financial Officer, and the appointment of a new Chief People Officer. In March 2020, we promoted Sonia Syngal to Chief Executive Officer and Katrina O'Connell to Chief Financial Officer. The effectiveness of our leaders, including our new Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and any further transition, could have a significant impact on our results of operations.Our investments in customer, digital, and omni-channel shopping initiatives may not deliver the results we anticipate.One of our strategic priorities is to further develop an omni-channel shopping experience for our customers through the integration of our store and digital shopping channels. Our omni-channel initiatives include cross-channel logistics optimization and exploring additional ways to develop an omni-channel shopping experience, including further digital integration and customer personalization. These initiatives involve significant investments in IT systems and significant operational changes. In addition, our competitors are also investing in omni-channel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives. If the implementation of our customer, digital, and omni-channel initiatives is not successful, or we do not realize the return on our investments in these initiatives that we anticipate, our operating results would be adversely affected.If we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our gross margins could be adversely affected.Fluctuations in the global apparel retail markets impact the levels of inventory owned by apparel retailers. The nature of the global apparel retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to the peak holiday selling season when we build up our inventory levels. Merchandise usually must be ordered well in advance of the season and frequently before apparel trends are confirmed by customer purchases. We must enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. In the past, we have not always predicted our customers’ preferences and acceptance levels of our trend items with accuracy. If sales do not meet expectations (for example, because of unexpected effects on inventory supply and consumer demand caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic), too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower-than-planned margins.We have key strategic initiatives designed to optimize our inventory levels and increase the efficiency and responsiveness of our supply chain, including vendor fabric platforming, product demand testing, and in-season rapid response to demand. We are also developing additional capabilities to analyze customer behavior and demand, which we believe will allow us to better localize assortment and improve store-level allocations, such as size allocation, to further tailor our assortments to customer needs and increase sell-through. Further, we intend to leverage technology and data science to digitize product creation, integrate with our consolidated vendor base, and further optimize our product-to-market processes and supply chain to enhance our in-season responsiveness and reduce our exposure to fashion volatility. These initiatives and additional capabilities involve significant changes to our inventory management systems and processes. If we are unable to implement these initiatives and integrate these additional capabilities successfully, we may not realize the return on our investments that we anticipate, and our operating results could be adversely affected.Our business is subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing.Independent third parties manufacture all of our products for us. As a result, we are directly impacted by increases in the cost of those products.If we experience significant increases in demand or need to replace an existing vendor, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or that any vendor would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, for any new manufacturing source, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our vendors in our methods, products, quality control standards, and environmental, labor, health, 8and safety standards. Moreover, in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the manufacture of our products could result in lower sales and net income. In addition, certain countries represent a larger portion of our global sourcing. For example, in fiscal 2019, approximately 32 percent and 16 percent of our merchandise, by dollar value, is purchased from factories in Vietnam and China, respectively. Accordingly, any delays in production and added costs in Vietnam or China could have a more significant impact on our results of operations.Because independent vendors manufacture virtually all of our products outside of our principal sales markets, third parties must transport our products over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion, public health emergencies, social unrest, changes in local economic conditions, political upheavals, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with transitioning between vendors, could adversely impact our financial performance. Operating or manufacturing delays, transportation delays, or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as aircraft, which could adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, the cost of fuel is a significant component of transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our gross margins.If our vendors, or any raw material vendors on which our vendors rely, suffer prolonged manufacturing or transportation disruptions due to public health conditions, such as the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, or other unforeseen events, our ability to source product could be adversely impacted which would adversely affect our results of operations.We are subject to data and security risks, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and consumer confidence in our security measures.As part of our normal operations, we receive and maintain confidential, proprietary, and personally identifiable information, including credit card information, and information about our customers, our employees, job applicants, and other third parties. Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of this information. However, despite our safeguards and security processes and protections, security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. The retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. We may not have the resources to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our vendors or customers, or others who have entrusted us with information. In addition, even if we take appropriate measures to safeguard our information security and privacy environment from security breaches, we could still expose our customers and our business to risk. Actual or anticipated attacks may disrupt or impair our technology capabilities, and may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. Measures we implement to protect against cyber attacks may also have the potential to impact our customers’ shopping experience or decrease activity on our websites by making them more difficult to use. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. In addition, the global regulatory environment surrounding information security, cybersecurity, and privacy is increasingly demanding, with new laws, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which give customers the right to control how their personal information is collected, used and retained. Violating these rights, or failing to secure personal information, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of consumer confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.9Failures of, or updates or changes to, our IT systems may disrupt operations.We maintain a complex technology platform consisting of both legacy and modern systems. These systems require continual maintenance, upgrades and changes, some of which are significant. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with maintaining and replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and addressing system disruptions and believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks through testing, training, and staging implementation, as well as ensuring appropriate commercial contracts are in place with third-party vendors supplying or supporting our IT initiatives. However, there can be no assurances that we will successfully maintain or launch these systems as planned or that they will be implemented without disruptions to our operations. IT system disruptions or failures, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, or failure to successfully implement new or upgraded systems, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful.Our current strategies include pursuing selective international expansion in a number of countries around the world through a number of channels. This includes our franchisees opening additional stores internationally. We have limited experience operating or franchising in some of these locations. In many of these locations, we face major, established competitors. In addition, in many of these locations, the real estate, employment and labor, transportation and logistics, regulatory, and other operating requirements differ dramatically from those in the places where we have more experience. Consumer tastes and trends may differ in many of these locations and, as a result, the sales of our products may not be successful or result in the margins we anticipate. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our operations and financial results could be materially, adversely affected.The market for real estate is competitive.Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices nationally and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics, and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases. In addition, we may seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition, relocate, or close some of our real estate locations, which in most cases requires a modification of an existing store lease. For example, on February 28, 2019, we announced plans to restructure our fleet of specialty stores and revitalize the Gap brand, including closing about 230 specialty stores during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. Failure to secure adequate new locations, successfully modify or exit existing locations, or effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Additionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties within the United States and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and the quality of our decisions to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, or cause impairments of our lease right of use assets as market values decline, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Risks associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries, including failure of our vendors to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct, could harm our business.We purchase nearly all merchandise from third-party vendors in many different countries, and we require those vendors to adhere to a Code of Vendor Conduct, which includes environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. From time to time, contractors or their subcontractors may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable local laws. Although we have implemented policies and procedures to facilitate our compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise into various countries, there can be no assurance that suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards 10and laws by one or more vendors could have a negative impact on our reputation, could subject us to liability, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Our franchise business is subject to certain risks not directly within our control that could impair the value of our brands.We enter into franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate stores and, in limited circumstances, websites, in many countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores and websites that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. The effect of these arrangements on our business and results of operations is uncertain and will depend upon various factors, including the demand for our products in new markets internationally and our ability to successfully identify appropriate third parties to act as franchisees, distributors, or in a similar capacity. In addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as franchisee financial stability and the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store locations, store openings, and sales. Other risks that may affect these third parties include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, foreign exchange rates, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and political instability. Moreover, while the agreements we have entered into and plan to enter into in the future provide us with certain termination rights, the value of our brands could be impaired to the extent that these third parties do not operate their stores in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain.Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States or other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type, or effect of any such restrictions. For example, the current political landscape and recent tariffs imposed by the U.S. and other countries in response has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to future tax and trade regulations. In addition, we face the possibility of anti-dumping or countervailing duties lawsuits from U.S. domestic producers. We are unable to determine the impact of the changes to the quota system or the impact that potential tariff lawsuits could have on our global sourcing operations. Our sourcing operations may be adversely affected by trade limits or political and financial instability, resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries, significant fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, restrictions on the transfer of funds, or other trade disruptions. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, such as the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Our business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and our hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks.We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, operating expenses, profits, assets, and liabilities generated or incurred in foreign currencies as well as inventory purchases in U.S. dollars for our foreign subsidiaries. Although we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in fully offsetting the negative impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally only delay the impact of adverse foreign currency rate movements on our business and financial results. We experience fluctuations in our comparable sales and margins.Our success depends in part on our ability to grow sales and improve margins, in particular at our largest brands. A variety of factors affect comparable sales or margins, including but not limited to apparel trends, competition, current economic conditions, the timing of new merchandise releases and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs, foreign currency fluctuations, industry traffic trends, and weather conditions. These factors may cause our comparable sales results and margins to differ materially from 11prior periods and from expectations. Our comparable sales, including the associated comparable online sales, have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual and quarterly basis. Over the past fiscal year, our reported quarterly comparable sales have ranged from a high of negative 1 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 to a low of negative 4 percent in the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2019. Over the past five years, our reported gross margins have ranged from a high of 38.3 percent in fiscal 2017 to a low of 36.2 percent in fiscal 2015. In addition, over the past five years, our reported operating margins have ranged from a high of 9.6 percent in fiscal 2015 to a low of 3.5 percent in fiscal 2019.Our ability to deliver strong comparable sales results and margins depends in large part on accurately forecasting demand and apparel trends, selecting effective marketing techniques, providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base, managing inventory effectively, using effective pricing strategies, and optimizing store performance. Failure to meet the expectations of investors, securities analysts, or credit rating agencies in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of our common stock, cause our credit ratings to decline, and impact liquidity.Changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the capital markets and adversely impact our financial position or our business initiatives.In April 2011, we issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.95 percent notes due April 2021. As a result, we have additional costs that include interest payable semi-annually on the notes.Our cash flows from operations are the primary source of funds for these debt service payments. In this regard, we have generated annual cash flow from operating activities in excess of $1 billion per year for well over a decade and ended fiscal 2019 with $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. We are also able to supplement near-term liquidity, if necessary, with our $500 million revolving credit facility. We continue to target a cash balance between $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion, which provides not only for our working capital needs, but also a reserve for unexpected business downturns. However, if our cash flows from operating activities decline significantly, including any such decline related to reduced store traffic and widespread temporary store closures as a result of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, we may be required to reprioritize our business initiatives to ensure that we can continue to service or refinance our debt with favorable rates and terms. In addition, any future reduction in our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets, and higher interest costs and potentially increased lease or hedging costs. Reduction in our credit ratings could also negatively impact our ability to extinguish our Notes and enter into a new long-term debt arrangement.In November 2019, Standard and Poor’s Ratings Service downgraded their credit rating of us from BB+ stable outlook to BB negative outlook. This downgrade, and any future reduction in our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings, could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets, more restrictive covenants in future financial documents and higher interest costs, and potentially increased lease or hedging costs.For further information on our debt and credit facilities, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 5 and Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.Changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Laws and regulations at the local, state, federal, and international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that may result from changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape.Any changes in laws or regulations, the imposition of additional laws or regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts employment and labor, trade, product safety, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, cybersecurity, privacy, operations, or environmental issues, among others, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.12Our results could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, negative global climate patterns, or other catastrophic events.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, and other adverse weather conditions; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics (including, for example, the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic); political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, labor unrest, and other political instability; negative global climate patterns, especially in water stressed regions; or other catastrophic events, such as fires or other disasters occurring at our distribution centers or our vendors' manufacturing facilities, whether occurring in the United States or internationally, could disrupt our operations, including the operations of our franchisees or the operations of one or more of our vendors. In particular, these types of events could impact our supply chain from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability or the ability of our franchisees or other third parties to operate our stores or websites. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to significantly impact our supply chain if the factories that manufacture our products are temporarily closed or experience worker shortages. In addition, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or, depending upon the severity, globally. For example, if customers’ concerns over potential exposure to COVID-19 or social distancing measures imposed by governments cause customers to avoid shopping centers and other retail locations, our store revenue could be adversely impacted. Disasters occurring at our vendors’ manufacturing facilities could impact our reputation and our customers’ perception of our brands. To the extent any of these events occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.Reductions in income and cash flow from our credit card arrangement related to our private label and co-branded credit cards could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. A third-party, Synchrony Financial (""Synchrony""), owns and services our private label credit card and co-branded programs for our Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta brands. Our agreement with Synchrony provides for certain payments to be made by Synchrony to us, including a share of revenues from the performance of the credit card portfolios. The income and cash flow that we receive from Synchrony is dependent upon a number of factors, including the level of sales on private label and co-branded accounts, the level of balances carried on the accounts, payment rates on the accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on the accounts, the level of credit losses for the accounts, Synchrony’s ability to extend credit to our customers, as well as the cost of customer rewards programs. All of these factors can vary based on changes in federal and state credit card, banking, and commercial protection laws. The factors affecting the income and cash flow that we receive from Synchrony can also vary based on a variety of economic, legal, social, and other factors that we cannot control. If the income and cash flow that we receive from the consumer credit card program agreement with Synchrony decreases significantly, our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims from time to time, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.As a multinational company, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims (“Actions”) arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these Actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, intellectual property, customer, employment, and data privacy claims, including class action lawsuits. The plaintiffs in some Actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages and some are covered in part by insurance. We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of Actions brought against us. Accordingly, developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and impact income in the quarter of such development, settlement, or resolution. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations"
4,GPS,GAP INC,2019-03-19,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
. Our past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance because actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties discussed below. In addition, historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.Our plan to separate into two independent publicly-traded companies is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated timeline, or at all, and will involve significant time and expense, which could disrupt or adversely affect our businesses.On February 28, 2019, we announced our intention to separate into two independent publicly-traded companies:  Old Navy and a yet-to-be-named company (“NewCo”), which will consist of the Gap brand, Athleta, Banana Republic, Intermix and Hill City.  We expect to effect the separation through a spin-off that is intended to generally be tax-free to the Company’s shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  The transaction is currently targeted to be completed in 2020 and is subject to certain conditions, including final approval by our Board of Directors, receipt of a tax opinion from counsel, and the filing and effectiveness of a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the separation for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all, and there can be no assurances regarding the ultimate timing or terms of the separation or that the separation will be completed.  In addition, the separation is complex in nature, and unanticipated developments or changes, including changes in law, the macroeconomic environment, market conditions, the retail industry or political conditions may affect our ability to complete the transaction as currently expected, within the anticipated time frame or at all.  Any changes to the transaction or delay in completing the transaction could cause us not to realize some or all of the expected benefits, or realize them on a different timeline than expected.  In addition, although we intend for the separation to generally be tax-free to the Company’s shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there can be no assurance that the transaction will so qualify.  If the separation were ultimately determined to be taxable, the Company, the Company’s shareholders and/or the new independent companies could incur income tax liabilities and/or indemnity obligations that could be significant.We expect that the process of completing the separation will be time-consuming and involve significant costs and expenses, which may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate and may not yield a benefit if the separation is not completed.  Executing the separation will require significant time and attention from our senior management and employees, which could disrupt our ongoing business and adversely affect the financial results and results of operations.  We may also experience increased difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating employees and/or attracting and retaining customers during the pendency of the separation and following its completion, which could harm our businesses. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or the price of our common stock.The separation may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits.We may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational or other benefits from the separation, and there is no assurance that following the separation, each separate company will be successful.  As independent publicly-traded companies, Old Navy and NewCo will be smaller, less diversified companies and may be more vulnerable to changing conditions in the retail industry or changes in market conditions, which could materially adversely affect their respective businesses, financial conditions, results of operations.  For example, Old Navy will no longer be part of a company that also includes a number of other specialty brands, and the NewCo businesses will no longer be part of a company that also operates Old Navy as a fast-growing brand that is a category leader in family apparel.  These factors could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or the price of the common stock of Old Navy and/or NewCo. 6In addition, investors holding our common stock prior to the separation may hold our common stock because of a decision to invest in a company that operates both our Old Navy and specialty brands.  If the separation transaction is completed, shares of common stock in each independent company held by those investors will represent an investment in a company with a different profile than that of Gap, and, as a result, some investors may sell our common stock prior to the separation or sell the common stock of one or both independent companies resulting from the separation.  Further, there can be no assurance that the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly traded companies resulting from the separation will be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the separation not occurred.We must successfully gauge apparel trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed.Our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our design and purchasing decisions may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing apparel trends or consumer acceptance of our products. The global apparel retail business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences, dictated in part by apparel trends and season. To the extent we misjudge the market for our merchandise or the products suitable for local markets or fail to execute trends and deliver product to market as timely as our competitors, our sales will be adversely affected, and the markdowns required to move the resulting excess inventory will adversely affect our operating results. Our business is highly competitive.The global apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We and our franchisees compete with local, national, and global department stores, specialty and discount store chains, independent retail stores, and online businesses that market similar lines of merchandise. We face a variety of competitive challenges in an increasingly complex and fast-paced environment, including:•anticipating and quickly responding to changing apparel trends and customer demands;•attracting customer traffic both in stores and online;•competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value;•maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to customers in several diverse market segments and geographic locations;•anticipating and responding to changing customer shopping preferences and practices, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement, social media communication, and online shopping;•developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to customers of varying age groups and tastes; •purchasing and stocking merchandise to match seasonal weather patterns, and our ability to react to shifts in weather that impact consumer demand; •sourcing and allocating merchandise efficiently; and•improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our processes in order to deliver cost savings to fund growth.If we or our franchisees are not able to compete successfully in the United States or internationally, our results of operations would be adversely affected.We must maintain our reputation and brand image.Our brands have wide recognition, and our success has been due in large part to our ability to maintain, enhance and protect our brand image and reputation and our customers’ connection to our brands. Our continued success depends in part on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. Even if we react appropriately to negative posts or comments about us and/or our brands on social media and online, our customers’ perception of our brand image and our reputation could be negatively impacted. In addition, customer sentiment could be shaped by our sustainability policies and related design, sourcing and operations decisions. Failure to maintain, enhance and protect our brand image could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.7The failure to attract and retain key personnel, or effectively manage succession, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing apparel trends depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel in our design, merchandising, sourcing, marketing, and other functions. In addition, several of our strategic initiatives, including our technology initiatives and supply chain initiatives, require that we hire and/or develop employees with appropriate experience. Competition for talent is intense, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods. If we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate talented employees with the appropriate skill sets, or if changes to our organizational structure, operating results, or business model adversely affect morale or retention, we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor to a key role could have a material adverse effect on our business. In fiscal 2018, there were changes to our management team, including our new President and Chief Executive Officer of Gap brand. The effectiveness of new leaders in these roles, and any further transition as a result of these changes, could have a significant impact on our results of operations.Our investments in customer, digital, and omni-channel shopping initiatives may not deliver the results we anticipate.One of our strategic priorities is to further develop an omni-channel shopping experience for our customers through the integration of our store and digital shopping channels. Our omni-channel initiatives include cross-channel logistics optimization and exploring additional ways to develop an omni-channel shopping experience, including further digital integration and customer personalization. These initiatives involve significant investments in IT systems and significant operational changes. In addition, our competitors are also investing in omni-channel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives. If the implementation of our customer, digital, and omni-channel initiatives is not successful, or we do not realize the return on our investments in these initiatives that we anticipate, our operating results would be adversely affected.If we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our gross margins could be adversely affected.Fluctuations in the global apparel retail markets impact the levels of inventory owned by apparel retailers. The nature of the global apparel retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to the peak holiday selling season when we build up our inventory levels. Merchandise usually must be ordered well in advance of the season and frequently before apparel trends are confirmed by customer purchases. We must enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. In the past, we have not always predicted our customers’ preferences and acceptance levels of our trend items with accuracy. If sales do not meet expectations, too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower-than-planned margins.We have key strategic initiatives designed to optimize our inventory levels and increase the efficiency and responsiveness of our supply chain, including vendor fabric platforming, product demand testing, and in-season rapid response to demand. These initiatives involve significant systems and operational changes, and we have limited experience operating in this manner. If we are unable to implement these initiatives successfully, we may not realize the return on our investments that we anticipate, and our operating results could be adversely affected.8We are subject to data and security risks, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and consumer confidence in our security measures.As part of our normal operations, we receive and maintain confidential, proprietary, and personally identifiable information, including credit card information, and information about our customers, our employees, job applicants, and other third parties. Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of this information. However, despite our safeguards and security processes and protections, security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. The retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. We may not have the resources to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our vendors or customers, or others who have entrusted us with information. In addition, even if we take appropriate measures to safeguard our information security and privacy environment from security breaches, we could still expose our customers and our business to risk. Actual or anticipated attacks may disrupt or impair our technology capabilities, and may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. Measures we implement to protect against cyber attacks may also have the potential to impact our customers’ shopping experience or decrease activity on our websites by making them more difficult to use. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breach by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. In addition, the global regulatory environment surrounding information security, cybersecurity, and privacy is increasingly demanding, with new laws, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which give customers the right to control how their personal information is collected, used and retained. Violating these rights, or failing to secure personal information could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of consumer confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.Failures of, or updates or changes to, our IT systems may disrupt operations.We maintain a complex network of legacy systems. We require continual maintenance, upgrades and changes, some of which are significant. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with maintaining and replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and addressing system disruptions and believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks through testing, training, and staging implementation, as well as ensuring appropriate commercial contracts are in place with third-party vendors supplying or supporting our IT initiatives. However, there can be no assurances that we will successfully maintain or launch these systems as planned or that they will be implemented without disruptions to our operations. IT system disruptions or failures, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, or failure to successfully implement new or upgraded systems, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.9Our business is subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing.Independent third parties manufacture all of our products for us. As a result, we are directly impacted by increases in the cost of those products.If we experience significant increases in demand or need to replace an existing vendor, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or that any vendor would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, for any new manufacturing source, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our vendors in our methods, products, quality control standards, and environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. Moreover, in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the manufacture of our products could result in lower sales and net income. In addition, certain countries represent a larger portion of our global sourcing. For example, approximately 28 percent and 21 percent of our merchandise, by dollar value, is purchased from factories in Vietnam and China, respectively. Accordingly, any delays in production and added costs in Vietnam or China could have a more significant impact on our results of operations.Because independent vendors manufacture virtually all of our products outside of our principal sales markets, third parties must transport our products over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with transitioning between vendors, could adversely impact our financial performance. Operating or manufacturing delays, transportation delays, or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as aircraft, which could adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, the cost of fuel is a significant component of transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our gross margins.Global economic conditions and any related impact on consumer spending patterns could adversely impact our results of operations.The Company’s performance is subject to global economic conditions, as well as their impact on levels of consumer spending worldwide. Some of the factors that may influence consumer spending include high levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on market declines and uncertainty, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, fluctuating interest and foreign currency rates and credit availability, government austerity measures, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty.Adverse economic changes in any of the regions in which we and our franchisees sell our products could reduce consumer confidence, and thereby could negatively affect earnings and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In challenging and uncertain economic environments, we cannot predict whether or when such circumstances may improve or worsen, or what impact, if any, such circumstances could have on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.10Our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful.Our current strategies include pursuing selective international expansion in a number of countries around the world through a number of channels. This includes our franchisees opening additional stores internationally. We have limited experience operating or franchising in some of these locations. In many of these locations, we face major, established competitors. In addition, in many of these locations, the real estate, employment and labor, transportation and logistics, regulatory, and other operating requirements differ dramatically from those in the places where we have more experience. Consumer tastes and trends may differ in many of these locations and, as a result, the sales of our products may not be successful or result in the margins we anticipate. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our operations and financial results could be materially, adversely affected.Risks associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries, including failure of our vendors to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct, could harm our business.We purchase nearly all merchandise from third-party vendors in many different countries, and we require those vendors to adhere to a Code of Vendor Conduct, which includes environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. From time to time, contractors or their subcontractors may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable local laws. Although we have implemented policies and procedures to facilitate our compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise into various countries, there can be no assurance that suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more vendors could have a negative impact on our reputation, could subject us to liability, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Our franchise business is subject to certain risks not directly within our control that could impair the value of our brands.We enter into franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate stores and, in limited circumstances, websites, in many countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores and websites that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. The effect of these arrangements on our business and results of operations is uncertain and will depend upon various factors, including the demand for our products in new markets internationally and our ability to successfully identify appropriate third parties to act as franchisees, distributors, or in a similar capacity. In addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as franchisee financial stability and the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store locations, store openings, and sales. Other risks that may affect these third parties include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, foreign exchange rates, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and political instability. Moreover, while the agreements we have entered into and plan to enter into in the future provide us with certain termination rights, the value of our brands could be impaired to the extent that these third parties do not operate their stores in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.11The market for prime real estate is competitive.Our ability to effectively obtain real estate - to open new stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices nationally and internationally - depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics, and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases. In addition, we may seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition, relocate, or close some of our real estate locations, which in most cases requires a modification of an existing store lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations, successfully modify or exit existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Additionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties within the United States and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and the quality of our decisions to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Our business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and our hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks.We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, operating expenses, profits, assets, and liabilities generated or incurred in foreign currencies as well as inventory purchases in U.S. dollars for our foreign subsidiaries. Although we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in fully offsetting the negative impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally only delay the impact of adverse foreign currency rate movements on our business and financial results. We experience fluctuations in our comparable sales and margins.Our success depends in part on our ability to improve sales, in particular at our largest brands. A variety of factors affect comparable sales or margins, including but not limited to apparel trends, competition, current economic conditions, the timing of new merchandise releases and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs, foreign currency fluctuations, industry traffic trends, and weather conditions. These factors may cause our comparable sales results and margins to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations. Our comparable sales, including the associated comparable online sales, have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual and quarterly basis. Over the past fiscal year, our reported quarterly comparable sales have ranged from a high of positive 2 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 to a low of negative 1 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Over the past five years, our reported gross margins have ranged from a high of 38.3 percent in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2014 to a low of 36.2 percent in fiscal 2015. In addition, over the past five years, our reported operating margins have ranged from a high of 12.7 percent in fiscal 2014 to a low of 7.7 percent in fiscal 2016.Our ability to deliver strong comparable sales results and margins depends in large part on accurately forecasting demand and apparel trends, selecting effective marketing techniques, providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base, managing inventory effectively, using effective pricing strategies, and optimizing store performance. Failure to meet the expectations of investors, securities analysts, or credit rating agencies in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of our common stock, cause our credit ratings to decline, and impact liquidity.12Changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the capital markets and adversely impact our financial position or our business initiatives.In April 2011, we issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.95 percent notes due April 2021. As a result, we have additional costs that include interest payable semi-annually on the notes.Our cash flows from operations are the primary source of funds for these debt service payments. In this regard, we have generated annual cash flow from operating activities in excess of $1 billion per year for well over a decade and ended fiscal 2018 with $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. We are also able to supplement near-term liquidity, if necessary, with our $500 million revolving credit facility. We continue to target a cash balance between $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion, which provides not only for our working capital needs, but also a reserve for unexpected business downturns. However, if our cash flows from operating activities decline significantly, we may be required to reprioritize our business initiatives to ensure that we can continue to service or refinance our debt with favorable rates and terms. In addition, any future reduction in our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets and higher interest costs and potentially increased lease or hedging costs.In May 2016, Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor's Rating Services downgraded their respective credit ratings of us from BBB- negative outlook to BB+ stable outlook. These downgrades, and any future reduction in our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings, could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets, more restrictive covenants in future financial documents and higher interest costs, and potentially increased lease or hedging costs.For further information on our debt and credit facilities, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes 4 and 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain.Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States or other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type, or effect of any such restrictions. For example, the current political landscape has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to future tax and trade regulations. In addition, we face the possibility of anti-dumping or countervailing duties lawsuits from U.S. domestic producers. We are unable to determine the impact of the changes to the quota system or the impact that potential tariff lawsuits could have on our global sourcing operations. Our sourcing operations may be adversely affected by trade limits or political and financial instability, resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries, significant fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and/or other trade disruptions. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, such as the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Laws and regulations at the local, state, federal, and international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that may result from changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape.Any changes in laws or regulations, the imposition of additional laws or regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts employment and labor, trade, product safety, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, privacy, operations, or environmental issues, among others, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.13Our results could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, negative global climate patterns, or other catastrophic events.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, and other adverse weather conditions; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics; political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, labor unrest, and other political instability; negative global climate patterns, especially in water stressed regions; or other catastrophic events, such as fires or other disasters occurring at our distribution centers or our vendors' manufacturing facilities, whether occurring in the United States or internationally, could disrupt our operations, including the operations of our franchisees, or the operations of one or more of our vendors. In particular, these types of events could impact our supply chain from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability or the ability of our franchisees or other third parties to operate our stores or websites. In addition, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or, depending upon the severity, globally. Disasters occurring at our vendors’ manufacturing facilities could impact our reputation and our customers’ perception of our brands. To the extent any of these events occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.Reductions in income and cash flow from our credit card arrangement related to our private label and co-branded credit cards could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. A third-party, Synchrony Financial (“Synchrony”), owns and services our private label credit card and co-branded programs. Our agreement with Synchrony provides for certain payments to be made by Synchrony to us, including a share of revenues from the performance of the credit card portfolios. The income and cash flow that we receive from Synchrony is dependent upon a number of factors, including the level of sales on private label and co-branded accounts, the level of balances carried on the accounts, payment rates on the accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on the accounts, the level of credit losses for the accounts, Synchrony’s ability to extend credit to our customers as well as the cost of customer rewards programs. All of these factors can vary based on changes in federal and state credit card, banking, and commercial protection laws. The factors affecting the income and cash flow that the Company receives from Synchrony can also vary based on a variety of economic, legal, social, and other factors that we cannot control. If the income and cash flow that we receive from our consumer credit card program agreement with Synchrony decreases significantly, our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected. We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims from time to time, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.As a multinational company, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims (“Actions”) arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these Actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, intellectual property, customer, employment, and data privacy claims, including class action lawsuits. The plaintiffs in some Actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages and some are covered in part by insurance. We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of Actions brought against us. Accordingly, developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and impact income in the quarter of such development, settlement, or resolution. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations"

.Our past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance because actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties discussed below. In addition, historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.We must successfully gauge apparel trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed.Our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our design and purchasing decisions may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing apparel trends or consumer acceptance of our products. The global apparel retail business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences, dictated in part by apparel trends and season. To the extent we misjudge the market for our merchandise or the products suitable for local markets or fail to execute trends and deliver product to market as timely as our competitors, our sales will be adversely affected, and the markdowns required to move the resulting excess inventory will adversely affect our operating results. Our business is highly competitive.The global apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We and our franchisees compete with local, national, and global department stores, specialty and discount store chains, independent retail stores, and online businesses that market similar lines of merchandise. We face a variety of competitive challenges in an increasingly complex and fast-paced environment, including:•anticipating and quickly responding to changing apparel trends and customer demands;•attracting customer traffic both in stores and online;•competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value;•maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to customers in several diverse market segments and geographic locations;•anticipating and responding to changing customer shopping preferences and practices, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement, social media communication, and online shopping;•developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to customers of varying age groups and tastes; •purchasing and stocking merchandise to match seasonal weather patterns, and our ability to react to shifts in weather that impact consumer demand; •sourcing and allocating merchandise efficiently; and•improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our processes in order to deliver cost savings to fund growth.If we or our franchisees are not able to compete successfully in the United States or internationally, our results of operations would be adversely affected.We must maintain our reputation and brand image.Our brands have wide recognition, and our success has been due in large part to our ability to maintain, enhance and protect our brand image and reputation and our customers’ connection to our brands. Our continued success depends in part on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. Even if we react appropriately to negative posts or comments about us and/or our brands on social media and online, our customers’ perception of our brand image and our reputation could be negatively impacted. In addition, customer sentiment could be shaped by our sustainability policies and related design, sourcing and operations decisions. Failure to maintain, enhance and protect our brand image could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.5The failure to attract and retain key personnel, or effectively manage succession, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing apparel trends depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel in our design, merchandising, sourcing, marketing, and other functions. In addition, several of our strategic initiatives, including our technology initiatives and supply chain initiatives, require that we hire and/or develop employees with appropriate experience. Competition for talent is intense, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods. If we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate talented employees with the appropriate skill sets, or if changes to our organizational structure, operating results, or business model adversely affect morale or retention, we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor to a key role could have a material adverse effect on our business. In fiscal 2017, there were changes to our senior leadership team, including our new President and Chief Executive Officer of Banana Republic, and our new Executive Vice President and Chief People Officer. In addition, in February 2018, we announced the departure of our President and Chief Executive Officer of Gap brand. The effectiveness of new leaders in these roles, and any further transition as a result of these changes, could have a significant impact on our results of operations.Our investments in customer, digital, and omni-channel shopping initiatives may not deliver the results we anticipate.One of our strategic priorities is to further develop an omni-channel shopping experience for our customers through the integration of our store and digital shopping channels. Our omni-channel initiatives include cross-channel logistics optimization and exploring additional ways to develop an omni-channel shopping experience, including further digital integration and customer personalization. These initiatives involve significant investments in IT systems and significant operational changes. In addition, our competitors are also investing in omni-channel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives. If the implementation of our customer, digital, and omni-channel initiatives is not successful, or we do not realize the return on our investments in these initiatives that we anticipate, our operating results would be adversely affected.If we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our gross margins could be adversely affected.Fluctuations in the global apparel retail markets impact the levels of inventory owned by apparel retailers. The nature of the global apparel retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to the peak holiday selling season when we build up our inventory levels. Merchandise usually must be ordered well in advance of the season and frequently before apparel trends are confirmed by customer purchases. We must enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. In the past, we have not always predicted our customers’ preferences and acceptance levels of our trend items with accuracy. If sales do not meet expectations, too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower-than-planned margins.We have key strategic initiatives designed to optimize our inventory levels and increase the efficiency and responsiveness of our supply chain, including vendor fabric platforming, product demand testing, and in-season rapid response to demand. These initiatives involve significant systems and operational changes, and we have limited experience operating in this manner. If we are unable to implement these initiatives successfully, we may not realize the return on our investments that we anticipate, and our operating results could be adversely affected.6We are subject to data and security risks, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and consumer confidence in our security measures.As part of our normal operations, we receive and maintain confidential, proprietary, and personally identifiable information, including credit card information, and information about our customers, our employees, job applicants, and other third parties. Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of this information. However, despite our safeguards and security processes and protections, security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. The retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. We may not have the resources to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our vendors or customers, or others who have entrusted us with information. In addition, even if we take appropriate measures to safeguard our information security and privacy environment from security breaches, we could still expose our customers and our business to risk. Actual or anticipated attacks may disrupt or impair our technology capabilities, and may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. Measures we implement to protect against cyber attacks may also have the potential to impact our customers’ shopping experience or decrease activity on our websites by making them more difficult to use. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breach by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. In addition, the global regulatory environment surrounding information security, cybersecurity, and privacy is increasingly demanding, with new and changing requirements, such as the European Union's General Protection Regulation (GDPR), and customers have a high expectation that the Company will adequately protect their personal information from cyber-attack or other security breaches. Security breaches and cyber incidents could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of consumer confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.Failures of, updates or changes to, our IT systems may disrupt operations.We maintain a complex network of legacy systems. We require continual maintenance, upgrades and changes, some of which are significant. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with maintaining and replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and addressing system disruptions and believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks through testing, training, and staging implementation, as well as ensuring appropriate commercial contracts are in place with third-party vendors supplying or supporting our IT initiatives. However, there can be no assurances that we will successfully maintain or launch these systems as planned or that they will be implemented without disruptions to our operations. IT system disruptions or failures, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, or failure to successfully implement new or upgraded systems, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.7Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain.Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States or other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type, or effect of any such restrictions. For example, the current political landscape has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to future tax and trade regulations. In addition, we face the possibility of anti-dumping or countervailing duties lawsuits from U.S. domestic producers. We are unable to determine the impact of the changes to the quota system or the impact that potential tariff lawsuits could have on our global sourcing operations. Our sourcing operations may be adversely affected by trade limits or political and financial instability, resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries, significant fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and/or other trade disruptions. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, such as the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Laws and regulations at the local, state, federal, and international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that may result from changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape.Any changes in laws or regulations, the imposition of additional laws or regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts employment and labor, trade, product safety, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, privacy, operations, or environmental issues, among others, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Our business is subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing.Independent third parties manufacture all of our products for us. As a result, we are directly impacted by increases in the cost of those products.If we experience significant increases in demand or need to replace an existing vendor, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or that any vendor would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, for any new manufacturing source, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our vendors in our methods, products, quality control standards, and environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. Moreover, in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the manufacture of our products could result in lower sales and net income. In addition, certain countries represent a larger portion of our global sourcing. For example, approximately 25 percent and 22 percent of our merchandise, by dollar value, is purchased from factories in Vietnam and China, respectively. Accordingly, any delays in production and added costs in Vietnam or China could have a more significant impact on our results of operations.Because independent vendors manufacture virtually all of our products outside of our principal sales markets, third parties must transport our products over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with transitioning between vendors, could adversely impact our financial performance. Operating or manufacturing delays, transportation delays, or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as aircraft, which could adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, the cost of fuel is a significant component of transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our gross margins.8Global economic conditions and any related impact on consumer spending patterns could adversely impact our results of operations.The Company’s performance is subject to global economic conditions, as well as their impact on levels of consumer spending worldwide. Some of the factors that may influence consumer spending include high levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on market declines and uncertainty, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, fluctuating interest and foreign currency rates and credit availability, government austerity measures, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty.Adverse economic changes in any of the regions in which we and our franchisees sell our products could reduce consumer confidence, and thereby could negatively affect earnings and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In challenging and uncertain economic environments, we cannot predict whether or when such circumstances may improve or worsen, or what impact, if any, such circumstances could have on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.Our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful.Our current strategies include pursuing selective international expansion in a number of countries around the world through a number of channels. This includes our franchisees opening additional stores internationally. We have limited experience operating or franchising in some of these locations. In many of these locations, we face major, established competitors. In addition, in many of these locations, the real estate, employment and labor, transportation and logistics, regulatory, and other operating requirements differ dramatically from those in the places where we have more experience. Consumer tastes and trends may differ in many of these locations and, as a result, the sales of our products may not be successful or result in the margins we anticipate. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our operations and financial results could be materially, adversely affected.Risks associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries, including failure of our vendors to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct, could harm our business.We purchase nearly all merchandise from third-party vendors in many different countries, and we require those vendors to adhere to a Code of Vendor Conduct, which includes environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. From time to time, contractors or their subcontractors may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable local laws. Although we have implemented policies and procedures to facilitate our compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise into various countries, there can be no assurance that suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more vendors could have a negative impact on our reputation, could subject us to liability, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.9Our franchise business is subject to certain risks not directly within our control that could impair the value of our brands.We enter into franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate stores and, in limited circumstances, websites, in many countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores and websites that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. The effect of these arrangements on our business and results of operations is uncertain and will depend upon various factors, including the demand for our products in new markets internationally and our ability to successfully identify appropriate third parties to act as franchisees, distributors, or in a similar capacity. In addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as franchisee financial stability and the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store locations, store openings, and sales. Other risks that may affect these third parties include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, foreign exchange rates, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and political instability. Moreover, while the agreements we have entered into and plan to enter into in the future provide us with certain termination rights, the value of our brands could be impaired to the extent that these third parties do not operate their stores in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.The market for prime real estate is competitive.Our ability to effectively obtain real estate - to open new stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices nationally and internationally - depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics, and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases. In addition, we may seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition, relocate, or close some of our real estate locations, which in most cases requires a modification of an existing store lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations, successfully modify or exit existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Additionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties within the United States and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and the quality of our decisions to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Our business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and our hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks.We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, operating expenses, profits, assets, and liabilities generated or incurred in foreign currencies as well as inventory purchases in U.S. dollars for our foreign subsidiaries. Although we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in fully offsetting the negative impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally only delay the impact of adverse foreign currency rate movements on our business and financial results. 10We experience fluctuations in our comparable sales and margins.Our success depends in part on our ability to improve sales, in particular at our largest brands. A variety of factors affect comparable sales or margins, including but not limited to apparel trends, competition, current economic conditions, the timing of new merchandise releases and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs, foreign currency fluctuations, industry traffic trends, and weather conditions. These factors may cause our comparable sales results and margins to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations. Our comparable sales, including the associated comparable online sales, have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual and quarterly basis. Over the past fiscal year, our reported quarterly comparable sales have ranged from a high of positive 5 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 to a low of positive 1 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Over the past five years, our reported gross margins have ranged from a high of 39.0 percent in fiscal 2013 to a low of 36.2 percent in fiscal 2015. In addition, over the past five years, our reported operating margins have ranged from a high of 13.3 percent in fiscal 2013 to a low of 7.7 percent in fiscal 2016.Our ability to deliver strong comparable sales results and margins depends in large part on accurately forecasting demand and apparel trends, selecting effective marketing techniques, providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base, managing inventory effectively, using effective pricing strategies, and optimizing store performance. Failure to meet the expectations of investors, securities analysts, or credit rating agencies in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of our common stock, cause our credit ratings to decline, and impact liquidity.Changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the capital markets and adversely impact our financial position or our business initiatives.In April 2011, we issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.95 percent notes due April 2021. As a result, we have additional costs that include interest payable semi-annually on the notes. In January 2014, we also entered into a 15 billion Japanese yen, four-year, unsecured term loan which was fully repaid in June 2017.Our cash flows from operations are the primary source of funds for these debt service payments. In this regard, we have generated annual cash flow from operating activities in excess of $1 billion per year for well over a decade and ended fiscal 2017 with $1.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. We are also able to supplement near-term liquidity, if necessary, with our $500 million revolving credit facility. We continue to target a cash balance between $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion, which provides not only for our working capital needs, but also a reserve for unexpected business downturns. However, if our cash flows from operating activities decline significantly, we may be required to reprioritize our business initiatives to ensure that we can continue to service or refinance our debt with favorable rates and terms. In addition, any future reduction in our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets and higher interest costs and potentially increased lease or hedging costs.In May 2016, Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor's Rating Services downgraded their respective credit ratings of us from BBB- negative outlook to BB+ stable outlook. These downgrades, and any future reduction in our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings, could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets, more restrictive covenants in future financial documents and higher interest costs, and potentially increased lease or hedging costs.For further information on our debt and credit facilities, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes 4 and 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.11Our results could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, negative global climate patterns, or other catastrophic events.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, and other adverse weather conditions; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics; political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, labor unrest, and other political instability; negative global climate patterns, especially in water stressed regions; or other catastrophic events, such as fires or other disasters occurring at our distribution centers or our vendors' manufacturing facilities, whether occurring in the United States or internationally, could disrupt our operations, including the operations of our franchisees, or the operations of one or more of our vendors. In particular, these types of events could impact our supply chain from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability or the ability of our franchisees or other third parties to operate our stores or websites. In addition, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or, depending upon the severity, globally. Disasters occurring at our vendors’ manufacturing facilities could impact our reputation and our customers’ perception of our brands. To the extent any of these events occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.Reductions in income and cash flow from our credit card arrangement related to our private label and co-branded credit cards could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. A third-party, Synchrony Financial (“Synchrony”), owns and services our private label credit card and co-branded programs. Our agreement with Synchrony provides for certain payments to be made by Synchrony to us, including a share of revenues from the performance of the credit card portfolios. The income and cash flow that we receive from Synchrony is dependent upon a number of factors, including the level of sales on private label and co-branded accounts, the level of balances carried on the accounts, payment rates on the accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on the accounts, the level of credit losses for the accounts, Synchrony’s ability to extend credit to our customers as well as the cost of customer rewards programs. All of these factors can vary based on changes in federal and state credit card, banking, and commercial protection laws. The factors affecting the income and cash flow that the Company receives from Synchrony can also vary based on a variety of economic, legal, social, and other factors that we cannot control. If the income and cash flow that we receive from our consumer credit card program agreement with Synchrony decreases significantly, our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected. We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims from time to time, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.As a multinational company, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims (“Actions”) arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these Actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, intellectual property, customer, employment, and data privacy claims, including class action lawsuits. The plaintiffs in some Actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages and some are covered in part by insurance. We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of Actions brought against us. Accordingly, developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and impact income in the quarter of such development, settlement, or resolution. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations"

In fiscal 2016, there were changes to our senior leadership team, including our new Chief Customer Officer and our new Chief Financial Officer. In addition, in March 2017, we announced the appointment of the new President and Chief Executive Officer of Banana Republic who will be joining the Company in May 2017. The effectiveness of the new leaders in these roles, and any further transition as a result of these changes, could have a significant impact on our results of operations.Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain.Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions on imported merchandise or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Laws and regulations at the local, state, federal, and international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that may result from changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape. For example, U.S. lawmakers are evaluating proposals for comprehensive reform of the U.S. federal corporate tax system, which could include a border-adjustment tax or other increased taxes on imports, a limit on the ability to defer U.S. taxation on earnings outside the United States until those earnings are repatriated to the United States, and a lower U.S. federal tax rate.  These proposed changes to the federal tax law, if enacted as currently proposed, could have a material adverse effect to our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Any changes in laws or regulations, the imposition of additional laws or regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts employment and labor, trade, product safety, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, privacy, operations, or environmental issues, among others, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.6Our investments in omni-channel shopping initiatives may not deliver the results we anticipate.One of our strategic priorities is to further develop an omni-channel shopping experience for our customers through the integration of our store and digital shopping channels. An example of our recent omni-channel initiatives includes cross-channel logistics optimization. We continue to explore additional ways to develop an omni-channel shopping experience, including further digital integration and customer personalization. These initiatives involve significant investments in IT systems and significant operational changes. In addition, our competitors are also investing in omni-channel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives. If the implementation of our omni-channel initiatives is not successful, or we do not realize the return on our omni-channel investments that we anticipate, our operating results would be adversely affected.If we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our gross margins could be adversely affected.Fluctuations in the global apparel retail markets impact the levels of inventory owned by apparel retailers.

In the past, we have not always predicted our customers’ preferences and acceptance levels of our trend items with accuracy. If sales do not meet expectations, too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower-than-planned margins.We have key strategic initiatives designed to optimize our inventory levels and increase the efficiency and responsiveness of our supply chain, including vendor fabric platforming, product demand testing, and in-season rapid response to demand. These initiatives involve significant systems and operational changes, and we have limited experience operating in this manner. If we are unable to implement these initiatives successfully, we may not realize the return on our investments that we anticipate, and our operating results could be adversely affected.We are subject to data security risks, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and consumer confidence in our security measures.As part of our normal operations, we receive and maintain confidential, proprietary, and personally identifiable information, including credit card information, and information about our customers, our employees, job applicants, and other third parties. Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of this information. However, despite our safeguards and security processes and protections, security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. The retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. We may not have the resources to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our vendors or customers, or others who have entrusted us with information. In addition, even if we take appropriate measures to safeguard our information security and privacy environment from security breaches, we could still expose our customers and our business to risk. Actual or anticipated attacks may disrupt or impair our technology capabilities, and may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. Measures we implement to protect against cyber attacks may also have the potential to impact our customers’ shopping experience or decrease activity on our websites by making them more difficult to use. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breach by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. In addition, the regulatory environment surrounding information security, cybersecurity, and privacy is increasingly demanding, with new and changing requirements, and customers have a high expectation that the Company will adequately protect their personal information from cyber-attack or other security breaches. Security breaches and cyber incidents could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial 7exposure, and a loss of consumer confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.Our business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and our hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks.We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, operating expenses, profits, assets, and liabilities generated or incurred in foreign currencies as well as inventory purchases in U.S. dollars for our foreign subsidiaries. Although we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in fully offsetting the negative impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally only delay the impact of adverse foreign currency rate movements on our business and financial results. We expect a negative impact to continue in fiscal year 2017. Our business is subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing.Independent third parties manufacture all of our products for us. As a result, we are directly impacted by increases in the cost of those products.If we experience significant increases in demand or need to replace an existing vendor, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or that any vendor would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, for any new manufacturing source, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our vendors in our methods, products, quality control standards, and environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. Moreover, in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the manufacture of our products could result in lower sales and net income. In addition, certain countries represent a larger portion of our global sourcing. For example, approximately 25 percent and 23 percent of our merchandise, by dollar value, is purchased from factories in Vietnam and China, respectively. Accordingly, any delays in production and added costs in Vietnam or China could have a more significant impact on our results of operations.Because independent vendors manufacture virtually all of our products outside of our principal sales markets, third parties must transport our products over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with transitioning between vendors, could adversely impact our financial performance. Manufacturing delays, transportation delays, or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as aircraft, which could adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, the cost of fuel is a significant component of transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our gross margins.Global economic conditions and any related impact on consumer spending patterns could adversely impact our results of operations.The Company’s performance is subject to global economic conditions, as well as their impact on levels of consumer spending worldwide. Some of the factors that may influence consumer spending include high levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on market declines and uncertainty, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, fluctuating interest and foreign currency rates and credit availability, government austerity measures, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty.8Adverse economic changes in any of the regions in which we and our franchisees sell our products could reduce consumer confidence, and thereby could negatively affect earnings and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In challenging and uncertain economic environments, we cannot predict whether or when such circumstances may improve or worsen, or what impact, if any, such circumstances could have on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.Our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful.Our current strategies include pursuing selective international expansion in a number of countries around the world through a number of channels. We currently plan to open additional Old Navy stores outside of the United States, including in Mexico and China, open additional Gap stores in China, including outlet stores, and continue to grow online sales internationally. Our franchisees plan to open additional stores internationally. We have limited experience operating or franchising in some of these locations. In many of these locations, we face major, established competitors. In addition, in many of these locations, the real estate, employment and labor, transportation and logistics, regulatory, and other operating requirements differ dramatically from those in the places where we have more experience. Consumer tastes and trends may differ in many of these locations and, as a result, the sales of our products may not be successful or result in the margins we anticipate. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our operations and financial results could be materially, adversely affected.Risks associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries, including failure of our vendors to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct, could harm our business.We purchase nearly all merchandise from third-party vendors in many different countries, and we require those vendors to adhere to a Code of Vendor Conduct, which includes environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. From time to time, contractors or their subcontractors may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable local laws. Although we have implemented policies and procedures to facilitate our compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise into various countries, there can be no assurance that suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more vendors could have a negative impact on our reputation, could subject us to liability, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Our franchise business is subject to certain risks not directly within our control that could impair the value of our brands.We enter into franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate stores and, in limited circumstances, websites, in many countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores and websites that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. The effect of these arrangements on our business and results of operations is uncertain and will depend upon various factors, including the demand for our products in new markets internationally and our ability to successfully identify appropriate third parties to act as franchisees, distributors, or in a similar capacity. In addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as franchisee financial stability and the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store locations, store openings, and sales. Other risks that may affect these third parties include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, foreign exchange rates, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and political instability. Moreover, while the agreements we have entered into and plan to enter into in the future provide us with certain termination rights, the value of our brands could be impaired to the extent that these third parties do not operate their stores in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.9The market for prime real estate is competitive.Our ability to effectively obtain real estate - to open new stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices nationally and internationally - depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics, and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases. In addition, we may seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition, relocate, or close some of our real estate locations, which in most cases requires a modification of an existing store lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Additionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties within the United States and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and the quality of our decisions to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We experience fluctuations in our comparable sales and margins.Our success depends in part on our ability to improve sales, in particular at our largest brands. A variety of factors affect comparable sales or margins, including apparel trends, competition, current economic conditions, the timing of new merchandise releases and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs, foreign currency fluctuations, industry traffic trends, and weather conditions. These factors may cause our comparable sales results and margins to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations. Our comparable sales, including the associated comparable online sales, have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual, quarterly, and monthly basis. Over the past fiscal year, our reported quarterly comparable sales have ranged from a high of positive 2 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 to a low of negative 5 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Over the past five years, our reported gross margins have ranged from a high of 39.4 percent in fiscal 2012 to a low of 36.2 percent in fiscal 2015. In addition, over the past five years, our reported operating margins have ranged from a high of 13.3 percent in fiscal 2013 to a low of 7.7 percent in fiscal 2016.Our ability to deliver strong comparable sales results and margins depends in large part on accurately forecasting demand and apparel trends, selecting effective marketing techniques, providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base, managing inventory effectively, using effective pricing strategies, and optimizing store performance. Failure to meet the expectations of investors, securities analysts, or credit rating agencies in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of our common stock, cause our credit ratings to decline, and impact liquidity.Changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the capital markets and adversely impact our financial position or our business initiatives.In April 2011, we issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.95 percent notes due April 2021. As a result, we have additional costs that include interest payable semi-annually on the notes. In January 2014, we also entered into a 15 billion Japanese yen, four-year, unsecured term loan due January 2018. Our cash flows from operations are the primary source of funds for these debt service payments. In this regard, we have generated annual cash flow from operating activities in excess of $1 billion per year for well over a decade and ended fiscal 2016 with $1.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. We are also able to supplement near-term liquidity, if necessary, with our $500 million revolving credit facility. We continue to target a cash balance between $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion, which provides not only for our working capital needs, but also a reserve for unexpected business downturns. However, if our cash flows from operating activities decline significantly, we may be required to reprioritize our business initiatives to ensure that we can continue to service or refinance our debt with favorable rates and terms. In addition, any future reduction in our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets and higher interest costs and potentially increased lease or hedging costs.10In May 2016, Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor's Rating Services downgraded their respective credit ratings of us from BBB- negative outlook to BB+ stable outlook. These downgrades, and any future reduction in our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings, could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets, more restrictive covenants in future financial documents and higher interest costs, and potentially increased lease or hedging costs.For further information on our debt and credit facilities, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes 5 and 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.Updates or changes to our IT systems may disrupt operations.We continue to evaluate and implement upgrades and changes to our IT systems, some of which are significant. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions and believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks through testing, training, and staging implementation, as well as ensuring appropriate commercial contracts are in place with third-party vendors supplying or supporting our IT initiatives. However, there can be no assurances that we will successfully launch these systems as planned or that they will be implemented without disruptions to our operations. IT system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, or failure to successfully implement new or upgraded systems, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Our results could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, or other catastrophic events.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, and other adverse weather and climate conditions; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics; political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, labor unrest, and other political instability; or other catastrophic events, such as fires or other disasters occurring at our distribution centers or our vendors' manufacturing facilities, whether occurring in the United States or internationally, could disrupt our operations, including the operations of our franchisees, or the operations of one or more of our vendors. In particular, these types of events could impact our supply chain from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability or the ability of our franchisees or other third parties to operate our stores or websites. In addition, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or, depending upon the severity, globally. Disasters occurring at our vendors’ manufacturing facilities could impact our reputation and our customers’ perception of our brands. To the extent any of these events occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.Reductions in income and cash flow from our marketing and servicing arrangement related to our private label and co-branded credit cards could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. A third-party, Synchrony Financial (“Synchrony”), owns and services our private label credit card and co-branded programs. Our agreement with Synchrony provides for certain payments to be made by Synchrony to us, including a share of revenues from the performance of the credit card portfolios. The income and cash flow that we receive from Synchrony is dependent upon a number of factors, including the level of sales on private label and co-branded accounts, the level of balances carried on the accounts, payment rates on the accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on the accounts, the level of credit losses for the accounts, Synchrony’s ability to extend credit to our customers as well as the cost of customer rewards programs. All of these factors can vary based on changes in federal and state credit card, banking, and commercial protection laws. The factors affecting the income and cash flow that the Company receives from Synchrony can also vary based on a variety of economic, legal, social, and other factors that we cannot control. If the income and cash flow that we receive from our consumer credit card program agreement with Synchrony decreases significantly, our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected. 11We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims from time to time, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.As a multinational company, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims (“Actions”) arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these Actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, intellectual property, customer, employment, and data privacy claims, including class action lawsuits. The plaintiffs in some Actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages and some are covered in part by insurance. We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of Actions brought against us. Accordingly, developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and impact income in the quarter of such development, settlement, or resolution. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations"
0,GPS,GAP INC,2016-03-21,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
. Our past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance because actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties discussed below. In addition, historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.4We must successfully gauge apparel trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed.Our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our design and purchasing decisions may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing apparel trends or consumer acceptance of our products. The global apparel retail business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences, dictated in part by apparel trends and season. To the extent we misjudge the market for our merchandise or the products suitable for local markets or fail to execute trends and deliver product to market as timely as our competitors, our sales will be adversely affected, and the markdowns required to move the resulting excess inventory will adversely affect our operating results. For example, during fiscal 2015, product acceptance at Banana Republic and Gap brand, in particular, was below expectations, and as a result, our financial results were negatively impacted.Global economic conditions and the impact on consumer spending patterns could adversely impact our results of operations.The Company’s performance is subject to global economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending worldwide. Some of the factors that may influence consumer spending include high levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on market declines and uncertainty, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, fluctuating interest rates and credit availability, government austerity measures, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty.Adverse economic changes in any of the regions in which we and our franchisees sell our products could reduce consumer confidence, and thereby could negatively affect earnings and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In challenging and uncertain economic environments, we cannot predict whether or when such circumstances may improve or worsen, or what impact, if any, such circumstances could have on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.Our business is highly competitive.The global apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We and our franchisees compete with local, national, and global department stores, specialty and discount store chains, independent retail stores, and online businesses that market similar lines of merchandise. We face a variety of competitive challenges including:•anticipating and quickly responding to changing apparel trends and customer demands;•attracting customer traffic both in stores and online;•competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value;•maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to customers in several diverse market segments and geographic locations;•anticipating and responding to changing customer shopping preferences and practices, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement, social media communication, and online shopping;•developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to customers of varying age groups and tastes; •purchasing and stocking merchandise to match seasonal weather patterns, and our ability to react to shifts in weather that impact consumer demand; and•sourcing merchandise efficiently.If we or our franchisees are not able to compete successfully in the United States or internationally, our results of operations would be adversely affected.5If we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our gross margins could be adversely affected.Fluctuations in the global apparel retail markets impact the levels of inventory owned by apparel retailers. The nature of the global apparel retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to the peak holiday selling season when we build up our inventory levels. Merchandise usually must be ordered well in advance of the season and frequently before apparel trends are confirmed by customer purchases. We must enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. In the past, we have not always predicted our customers’ preferences and acceptance levels of our trend items with accuracy. If sales do not meet expectations, too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower than planned margins.We have key strategic initiatives designed to optimize our inventory levels and increase the efficiency and responsiveness of our supply chain, including vendor fabric platforming, product demand testing, and in-season rapid response to demand. These initiatives involve significant systems and operational changes and we have limited experience operating in this manner. If we are unable to implement these initiatives successfully, we may not realize the return on our investments that we anticipate, and our operating results could be adversely affected.The failure to attract and retain key personnel, or effectively manage succession, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing apparel trends depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel in our design, merchandising, marketing, and other functions. In addition, several of our strategic initiatives, including our technology initiatives and supply chain initiatives require that we hire and/or develop employees with appropriate experience. Competition for this personnel is intense, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods. If we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate talented employees with the appropriate skill sets, or if changes to our organizational structure, operating results, or business model adversely affect morale or retention, we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor to a key role could have a material adverse effect on our business. At the end of fiscal 2014 and beginning of fiscal 2015, there were several changes made to our senior leadership team, including our Chief Executive Officer; Global President, Gap; and Global President, Banana Republic. In October 2015, our Global President, Old Navy left the Company, and a search for a new global brand president is underway. The effectiveness of the new leaders in these roles, and any further transition as a result of these changes, could have a significant impact on our results of operations.We are subject to data security risks, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and consumer confidence in our security measures.As part of our normal operations, we receive and maintain confidential, proprietary, and personally identifiable information, including credit card information, about our customers, our employees, job applicants, and other third parties. Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of this information. However, despite our safeguards and security processes and protections, security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. The retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. We may not have the resources to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our customers, or others who have entrusted us with information. In addition, even if we take appropriate measures to safeguard our information security and privacy environment from security breaches, we could still expose our customers and our business to risk. Actual or anticipated attacks may disrupt or impair our technology capabilities, and may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. Measures we implement to protect against cyber-attacks may also have the potential to impact our customers’ shopping experience or decrease activity on our websites by making them more difficult to use. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breach by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the 6unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. In addition, the regulatory environment surrounding information security, cybersecurity, and privacy is increasingly demanding, with new and changing requirements, and customers have a high expectation that the Company will adequately protect their personal information from cyber-attack or other security breaches. Security breaches and cyber incidents could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of consumer confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.Our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful.Our current strategies include pursuing continued international expansion in a number of countries around the world through a number of channels. We currently plan to open additional Old Navy stores outside of the United States, including in Mexico, Japan, and China, open additional Gap stores in China, open additional international outlet stores, and continue to grow online sales internationally. Our franchisees plan to open additional stores internationally. We have limited experience operating or franchising in some of these locations. In many of these locations, we face major, established competitors. In addition, in many of these locations, the real estate, employment and labor, transportation and logistics, regulatory, and other operating requirements differ dramatically from those in the places where we have more experience. Consumer tastes and trends may differ in many of these locations and, as a result, the sales of our products may not be successful or result in the margins we anticipate. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our operations and financial results could be materially, adversely affected.Our business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and our hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks.We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, inventory purchases, operating expenses, profits, assets, and liabilities generated or incurred outside the U.S. Although we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in fully offsetting the negative impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally only delay the impact of adverse foreign currency rate movements on our business and financial results. For example, in fiscal year 2015, foreign exchange fluctuations, in particular the depreciation of the currencies in Canada and Japan where we have significant retail operations, had a significant impact on our financial results. We expect this impact to continue in fiscal year 2016. Our business, including our costs and supply chain, is subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing.Independent third parties manufacture all of our products for us. As a result, we are directly impacted by increases in the cost of those products.If we experience significant increases in demand or need to replace an existing vendor, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or that any vendor would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, for any new manufacturing source, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our vendors in our methods, products, quality control standards, and environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. Moreover, in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the manufacture of our products could result in lower sales and net income. In addition, certain countries represent a larger portion of our global sourcing. For example, approximately 24 percent of our merchandise, by dollar value, is purchased from factories in China. Accordingly, any delays in production and added costs in China could have a more significant impact on our results of operations.Because independent vendors manufacture virtually all of our products outside of our principal sales markets, third parties must transport our products over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with transitioning between vendors, could adversely impact our 7financial performance. For example, the work slowdowns and stoppages at U.S. West Coast ports at the end of fiscal 2014 and beginning of fiscal 2015 created product delivery delays that impacted our ability to effectively manage our inventory and deliver seasonally correct product in a timely manner, which impacted our financial results for fiscal 2015. Manufacturing delays, transportation delays, or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as aircraft, which could adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, the cost of fuel is a significant component in transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our gross margins.Risks associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries, including failure of our vendors to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct, could harm our business.We purchase nearly all merchandise from third-party vendors in many different countries and we require those vendors to adhere to a Code of Vendor Conduct, which includes environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. From time to time, contractors or their subcontractors may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable local laws. Although we have implemented policies and procedures to facilitate our compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise into various countries, there can be no assurance that suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more vendors could have a negative impact on our reputation, could subject us to liability, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain.Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States or other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type, or effect of any such restrictions. In addition, we face the possibility of anti-dumping or countervailing duties lawsuits from U.S. domestic producers. We are unable to determine the impact of the changes to the quota system or the impact that potential tariff lawsuits could have on our global sourcing operations. Our sourcing operations may be adversely affected by trade limits or political and financial instability, resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries, significant fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and/or other trade disruptions.Our franchise business is subject to certain risks not directly within our control that could impair the value of our brands.We enter into franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate stores and, in limited circumstances, websites, in many countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores and websites that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. The effect of these arrangements on our business and results of operations is uncertain and will depend upon various factors, including the demand for our products in new markets internationally and our ability to successfully identify appropriate third parties to act as franchisees, distributors, or in a similar capacity. In addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as franchisee financial stability and the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store locations, store openings, and sales. Other risks that may affect these third parties include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, foreign exchange rates, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and political instability. Moreover, while the agreements we have entered into and plan to enter into in the future provide us with certain termination rights, the value of our brands could be impaired to the extent that these third parties do not operate their stores in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.8The market for prime real estate is competitive.Our ability to effectively obtain real estate - to open new stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices nationally and internationally - depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics, and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases. In addition, from time to time, we may seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition, relocate, or close some of our real estate locations, which in most cases requires a modification of an existing store lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Additionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties within the United States and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and the quality of our decisions to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Our investments in omni-channel shopping initiatives may not deliver the results we anticipate.One of our strategic priorities is to further develop an omni-channel shopping experience for our customers through the integration of our store and digital shopping channels. Examples of our recent omni-channel initiatives include our ship-from-store, reserve-in-store, and order-in-store programs. We continue to explore additional ways to develop an omni-channel shopping experience, including further digital integration and customer personalization. These initiatives involve significant investments in IT systems and significant operational changes. In addition, our competitors are also investing in omni-channel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives. If the implementation of our omni-channel initiatives is not successful, or we do not realize the return on our omni-channel investments that we anticipate, our operating results would be adversely affected.We experience fluctuations in our comparable sales and margins.Our success depends in part on our ability to improve sales, in particular at our largest brands. A variety of factors affect comparable sales or margins, including apparel trends, competition, current economic conditions, the timing of new merchandise releases and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs, foreign currency fluctuations, and weather conditions. These factors may cause our comparable sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations. Our comparable sales, including the associated comparable online sales, have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual, quarterly, and monthly basis. Over the past fiscal year, our reported quarterly comparable sales have ranged from a high of negative 2 percent in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2015 to a low of negative 7 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Over the past five years, our reported gross margins have ranged from a high of 39.4 percent in fiscal 2012 to a low of 36.2 percent in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2011. In addition, over the past five years, our reported operating margins have ranged from a high of 13.3 percent in fiscal 2013 to a low of 9.6 percent in fiscal 2015.Our ability to deliver strong comparable sales results and margins depends in large part on accurately forecasting demand and apparel trends, selecting effective marketing techniques, providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base, managing inventory effectively, using effective pricing strategies, and optimizing store performance. Failure to meet the expectations of investors, securities analysts, or credit rating agencies in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of our common stock and cause our credit ratings to decline.9Changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the capital markets and adversely impact our financial results or our business initiatives.In April 2011, we issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.95 percent notes due April 2021. As a result, we have additional costs that include interest payable semiannually on the notes. In January 2014, we also entered into a 15 billion Japanese yen, four-year, unsecured term loan due January 2018.  In October 2015, we entered into a $400 million unsecured term loan due October 2016, but that may be extended until October 2017. Our cash flows from operations are the primary source of funds for these debt service payments. In this regard, we have generated annual cash flow from operating activities in excess of $1 billion per year for well over a decade and ended fiscal 2015 with $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. We are also able to supplement near-term liquidity, if necessary, with our $500 million revolving credit facility. We continue to target a cash balance between $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion, which provides not only for our working capital needs, but also a reserve for unexpected business downturns. However, if our cash flows from operating activities decline significantly, we may be required to reprioritize our business initiatives to ensure that we can continue to service or refinance our debt with favorable rates and terms. In addition, any future reduction in our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets and higher interest costs, and potentially increased lease or hedging costs.For further information on our debt and credit facilities, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes 4 and 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.Updates or changes to our IT systems may disrupt operations.We continue to evaluate and implement upgrades and changes to our IT systems, some of which are significant. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions, and believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks through testing, training, and staging implementation, as well as ensuring appropriate commercial contracts are in place with third-party vendors supplying or supporting our IT initiatives. However, there can be no assurances that we will successfully launch these systems as planned or that they will be implemented without disruptions to our operations. IT system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, or failure to successfully implement new or upgraded systems, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our results of operations.Our brands have wide recognition, and our success has been due in large part to our ability to maintain, enhance and protect our brand image and reputation, and our customers’ connection to our brands. Our continued success depends in part on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. Even if we react appropriately to negative posts or comments about us and/or our brands on social media and online, our customers’ perception of our brand image and our reputation could be negatively impacted. Failure to maintain, enhance and protect our brand image could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.10Our results could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, or other catastrophic events.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, and other adverse weather and climate conditions; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics; political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, labor unrest, and other political instability; or other catastrophic events, such as disasters occurring at our vendors' manufacturing facilities, whether occurring in the United States or internationally, could disrupt our operations, the operations of our franchisees, or the operations of one or more of our vendors. In particular, these types of events could impact our product supply chain from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability or the ability of our franchisees or other third parties to operate our stores or websites. In addition, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or depending upon the severity, globally. Disasters occurring at our vendors’ manufacturing facilities could impact our reputation and our customers’ perception of our brands. To the extent any of these events occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.Changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Laws and regulations at the local, state, federal, and international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that may result from changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts employment and labor, trade, product safety, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, privacy, operations, or environmental issues, among others, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims from time to time, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.As a multinational company, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims (“Actions”) arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these Actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, intellectual property, customer, employment, and data privacy claims, including class action lawsuits. The plaintiffs in some Actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages and some are covered in part by insurance. We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of Actions brought against us. Accordingly, developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and impact income in the quarter of such development, settlement, or resolution. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations"
18,GPS,GAP INC,2015-03-23,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.Our past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance because actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties discussed below. In addition, historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.We must successfully gauge apparel trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed.Our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our design and purchasing decisions may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing apparel trends or consumer acceptance of our products. The global apparel retail business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences, dictated in part by apparel trends and season. To the extent we misjudge the market for our merchandise or the products suitable for local markets or fail to execute trends and deliver product to market as timely as our competitors, our sales will be adversely affected, and the markdowns required to move the resulting excess inventory will adversely affect our operating results. For example, during fiscal 2014, product acceptance at Gap brand, in particular, was below expectations, and as a result, our financial results were negatively impacted.Global economic conditions and the impact on consumer spending patterns could adversely impact our results of operations.The Company’s performance is subject to global economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending worldwide. Some of the factors that may influence consumer spending include high levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on market declines and uncertainty, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, fluctuating interest rates and credit availability, government austerity measures, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty.Adverse economic changes in any of the regions in which we and our franchisees sell our products could reduce consumer confidence, and thereby could negatively affect earnings and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  In challenging and uncertain economic environments, we cannot predict whether or when such circumstances may improve or worsen, or what impact, if any, such circumstances could have on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.Our business is highly competitive.The global apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We and our franchisees compete with local, national, and global department stores, specialty and discount store chains, independent retail stores, and online businesses that market similar lines of merchandise. We face a variety of competitive challenges including:•anticipating and quickly responding to changing apparel trends and customer demands;•attracting customer traffic both in stores and online;•competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value;•maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to customers in several diverse market segments and geographic locations;•anticipating and responding to changing customer shopping preferences and practices, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement, social media communication, and online shopping;•developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to customers of varying age groups and tastes; and5•sourcing merchandise efficiently.If we or our franchisees are not able to compete successfully in the United States or internationally, our results of operations would be adversely affected.If we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our gross margins could be adversely affected.Fluctuations in the global apparel retail markets impact the levels of inventory owned by apparel retailers, as merchandise usually must be ordered well in advance of the season and frequently before apparel trends are confirmed by customer purchases. In addition, the nature of the global apparel retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to the peak holiday selling season when we build up our inventory levels. We must enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. In the past, we have not always predicted our customers’ preferences and acceptance levels of our trend items with accuracy. If sales do not meet expectations, too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower than planned margins.We have key strategic initiatives designed to optimize our inventory levels and increase the efficiency and responsiveness of our supply chain, including our seamless inventory and responsive supply chain initiatives.  Aspects of seamless inventory include more timely matching of product supply and demand across markets and channels to reduce stranded inventory.  Aspects of responsive supply chain include more vendor fabric platforming, product demand testing, and in-season rapid response to demand.  These initiatives involve significant systems and operational changes and we have limited experience operating in this manner. If we are unable to implement these initiatives successfully, we may not realize the return on our investments that we anticipate, and our operating results could be adversely affected.Our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful.Our current strategies include pursuing continued international expansion in a number of countries around the world through a number of channels. We currently plan to open additional Old Navy stores outside of North America, including in Japan and China, open additional Gap stores in China, open additional international outlet stores, and continue to grow online sales internationally. Our franchisees plan to open additional stores internationally. We have limited experience operating or franchising in some of these locations. In many of these locations, we face major, established competitors. In addition, in many of these locations, the real estate, employment and labor, transportation and logistics, regulatory, and other operating requirements differ dramatically from those in the places where we have more experience. Consumer tastes and trends may differ in many of these locations and, as a result, the sales of our products may not be successful or result in the margins we anticipate. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our operations and financial results could be materially, adversely affected.In addition, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, inventory purchases, operating expenses, profits, assets, and liabilities generated or incurred outside the U.S. Although we use instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in fully offsetting the negative impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally only delay the impact of adverse foreign currency rate movements on our business and financial results. For example, in fiscal year 2014, foreign exchange fluctuations, in particular the depreciation of the currencies in Canada and Japan where we have significant retail operations, had a significant impact on our financial results.  We expect this impact to continue in fiscal year 2015. Our business, including our costs and supply chain, is subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing.Independent third parties manufacture all of our products for us. As a result, we are directly impacted by increases in the cost of those products.6If we experience significant increases in demand or need to replace an existing vendor, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or that any vendor would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, for any new manufacturing source, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our vendors in our methods, products, quality control standards, and environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. Moreover, in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the manufacture of our products could result in lower sales and net income. In addition, certain countries represent a larger portion of our global sourcing. For example, approximately 27 percent of our merchandise, by dollar value, is purchased from factories in China. Accordingly, any delays in production and added costs in China could have a more significant impact on our results of operations.Because independent vendors manufacture virtually all of our products outside of our principal sales markets, third parties must transport our products over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with transitioning between vendors, could adversely impact our financial performance. For example, the work slowdowns and stoppages at U.S. West Coast ports at the end of fiscal 2014 and beginning of fiscal 2015 created product delivery delays that impacted our ability to effectively manage our inventory and deliver seasonally correct product in a timely manner, which could significantly impact our financial results for fiscal 2015. Manufacturing delays, transportation delays, or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as aircraft, which could adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, the cost of fuel is a significant component in transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our gross margins.Risks associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries, including failure of our vendors to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct, could harm our business.We purchase nearly all merchandise from third-party vendors in many different countries and we require those vendors to adhere to a Code of Vendor Conduct which includes environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. From time to time, contractors or their subcontractors may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable local laws. Although we have implemented policies and procedures to facilitate our compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise into various countries, there can be no assurance that suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more vendors could have a negative impact on our reputation, could subject us to liability, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain.Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States or other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type, or effect of any such restrictions. In addition, we face the possibility of anti-dumping or countervailing duties lawsuits from U.S. domestic producers. We are unable to determine the impact of the changes to the quota system or the impact that potential tariff lawsuits could have on our global sourcing operations. Our sourcing operations may be adversely affected by trade limits or political and financial instability, resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries, significant fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and/or other trade disruptions.7Our franchise business is subject to certain risks not directly within our control that could impair the value of our brands.We enter into franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate stores and, in limited circumstances, websites in many countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores and websites that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. The effect of these arrangements on our business and results of operations is uncertain and will depend upon various factors, including the demand for our products in new markets internationally and our ability to successfully identify appropriate third parties to act as franchisees, distributors, or in a similar capacity. In addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as franchisee financial stability and the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store locations, store openings, and sales. Other risks that may affect these third parties include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, foreign exchange rates, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and political instability. Moreover, while the agreements we have entered into and plan to enter into in the future provide us with certain termination rights, the value of our brands could be impaired to the extent that these third parties do not operate their stores in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.The market for prime real estate is competitive.Our ability to effectively obtain real estate - to open new stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices nationally and internationally - depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics, and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases. In addition, from time to time, we may seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition, relocate, or close some of our real estate locations, which in most cases requires a modification of an existing store lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Additionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties within the United States and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and the quality of our decisions to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We are subject to data security risks, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and consumer confidence in our security measures.As part of our normal operations, we receive and maintain confidential, proprietary, and personally identifiable information, including credit card information, about our customers, our employees, job applicants, and other third parties. Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of this information. However, despite our safeguards and security processes and protections, security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. The retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. We may not have the resources to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our customers, or others who have entrusted us with information. In addition, even if we take appropriate measures to safeguard our information security and privacy environment from security breaches, we could still expose our customers and our business to risk. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. Measures we implement to protect against cyber-attacks may also have the potential to impact our customers’ shopping experience or decrease activity on our websites by making them more difficult to use. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breach by our employees or 8by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. In addition, the regulatory environment surrounding information security, cybersecurity, and privacy is increasingly demanding, with new and changing requirements, and customers have a high expectation that the Company will adequately protect their personal information from cyber-attack or other security breaches. Security breaches and cyber incidents could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of consumer confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.The failure to attract and retain key personnel, or effectively manage succession, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing apparel trends depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel in our design, merchandising, marketing, and other functions. In addition, several of our strategic initiatives, including our technology initiatives and supply chain initiatives require that we hire and/or develop employees with appropriate experience. Competition for this personnel is intense, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods. If we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate talented employees with the appropriate skill sets, or if changes to our organizational structure, operating results, or business model adversely affect morale or retention, we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor to a key role could have a material adverse effect on our business. At the end of fiscal 2014 and beginning of fiscal 2015, there were several changes made to the members of our senior leadership team, including our Chief Executive Officer, Global President, Gap, and Global President, Banana Republic. The effectiveness of the new leaders in these roles, and any further transition as a result of these changes, could have a significant impact on our results of operations.Our investments in omni-channel shopping initiatives may not deliver the results we anticipate.One of our strategic priorities is to further develop an omni-channel shopping experience for our customers through the integration of our store and digital shopping channels. Examples of our recent omni-channel initiatives include our ship-from-store, reserve-in-store, and order-in-store programs. We continue to explore additional ways to develop an omni-channel shopping experience, including further digital integration and customer personalization. These initiatives involve significant investments in IT systems and significant operational changes. In addition, our competitors are also investing in omni-channel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives. If the implementation of our omni-channel initiatives is not successful, or we do not realize the return on our omni-channel investments that we anticipate, our operating results would be adversely affected.We experience fluctuations in our comparable sales and margins.Our success depends in part on our ability to improve sales, in particular at our largest brands. A variety of factors affect comparable sales or margins, including apparel trends, competition, current economic conditions, the timing of new merchandise releases and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs, foreign currency fluctuations, and weather conditions. These factors may cause our comparable sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations. Our comparable sales, including the associated comparable online sales, have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual, quarterly, and monthly basis. Over the past 12 months, our reported monthly comparable sales have ranged from an increase of 9 percent in April 2014 to a decrease of 7 percent in February 2014. Over the past five years, our reported gross margins have ranged from a high of 40.2 percent in fiscal 2010 to a low of 36.2 percent in fiscal 2011. In addition, over the past five years, our reported operating margins have ranged from a high of 13.4 percent in fiscal 2010 to a low of 9.9 percent in fiscal 2011.9Our ability to deliver strong comparable sales results and margins depends in large part on accurately forecasting demand and apparel trends, selecting effective marketing techniques, providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base, managing inventory effectively, using effective pricing strategies, and optimizing store performance. Failure to meet the expectations of investors, securities analysts, or credit rating agencies in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of our common stock and cause our credit ratings to decline.Changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the capital markets and adversely impact our financial results or our business initiatives.In April 2011, we issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.95 percent notes due April 2021. As a result, we have additional costs that include interest payable semiannually on the notes. In January 2014, we also entered into a 15 billion Japanese yen ($128 million as of January 31, 2015), four-year term loan due January 2018.Our cash flows from operations are the primary source of funds for these debt service payments. In this regard, we have generated annual cash flow from operating activities in excess of $1 billion per year for well over a decade and ended fiscal 2014 with $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. We are also able to supplement near-term liquidity, if necessary, with our $500 million revolving credit facility. We continue to target a cash balance between $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion, which provides not only for our working capital needs, but also a reserve for unexpected business downturns. However, if our cash flows from operating activities decline significantly, we may be required to reprioritize our business initiatives to ensure that we can continue to service or refinance our debt with favorable rates and terms. In addition, any future reduction in our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets and higher interest costs on future financings.For further information on our debt and credit facilities, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes 5 and 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.Updates or changes to our IT systems may disrupt operations.We continue to evaluate and implement upgrades and changes to our IT systems, some of which are significant. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions, and believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks through testing, training, and staging implementation, as well as ensuring appropriate commercial contracts are in place with third-party vendors supplying or supporting our IT initiatives. However, there can be no assurances that we will successfully launch these systems as planned or that they will be implemented without disruptions to our operations. IT system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, or failure to successfully implement new or upgraded systems, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.10Our results could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, or other catastrophic events.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, and other adverse weather and climate conditions; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics; political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, labor unrest, and other political instability; or other catastrophic events, such as disasters occurring at our vendors' manufacturing facilities, whether occurring in the United States or internationally, could disrupt our operations, the operations of our franchisees, or the operations of one or more of our vendors. In particular, these types of events could impact our product supply chain from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability or the ability of our franchisees or other third parties to operate our stores or websites. In addition, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or depending upon the severity, globally. Disasters occurring at our vendors’ manufacturing facilities could impact our reputation and our customers’ perception of our brands. To the extent any of these events occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.Changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Laws and regulations at the local, state, federal, and international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that may result from changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts employment and labor, trade, product safety, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, privacy, operations, or environmental issues, among others, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations"

In addition, historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.Global economic conditions and the impact on consumer spending patterns could adversely impact our results of operations.The Company’s performance is subject to global economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending worldwide.

If we are unable to implement these initiatives successfully, we may not realize the return on our investments that we anticipate, and our operating results could be adversely affected.Our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful.Our current strategies include moving to a global brand structure and pursuing continued international expansion in a number of countries around the world through a number of channels. Beginning in fiscal 2013, we combined all channels and geographies under one global leader for each of the Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy brands. Each global brand president oversees their brand's specialty, outlet, online, and franchise operations. In addition, we currently plan to open additional Old Navy stores outside of North America, open additional Gap stores in China, open additional international outlet stores, and continue to grow online sales internationally. We have limited experience operating in some of these locations. In many of these locations, we face major, established competitors. In addition, in many of these locations, the real estate, employment and labor, transportation and logistics, regulatory, and other operating requirements differ dramatically from those in the places where we have experience. Moreover, consumer tastes and trends may differ in many of these locations, and as a result, the sales of our products may not be successful or result in the margins we anticipate. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our operations and financial results could be materially, adversely affected.In addition, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, profits, assets, and liabilities generated or incurred outside the U.S. Although we use instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the negative impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally only delay the impact of adverse foreign currency rate movements on our business and financial results. Our business, including our costs and supply chain, is subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing.Independent third parties manufacture all of our products for us. As a result, we are directly impacted by increases in the cost of those products.6If we experience significant increases in demand or need to replace an existing vendor, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or that any vendor would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, for any new manufacturing source, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our vendors in our methods, products, quality control standards, and environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. Moreover, in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the manufacture of our products could result in lower sales and net income. In addition, certain countries represent a larger portion of our global sourcing. For example, approximately 28 percent of our merchandise, by dollar value, is purchased from China. Accordingly, any delays in production and added costs in this country could have a more significant impact on our results of operations.Because independent vendors manufacture all of our products outside of our principal sales markets, third parties must transport our products over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with transitioning between vendors, could adversely impact our financial performance. Manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as aircraft, which could adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, the cost of fuel is a significant component in transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our gross margins.Risks associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries, including failure of our vendors to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct, could harm our business.We purchase nearly all merchandise from third-party vendors in many different countries and we require those vendors to adhere to a Code of Vendor Conduct which includes environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. From time to time, contractors or their subcontractors may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable local laws. Although we have implemented policies and procedures to facilitate our compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise into various countries, there can be no assurance that suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more vendors could have a negative impact on our reputation, could subject us to liability, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain.Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States and other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type, or effect of any such restrictions. In addition, we face the possibility of anti-dumping or countervailing duties lawsuits from U.S. domestic producers. We are unable to determine the impact of the changes to the quota system or the impact that potential tariff lawsuits could have on our global sourcing operations. Our sourcing operations may be adversely affected by trade limits or political and financial instability, resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries, significant fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and/or other trade disruptions.7Our franchise business is subject to certain risks not directly within our control that could impair the value of our brands.We enter into franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate stores in many countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. The effect of these arrangements on our business and results of operations is uncertain and will depend upon various factors, including the demand for our products in new markets internationally and our ability to successfully identify appropriate third parties to act as franchisees, distributors, or in a similar capacity. In addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as franchisee financial stability and the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store locations, store openings, and sales. Other risks that may affect these third parties include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, foreign exchange rates, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and political instability. Moreover, while the agreements we have entered into and plan to enter into in the future provide us with certain termination rights, the value of our brands could be impaired to the extent that these third parties do not operate their stores in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.The market for prime real estate is competitive.Our ability to effectively obtain real estate - to open new stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices nationally and internationally - depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics, and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases. In addition, from time to time, we may seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition, or close some of our real estate locations, which in most cases requires a modification of an existing store lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Additionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties within the United States and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and the quality of our decisions to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We experience fluctuations in our comparable sales and margins.Our success depends in part on our ability to improve sales, in particular at our largest brands. A variety of factors affect comparable sales or margins, including apparel trends, competition, current economic conditions, the timing of new merchandise releases and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs, foreign currency fluctuations, and weather conditions. These factors may cause our comparable sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations. Our comparable sales, including the associated comparable online sales, have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual, quarterly, and monthly basis. Over the past 24 months, our reported monthly comparable sales have ranged from an increase of 10 percent in July 2012 to a decrease of 3 percent in September 2013. Over the past five years, our reported gross margins have ranged from a high of 40.3 percent in fiscal 2009 to a low of 36.2 percent in fiscal 2011. In addition, over the past five years, our reported operating margins have ranged from a high of 13.4 percent in fiscal 2010 to a low of 9.9 percent in fiscal 2011.Our ability to deliver strong comparable sales results and margins depends in large part on accurately forecasting demand and apparel trends, selecting effective marketing techniques, providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base, managing inventory effectively, using effective pricing strategies, and optimizing store performance. Failure to meet the expectations of investors, securities analysts, or credit rating agencies in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of our common stock and cause our credit ratings to decline.8Changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the capital markets and adversely impact our financial results or our business initiatives.In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, given favorable market conditions and our history of generating consistent and strong operating cash flow, we made the strategic decision to issue debt. In April 2011, we issued $1.25 billion  aggregate principal amount of 5.95 percent notes due April 12, 2021. As a result, we have additional costs that include interest payable semiannually on the notes. We also entered into a 15 billion Japanese yen ($147 million as of February 1, 2014), four-year term loan due January 2018.Our cash flows from operations are the primary source of funds for these debt service payments. In this regard, we have generated annual cash flow from operations in excess of $1 billion per year for the past decade and ended fiscal 2013 with $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. We are also able to supplement near-term liquidity, if necessary, with our $500 million revolving credit facility. We continue to target a cash balance of about $1.2 billion, which provides not only for our working capital needs, but also a reserve for unexpected business downturns. However, if our cash flows from operations decline significantly, we may be required to reprioritize our business initiatives to ensure that we can continue to service or refinance our debt with favorable rates and terms. In addition, any future reduction in our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets and higher interest costs on future financings.We remain committed to maintaining a strong financial profile with ample liquidity.For further information on our debt and credit facilities, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes 5 and 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.The failure to attract and retain key personnel could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing apparel trends depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel in our design, merchandising, marketing, and other functions. In addition, several of our strategic initiatives, including our technology initiatives and supply chain initiatives require that we hire and/or develop employees with appropriate experience. Competition for this personnel is intense, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods. If we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate talented employees with the appropriate skill sets, or if changes to our organizational structure, operating results, or business model adversely affect morale or retention, we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor to a key role in our senior management positions could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our investments in omni-channel shopping initiatives may not deliver the results we anticipate.One of our strategic priorities is to further develop an omni-channel shopping experience for our customers through the integration of our store and digital shopping channels. Examples of our recent omni-channel initiatives include our ship-from-store and reserve-in-store programs, in which store inventory can be used to satisfy online demand. We continue to explore additional ways to develop an omni-channel shopping experience, including further digital integration and customer personalization. These initiatives involve significant investments in IT systems and significant operational changes. In addition, our competitors are also investing in omni-channel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives. If the implementation of our omni-channel initiatives is not successful, or we do not realize the return on our omni-channel investments that we anticipate, our operating results would be adversely affected. 9Updates or changes to our IT systems may disrupt operations.We continue to evaluate and implement upgrades and changes to our IT systems, some of which are significant. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions, and believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks through testing, training, and staging implementation, as well as ensuring appropriate commercial contracts are in place with third-party vendors supplying or supporting our IT initiatives. However, there can be no assurances that we will successfully launch these systems as planned or that they will occur without disruptions to our operations. IT system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, or failure to successfully implement new or upgraded systems, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We are subject to data security risks, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and consumer confidence in our security measures.As part of our normal operations, we receive and maintain confidential information about our customers, our employees, and other third parties. Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, employees, job applicants, and others, including credit card information and personal identification information. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. Despite our safeguards and security processes and protections, we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our customers, or others who have entrusted us with information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. In addition, data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breach by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. Any compromise or breach of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of consumer confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.Our results could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, or other catastrophic events.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, and other adverse weather and climate conditions; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics; political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, and other political instability; or other catastrophic events, such as disasters occurring at our vendors' manufacturing facilities, whether occurring in the United States or internationally, could disrupt our operations, the operations of our franchisees, or the operations of one or more of our vendors. In particular, these types of events could impact our product supply chain from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability or the ability of our franchisees or other third parties to operate our stores or websites. In addition, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or depending upon the severity, globally. Disasters occurring at our vendors’ manufacturing facilities could impact our reputation and our customers’ perception of our brands. To the extent any of these events occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.10Changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Laws and regulations at the local, state, federal, and international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that may result from changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts employment and labor, trade, product safety, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, privacy, operations, or environmental issues, among others, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations"
8,GPS,GAP INC,2013-03-26,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.Our past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance because actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties discussed below. In addition, historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.Global economic conditions and the impact on consumer spending patterns could adversely impact our results of operations.The Company’s performance is subject to global economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending worldwide. Some of the factors influencing consumer spending include high levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on market declines and uncertainty, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, fluctuating interest rates and credit availability, government austerity measures, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty.Adverse economic changes in any of the regions in which we sell our products, could reduce consumer confidence, and thereby could negatively affect earnings and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  In a challenging and uncertain economic environment, we cannot predict whether or when such circumstances may improve or worsen, or what impact, if any, such circumstances could have on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.Our business is highly competitive.The global apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We compete with local, national, and global department stores, specialty and discount store chains, independent retail stores, and online businesses that market similar lines of merchandise. We face a variety of competitive challenges including:•anticipating and quickly responding to changing apparel trends and customer demands;•attracting customer traffic;•competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value;•maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to customers in several diverse market segments;•developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to customers of varying age groups and tastes;8Table of Contents•sourcing merchandise efficiently; and•providing strong and effective marketing support.In addition, our franchisees face significant competition in the markets in which they operate. If we or our franchisees are not able to compete successfully in the United States or internationally, our results of operations could be adversely affected.Furthermore, beginning in fiscal 2013, we will combine all channels and geographies under one global leader each for Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy. We do not have experience operating under this new global brand structure. If we are not successful in competing effectively under this structure, our results of operations could be adversely affected.We must successfully gauge apparel trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed.Our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our purchases are long, which may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing apparel trends or consumer acceptance of our products. The global apparel retail business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences, dictated in part by apparel trends and season. To the extent we misjudge the market for our merchandise or the products suitable for local markets or fail to execute trends and deliver product to market as timely as our competitors, our sales will be adversely affected, and the markdowns required to move the resulting excess inventory will adversely affect our operating results. Some of our past product offerings have not been well received by our broad and diverse customer base. Merchandise misjudgments could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing apparel trends depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel in our design, merchandising, marketing, and other functions in the context of our new global brand structure announced in October 2012. Competition for this personnel is intense, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods.Fluctuations in the global apparel retail business especially affect the inventory owned by apparel retailers, as merchandise usually must be ordered well in advance of the season and frequently before apparel trends are evidenced by customer purchases. In addition, the nature of the global apparel retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to the peak holiday selling season when we build up our inventory levels. We must enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. In the past, we have not always predicted our customers’ preferences and acceptance levels of our trend items with accuracy. If sales do not meet expectations, too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower than planned margins.Our business, including our costs and supply chain, is subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing.Independent third parties manufacture nearly all of our products for us. As a result, we are directly impacted by increases in the cost of those products. For example, cotton prices rose substantially during fiscal 2011, which put significant pressure on our average unit costs and gross margins.If we experience significant increases in demand or need to replace an existing vendor, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or that any vendor would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, for any new manufacturing source, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our vendors in our methods, products, quality control standards, and environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. Moreover, in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the manufacture of our products could result in lower sales and net income.Because independent vendors manufacture nearly all of our products outside of our principal sales markets, third parties must transport our products over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with transitioning between vendors, could adversely impact our financial performance. Manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as aircraft, which could adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, the cost of fuel is a significant component in transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our gross margins.9Table of ContentsOur efforts to expand internationally may not be successful.Our current strategies include moving to a global brand structure and pursuing continued international expansion in a number of countries around the world through a number of channels. Beginning in fiscal 2013, we will combine all channels and geographies under one global leader each for Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy. Each global brand president will oversee their brand's specialty, outlet, online, and franchise operations. We currently plan to open additional Old Navy stores outside of North America, open additional Gap stores in China, open additional international outlet stores, and continue to grow online sales internationally. We have limited experience operating in some of these locations. In many of these locations, we face major, established competitors. In addition, in many of these locations, the real estate, employment and labor, transportation and logistics, regulatory, and other operating requirements differ dramatically from those in the places where we have experience. Moreover, consumer tastes and trends may differ in many of these locations, and as a result, the sales of our products may not be successful or result in the margins we anticipate. In addition, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, profits, assets, and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Although we use instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our operations and financial results could be materially, adversely affected.Our franchise business is subject to certain risks not directly within our control and could impair the value of our brands.We enter into franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate stores in many countries around the world.

Other risks that may affect these third parties include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, foreign exchange, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, and political instability. Moreover, while the agreements we have entered into and plan to enter into in the future provide us with certain termination rights, the value of our brands could be impaired to the extent that these third parties do not operate their stores in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.The market for prime real estate is competitive.Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new stores nationally and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics, and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases. In addition, in recent years, we have been seeking to downsize, consolidate, reposition, or close some of our real estate locations, which in most cases requires a modification of an existing store lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Additionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of retail real estate properties within the United States and internationally.

A variety of factors affect comparable sales and margins, including apparel trends, competition, current economic conditions, the timing of new merchandise releases and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs, and weather conditions. These factors may cause our comparable sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations. Our comparable sales, including the associated comparable online sales, have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual, quarterly, and monthly basis. Over the past 24 months, our reported monthly comparable sales have ranged from an increase of 10 percent in July 2012 to a decrease of 10 percent in March 2011. Over the past five years, our reported gross margins have ranged from a high of 40.3 percent in fiscal 2009 to a low of 36.2 percent in fiscal 2011. In addition, over the past five years, our reported operating margins have ranged from a high of 13.4 percent in fiscal 2010 to a low of 9.9 percent in fiscal 2011.Our ability to deliver strong comparable sales results and margins depends in large part on accurately forecasting demand and apparel trends, selecting effective marketing techniques, providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base, managing inventory effectively, using effective pricing strategies, and optimizing store performance. Failure to meet the expectations of investors, securities analysts, or credit rating agencies in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of our common stock and cause our credit ratings to decline.Changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the capital markets and adversely impact our financial results or our business initiatives.In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, given favorable market conditions and our history of generating consistent and strong operating cash flow, we made the strategic decision to issue debt. In April 2011, we issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.95 percent notes due April 12, 2021. As a result, we have additional costs that include interest payable semiannually on the notes. We also entered into a $400 million five-year term loan due April 2016, which was funded in May 2011 and repaid in full in August 2012. Our cash flows from operations are the primary source of funds for these debt service payments. In this regard, we have generated annual cash flow from operations in excess of $1 billion per year for the past decade and ended fiscal 2012 with $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet. We are also able to supplement near-term liquidity, if necessary, with our $500 million revolving credit facility. We continue to target a cash balance of about $1.2 billion, which provides not only for our working capital needs, but also a reserve for unexpected business downturns. However, if our cash flows from operations decline significantly we may be required to reprioritize our business initiatives to ensure that we can continue to service or refinance our debt with favorable rates and terms. In addition, any future reduction in our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets and higher interest costs on future financings.We remain committed to maintaining a strong financial profile with ample liquidity. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes including share repurchases.For further information on our debt and credit facilities, see Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes 5 and 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain.Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States and other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type, or effect of any such restrictions. In addition, we face the possibility of anti-dumping or countervailing duties lawsuits from U.S. domestic producers. We are unable to determine the impact of the changes to the quota system or the impact that potential tariff lawsuits could have on our global sourcing operations. Our sourcing operations may be adversely affected by trade limits or political and financial instability, resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries, significant fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and/or other trade disruptions.11Table of ContentsUpdates or changes to our IT systems may disrupt operations.We continue to evaluate and implement upgrades and changes to our IT systems, some of which are significant. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions, and believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks through testing, training, and staging implementation, as well as ensuring appropriate commercial contracts are in place with third-party vendors supplying or supporting our IT initiatives. However, there can be no assurances that we will successfully launch these systems as planned or that they will occur without disruptions to our operations. IT system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, or failure to successfully implement new or upgraded systems, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Our IT services agreement with IBM could cause disruptions in our operations and have an adverse effect on our financial results.We have entered into the eighth year of a ten-year non-exclusive services agreement under which IBM operates certain significant aspects of our IT infrastructure. Under the original agreement, this included supporting our mainframe, server, network and data center, and store operations, as well as help desk, end user support, and some disaster recovery. Since the original agreement in January 2006, we have amended the agreement to take back certain services originally performed by IBM. These returned services include services related to management of our server and data center environment, along with disaster recovery, circuit expense billing, database administration services, and help desk services for stores worldwide. All other services remain with IBM per the original agreement. Our ability to realize the expected benefits of this arrangement is subject to various risks, some of which are not within our complete control. These risks include, but are not limited to, disruption in services and the failure to protect the security and integrity of the Company’s data under the terms of the agreement. We are unable to provide assurances that some or all of these risks will not occur. Failure to effectively mitigate these risks, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.We are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, employees, job applicants, and others, including credit card information and personal identification information. Security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks.

In addition, data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breach by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. Any compromise or breach of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.Our results could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, or other catastrophic events.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, and other adverse weather and climate conditions; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics; political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, and other political instability; or other catastrophic events, whether occurring in the United States or internationally, could disrupt our operations, the operations of our franchisees, or the operations of one or more of our vendors. In particular, these types of events could impact our product supply chain from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability or the ability of our franchisees or other third parties to operate our stores or websites. In addition, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or depending upon the severity, globally. To the extent any of these events occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.12Table of ContentsFailure of our vendors to adhere to our code of vendor conduct could harm our business.We purchase nearly all merchandise from third-party vendors outside of the United States and we require those vendors to adhere to a code of vendor conduct and other environmental, labor, health, and safety standards for the benefit of their workers. From time to time, contractors or their subcontractors may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable local laws. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could have a negative impact on our reputation and an adverse effect on our results of operations.Changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Laws and regulations at the local, state, federal, and international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. In addition, we cannot predict the impact that may result from changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts employment and labor, trade, product safety, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, privacy, operations, or environmental issues, among others, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations"

.  Our past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance because actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the risksand uncertainties discussed below. In addition, historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.   9 Table of ContentsGeneral economic conditions and the impact on consumer spending patterns could adversely impact ourresults of operations.  The Companys performance is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending.Some of the factors influencing consumer spending include fluctuating interest rates and credit availability, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, higher levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels,reductions in net worth based on market declines, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise,generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty, and such conditions could adversely impact our results of operations.  Our business is highly competitive.  The global specialty apparel retail industry is highlycompetitive. We compete with local, national, and global department stores, specialty and discount store chains, independent retail stores, and online businesses that market similar lines of merchandise. We face a variety of competitive challengesincluding:     attracting consumer traffic;     sourcing merchandise efficiently;     competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value;    anticipating and quickly responding to changing fashion trends and consumer demands;    maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to consumers in several diverse market segments;    developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to consumers of varying age groups and tastes; and    providing strong and effective marketing support.  In addition, our franchisees face significant competition in the markets in which they operate. If we or our franchisees are not able to compete successfully in the United States or internationally, our results ofoperations could be adversely affected.  We must successfully gauge fashion trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed. Our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the fashion tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customerdemand in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our purchases are long, which may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing fashion trends or consumer acceptance of our products. In addition, the competitivelandscape requires that more merchandise be produced through faster pipeline channels. The global specialty retail business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences, dictated in part by fashion and season. To the extent we misjudgethe market for our merchandise or the products suitable for local markets or fail to execute trends and deliver product to market as timely as our competitors, our sales will be adversely affected, and the markdowns required to move the resultingexcess inventory will adversely affect our operating results. Some of our past product offerings have not been well received by our broad and diverse customer base. Merchandise misjudgments could have a material adverse effect on our operatingresults.  Our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing fashion trends depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnelin our design, merchandising, marketing, and other functions. Competition for this personnel is intense, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods.  10       GAP INC. FORM 10-K Table of ContentsFluctuations in the global specialty retail business especially affect the inventory owned by apparel retailers, asmerchandise usually must be ordered well in advance of the season and frequently before fashion trends are evidenced by customer purchases. In addition, the cyclical nature of the global specialty retail business requires us to carry a significantamount of inventory, especially prior to the peak holiday selling season when we build up our inventory levels. We must enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season. As aresult, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. In the past, we have not always predicted our customers preferences and acceptance levels of our fashion items withaccuracy. If sales do not meet expectations, too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns, and therefore, lower than planned margins. Our products are subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing, including increased product costs. Independent third parties manufacture nearly all of our products for us. As a result, we are directly impacted by increases in the cost of those products. For example, cotton prices have risen substantially since the beginning of fiscal 2010, and we expect them to continue to rise in fiscal 2011. The currentincreases in commodity prices, specifically cotton, may put pressure on our average unit costs and may impact our gross margins. If we experiencesignificant increases in demand or need to replace an existing vendor, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or that any vendor would allocate sufficientcapacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, for any new manufacturing source, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our vendors in our methods, products, quality controlstandards, and environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. Moreover, in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, our vendors might not be ableto locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the manufacture of our products could result in lower sales and net income. Because independent vendors manufacture nearly all of our products outside of our principal sales markets, third parties must transport our products over largegeographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with transitioning betweenvendors, could adversely impact our financial performance. Manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as aircraft, which could adversely affect our grossmargins. In addition, the cost of fuel is a significant component in transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our gross margins.  Our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful and could impair the value of our brands. Our current strategies include international expansion in a number of countries around the world through a number of channels and brands. For example, we currentlyplan to open additional Gap stores in Europe and China, expand Banana Republic in Europe, open additional outlet stores in Canada, Europe, and Asia, and grow online sales internationally. We have limited experience operating in a number of thesecountries. In many of these countries, we face major, established competitors. In addition, in many of these countries, the real estate, employment and labor, transportation and logistics, and other operating requirements differ dramatically fromthose in the places where we have experience. Moreover, consumer tastes and trends may differ in many of these countries, and as a result, the sales of our products may not be successful or result in the margins we anticipate. If our internationalexpansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our operations and financial results could be materially, adversely affected.  We also have entered into franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate stores in many countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sellapparel and related products under our brand names. However, prior to fiscal 2006, we had no experience operating through these types of third-party arrangements, and we can provide no assurance that these arrangements will be successful. The effectof these arrangements on our business and results of operations is uncertain and will   11 Table of Contentsdepend upon various factors, including the demand for our products in new markets internationally and our ability to successfully identify appropriate third parties to act as franchisees,distributors, or in a similar capacity. In addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store locations, store openings, andsales. Other risks that may affect these third parties include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, and political instability. Moreover, while the agreements we have enteredinto and plan to enter into in the future provide us with certain termination rights, the value of our brands could be impaired to the extent that these third parties do not operate their stores in a manner consistent with our requirements regardingour brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation. The market for prime real estate is competitive. Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new stores nationally and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteriafor traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics, and other factors, including our ability to negotiate terms that meet our financial targets. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases. In addition,in recent years, we have been seeking to downsize, consolidate, reposition, or close some of our real estate locations, which in most cases requires a modification of an existing store lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfullymodify existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Additionally, the current economic environment may make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of retail real estate properties within the United States and internationally. This could impact the quality ofour decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and the quality of our decisions to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estatelocations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  We experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales and margins.  Our success depends in part onour ability to improve sales, in particular at our largest brands. A variety of factors affect comparable store sales, including fashion trends, competition, current economic conditions, the timing of new merchandise releases and promotional events,changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs, and weather conditions. These factors may cause our comparable store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations. Our comparable store sales havefluctuated significantly in the past on an annual, quarterly, and monthly basis as demonstrated by a decrease of 12 percent in fiscal 2008, a decrease of 3 percent in fiscal 2009, and an increase of 1 percent in fiscal 2010. Over the past fiveyears, our reported gross margins have ranged from a high of 40 percent in fiscal 2009 to a low of 36 percent in fiscal 2006. In addition, over the past five years, our reported operating margins have ranged from a high of 13 percent in fiscal 2010to a low of 8 percent in fiscal 2006.  Our ability to deliver strong comparable store sales results and margins depends in large part on accuratelyforecasting demand and fashion trends, selecting effective marketing techniques, providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base, managing inventory effectively, using effective pricing strategies, and optimizingstore performance. Failure to meet the expectations of investors, securities analysts, or credit rating agencies in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of our common stock and cause our credit ratings to decline. Changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the capital markets. Although we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with future cash flow from our operations will be adequate to satisfy our business operationsneeds for the foreseeable future, we may require additional cash for unexpected contingencies.  12       GAP INC. FORM 10-K Table of ContentsThere can be no assurance that our current levels of liquidity will continue or that our ability to access the creditor capital markets will not be adversely affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy.  Any future reduction in our long-termsenior unsecured credit rating could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets and higher interest costs on future financings.  As ofJanuary 29, 2011, the Company had $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.  For further information on our creditfacilities, see the section entitled Credit Facilities in our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included as Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain.  Traderestrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply ofapparel available to us and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will besubject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. and other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type, or effect of any such restrictions. In addition, we face the possibility of anti-dumping or countervailing duties lawsuitsfrom U.S. domestic producers. We are unable to determine the impact of the changes to the quota system or the impact that potential tariff lawsuits could have on our global sourcing operations. Our sourcing operations may be adversely affected bytrade limits or political and financial instability, resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries, significant fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and/orother trade disruptions.  Updates or changes to our IT systems may disrupt operations. We continue to evaluate and implement upgrades to our IT systems. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existingsystems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions, and believe we are taking appropriateaction to mitigate the risks through testing, training, and staging implementation, as well as ensuring appropriate commercial contracts are in place with third-party vendors supplying such replacement technologies. However, there can be noassurances that we will successfully launch these systems as planned or that they will occur without disruptions to our operations. IT system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, or failure to successfully implement newor upgraded systems, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Our IT services agreement with IBM could causedisruptions in our operations and have an adverse effect on our financial results.  We have entered into the sixth year of a ten-year non-exclusiveservices agreement with International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) under which IBM operates certain significant aspects of our IT infrastructure. Under the original agreement, this included supporting our mainframe, server,network and data center, and store operations, as well as help desk, end user support, and some disaster recovery. The agreement was amended effective March 2, 2009 to return to us certain services originally performed by IBM under theagreement. These returned services include services related to management of our server and data center environment, along with disaster recovery. All other services remain with IBM per the original agreement. Our ability to realize the expectedbenefits of this arrangement is subject to various risks, some of which are not within our complete control. These risks include, but are not limited to, disruption in services and the failure to protect the security and integrity of theCompanys data under the terms of the agreement. We are unable to provide assurances that some or all of these risks will not occur. Failure to effectively mitigate these risks, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on ouroperations and financial results.   13 Table of ContentsFailure of our vendors to adhere to our code of vendor conduct could harm our business.

Our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful and could impair the value of our brands. Our current strategies include international expansion in a number of countries around the world through a number of channels and brands. Forexample, we currently plan to open additional Gap stores in Europe and our first Gap stores in China, expand Banana Republic in Europe, open additional outlet stores in Canada, Europe, and  10      GAP INC. FORM 10-KTable of Contents  Asia, and begin offering online sales internationally, including in Canada and a number of European countries. We do not have any experience operating in a number of these countries, and we haveno experience offering online sales internationally. In many of these countries, we face major, established competitors. In addition, in many of these countries, the real estate, employment and labor, transportation and logistics, and otheroperating requirements differ dramatically from those in the places where we have experience. Moreover, consumer tastes and trends may differ in many of these countries, and as a result, the sales of our products may not be successful or result inthe margins we anticipate. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our operations and financial results could be materially, adversely affected.  We also have entered into franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate stores in many countries around the world. Under these agreements, thirdparties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel purchased from us under our brand names. Prior to fiscal 2006, we had no experience operating through these types of third-party arrangements, and we can provide no assurance that thesearrangements will be successful. While we expect this will continue to be a small part of our business in the near future, we plan over time to continue increasing these types of arrangements as part of our efforts to expand internationally. Theeffect of these arrangements on our business and results of operations is uncertain and will depend upon various factors, including the demand for our products in new markets internationally and our ability to successfully identify appropriate thirdparties to act as franchisees, distributors, or in a similar capacity. In addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding storelocations, store openings, and sales. Other risks that may affect these third parties include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, and political instability. Moreover, while theagreements we have entered into and plan to enter into in the future provide us with certain termination rights, the value of our brands could be impaired to the extent that these third parties do not operate their stores in a manner consistent withour requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and ourreputation.  Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing.  The current unfavorable economic conditions, including reduced ability to access credit, is having an adverse impact on businesses around the world, and its impact onour vendors cannot be predicted. Vendors reduced ability to access sources of capital could lead to their failure to deliver merchandise and could reduce the supply of apparel available to us, which could adversely affect our business,financial condition, and results of operations.  Independent third parties manufacture nearly all of our products for us. If we experience significantincreases in demand or need to replace an existing vendor, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any vendor would allocate sufficientcapacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our vendors inour methods, products, quality control standards, and environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. Moreover, in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of ourproducts, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the manufacture of our products could have an adverseeffect on our ability to meet consumer demand for our products and result in lower sales and net income.  Because independent vendors manufacture nearlyall of our products outside of our principal sales markets, third parties must transport our products over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, portstrikes, infrastructure congestion, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with transitioning between vendors, could adversely impact our financial performance. Manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us touse faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as aircraft, which could adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, the cost of fuel is a significant component in transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleumproducts can adversely affect our gross margins.   11 Table of Contents  Failure of our vendors toadhere to our code of vendor conduct could harm our business.  We purchase nearly all merchandise from third-party vendors outside of the UnitedStates and require those vendors to adhere to a code of vendor conduct and other environmental, labor, health, and safety standards for the benefit of workers. From time to time, contractors may not be in compliance with these standards orapplicable local laws. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could have a negative impact on our reputation and an adverse effect on our results of operations.  Changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  Laws and regulations at the state, federal, and international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. In addition,we cannot predict the impact that may result from changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impactsemployment and labor, trade, product safety, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, privacy, or environmental issues, among others, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations"

.  Our past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance because actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety offactors, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties discussed below. In addition, historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.  The recent changes in general economic conditions, and the impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, could adversely impact our results of operations.  The Companys performance is subject to general economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer confidence and consumer spending. Recently, consumer confidence andconsumer spending have deteriorated   7 Table of Contents  significantly, and could remain depressed for an extended period. Some of the factors influencing this deterioration include fluctuating interest rates and creditavailability, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, higher levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on market declines, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, andgeneral uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or there is economicuncertainty, and this has recently adversely impacted, and could in the future adversely impact, our results of operations.  Our business is highlycompetitive and depends on consumer spending patterns.  The global specialty apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We compete with national and localdepartment stores, specialty and discount store chains, independent retail stores and online businesses that market similar lines of merchandise. We face a variety of competitive challenges including:     attracting consumer traffic;     sourcing merchandise efficiently;     competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value;     anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands;     maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to consumers in several diverse market segments;     developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors and styles that appeal to consumers of varying age groups and tastes; and     providing strong and effective marketing support.  Our business issensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending, including political and economic conditions such as recessionary environments, levels of employment, levels of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interestrates, and consumer confidence. Declines in consumer confidence and spending on apparel and accessories could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.  We are also faced with competition in European, Japanese, and Canadian markets from established regional and national chains, and our franchisees face significant competition in the markets in which they operate. If our internationalbusiness is not successful or if we cannot effectively take advantage of international growth opportunities, our results of operations could be adversely affected.  The market for prime real estate is competitive.  Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new stores depends upon the availability ofreal estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics, and other factors, including our ability to negotiate terms that meet our financial targets. In addition, we must be able to effectivelyrenew our existing store leases. Failure to secure real estate locations adequate to meet annual targets, as well as effectively managing the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, could have a material adverse effect on our results ofoperations.  Additionally, the current economic environment may make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of retail real estate properties within the UnitedStates and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents, and the quality of our decisions to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality ofthese decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet annual targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  8      GAP INC. FORM 10-K Table of Contents  We must successfully gauge fashion trendsand changing consumer preferences to succeed.  Our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the fashion tastes of our customers and to providemerchandise that satisfies customer demand in a timely manner. The global specialty retail business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences dictated, in part, by fashion and season. To the extent we misjudge the market for ourmerchandise or the products suitable for local markets, our sales will be adversely affected and the markdowns required to move the resulting excess inventory will adversely affect our operating results. Some of our past product offerings have notbeen well received by our broad and diverse customer base. Merchandise misjudgments could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.  Our ability toanticipate and effectively respond to changing fashion trends depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel in our design, merchandising, marketing, and other functions. Competition for this personnel is intense, and we cannotbe sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods.  Fluctuations in the global specialty retail businessespecially affect the inventory owned by apparel retailers, since merchandise usually must be ordered well in advance of the season and frequently before fashion trends are evidenced by customer purchases. In addition, the cyclical nature of theglobal specialty retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to the peak holiday selling season when we build up our inventory levels. We must enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture ofmerchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. In the past, we have not always predicted our customerspreferences and acceptance levels of our fashion items with accuracy. In addition, lead times for many of our purchases are long, which may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing fashion trends or consumer acceptance forour products. If sales do not meet expectations, too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower than planned margins.  Weexperience fluctuations in our comparable store sales and margins.  Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to improve sales. A variety of factors affectcomparable store sales, including fashion trends, competition, current economic conditions, the timing of release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs, and weather conditions.These factors may cause our comparable store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations. Our comparable store sales have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual, quarterly and monthly basis. More recently,over the past three years, our comparable store sales figures have been negative year over year as demonstrated by a decrease of seven percent in fiscal 2006, a decrease of four percent in fiscal 2007, and a decrease of twelve percent in fiscal2008. Over the past five years, our reported gross margins have ranged from a high of 39 percent in fiscal 2004 to a low of 36 percent in fiscal 2006. In addition, over the past five years, our reported operating margins have ranged from a high oftwelve percent in fiscal 2004 to a low of eight percent in fiscal 2006.  Our ability to deliver strong comparable store sales results and margins depends, in largepart, on accurately forecasting demand and fashion trends, selecting effective marketing techniques, providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base, managing inventory effectively, using effective pricingstrategies, and optimizing store performance. Failure to meet the expectations of investors, security analysts, or credit rating agencies in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of our common stock and cause our credit ratings todecline.  Changes in our credit profile or further deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the capital markets.  Although we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents combined with future cash flow from our operations will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeablefuture, we may require additional cash for unexpected contingencies.   9 Table of Contents  The current unfavorable financial market conditionshave resulted in diminished availability of external funding and increased the related costs. There can be no assurance that our current levels of liquidity will continue or that our ability to access the credit or capital markets will not beadversely affected by changes in the financial markets and the global economy.  Due to our long-term credit ratings, we do not have meaningful access to thecommercial paper market. Any future reduction in our long-term senior unsecured credit rating could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets and higher interest costs on future financings.  We repaid our $50 million, 6.25 percent notes payable in March 2009. The Company now has no debt. As a result, Moodys has withdrawn its credit ratings. As of January 31,2009, the Company had $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash.  For further information on our debt and credit facilities see the sectionsentitled Debt and Credit Facilities in our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included as Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.  Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain.  Trade restrictions, includingincreased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us andadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional traderestrictions imposed by the U.S. and other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type or effect of any such restrictions. For example, the quota system established by the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing was phased out for World TradeOrganization countries and the U.S.-China textile and apparel agreement expired on December 31, 2008, but there are no assurances that additional restrictions will not be reestablished for certain categories in specific countries. Moreover,with the disappearance of quotas, the possibility of anti-dumping or countervailing duties lawsuits from U.S. domestic producers against importers increases. We are unable to determine the impact of the changes to the quota system or the impact thatpotential tariff lawsuits could have on our global sourcing operations. Our sourcing operations may be adversely affected by trade limits or political and financial instability resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries,significant fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and/or other trade disruptions.  Updates or changes to our IT systems may disrupt operations.  We continue to evaluate and implement upgrades to our IT systems. Upgrades involvereplacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accuratelycapturing data and system disruptions, and believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks through testing, training, and staging implementation as well as ensuring appropriate commercial contracts with third-party vendors supplyingsuch replacement technologies are in place. Although we are on track with the replacement or upgrade of our systems, there can be no assurances that we will successfully launch these systems as planned or that they will occur without disruptions toour operations. IT system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Our IT services agreement with IBM could cause disruptions in our operations and have an adverse effect on our financial results.  We have enteredinto the fourth year of a ten-year non-exclusive services agreement with IBM under which IBM operates certain significant aspects of our information technology infrastructure. Under the original agreement, this included supporting our mainframe,server, network and data center, and store operations, as well as help desk, end user support, and some disaster recovery. The agreement was amended effective March 2, 2009 to return to us certain services originally performed by IBM under theagreement. These returned services include services related to management of our server and data center environment, along with disaster recovery. All other   10      GAP INC. FORM 10-K Table of Contents  services remain with IBM per the original agreement. Our ability to realize the expected benefits of this arrangement is subject to various risks, some of which arenot within our complete control. These risks include, but are not limited to, disruption in services, and the failure to protect the security and integrity of the Companys data under the terms of the agreement. We are unable to provideassurances that some or all of these risks will not occur. Failure to effectively mitigate these risks if they occur could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.  Our efforts to expand internationally through franchising and similar arrangements may not be successful and could impair the value of our brands.  We have entered into franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate stores in many countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or willoperate, stores that sell apparel, purchased from us, under our brand names. Prior to fiscal 2006, we had no experience operating through these types of third-party arrangements, and we can provide no assurance that these arrangements will besuccessful. While we expect that this will be a small part of our business in the near future, we plan to continue to increase these types of arrangements over time as part of our efforts to expand internationally. The effect of these arrangementson our business and results of operations is uncertain and will depend upon various factors, including the demand for our products in new markets internationally and our ability to successfully identify appropriate third parties to act asfranchisees, distributors, or in a similar capacity. In addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales.Other risks that may affect these third parties include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, and political instability. Moreover, while the agreements we have entered into andplan to enter into in the future provide us with certain termination rights, to the extent that these third parties do not operate their stores in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experiencestandards, the value of our brands could be impaired. A failure to protect the value of our brands or any other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.  Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing.  The current unfavorable economic conditions, including the reduced ability to access credit, is having an adverse impact on businesses around the world, and its impact on our vendors cannot be predicted. Vendors reduced ability toaccess sources of capital could lead to their failure to deliver merchandise and could reduce the supply of apparel available to us, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Independent third parties manufacture nearly all of our products for us. If we experience significant increases in demand, or need to replace an existing vendor, there can be noassurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any vendor would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if weare able to expand existing or find new manufacturing sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our vendors in our methods, products, quality control standards, and environmental, labor,health, and safety standards. Moreover, in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers ofmaterials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet consumer demand for our products and result inlower sales and net earnings.  Because independent vendors manufacture nearly all of our products outside of our principal sales markets, our products must betransported by third parties over large geographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion, or other factors, and costs anddelays associated with transitioning between vendors, could adversely impact our financial performance. Manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such asaircraft, which could adversely affect our profit margins. In addition, the cost of fuel is a significant component in transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins.   11 Table of Contents  Failure of our vendors to adhere to ourcode of vendor conduct could harm our business.

To the extent we misjudge the market for ourmerchandise or the products suitable for local markets, our sales will be adversely affected and the markdowns required to move the resulting excess inventory will adversely affect our operating results. Some of our past product offerings have notbeen well received by our broad and diverse customer base. Merchandise misjudgments could have a material adverse effect on our image with our customers and on our operating results.  Our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing fashion trends depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel in ourdesign, merchandising, marketing and other functions. Competition for this personnel is intense, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods.  Fluctuations in the global specialty retail business especially affect the inventory owned by apparel retailers, since merchandise usually must beordered well in advance of the season and frequently before fashion trends are evidenced by customer purchases. In addition, the cyclical nature of the global specialty retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory,especially prior to peak Back-to-School and Holiday selling seasons when we build up our inventory levels. We must enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season. As a result, weare vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. In the past, we have not always predicted our customers preferences and acceptance levels of our fashion items with accuracy. Inaddition, lead times for many of our purchases are long, which may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing fashion trends or consumer acceptance for our products. If sales do not meet expectations, too much inventory maycause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower than planned margins.  Our business is highly competitive and depends on consumerspending patterns.  The global specialty apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We compete with national and local departmentstores, specialty and discount store chains, independent retail stores and internet businesses that market similar lines of merchandise. We face a variety of competitive challenges including:      anticipating and quickly responding to changing consumer demands;      maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to consumers in several diverse market segments;   8 Table of Contents   developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors and styles that appeal to consumers of varying age groups and tastes;      sourcing merchandise efficiently;      competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value;      providing strong and effective marketing support; and      maintaining high levels of consumer traffic.  Our business is sensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending, including political and economic conditions such as recessionary environments, the levels of disposable consumer income, consumer debt,interest rates and consumer confidence. Declines in consumer spending on apparel and accessories could have an adverse effect on our operating results.  We are also faced with competition in European, Japanese and Canadian markets from established regional and national chains. Our success in these markets depends on determining a sustainable profit formula to buildbrand loyalty and gain market share in these especially challenging retail environments. If our international business is not successful or if we cannot effectively take advantage of international growth opportunities, our results of operationscould be adversely affected.  The market for prime real estate is competitive.  Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new stores depends upon the availability of real estate that meets our criteria, including traffic,square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics, and other factors, and our ability to negotiate terms that meet our financial targets. In addition, we must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases. Failure to secure realestate locations adequate to meet annual targets, as well as effectively managing the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  We experience fluctuations in our comparable store sales and margins.  Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to continue to further improve sales, as well as both gross margins and operating margins. Our comparablestore sales have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual, quarterly and monthly basis, and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future. For example, over the past three years, our quarterly comparable store sales haveranged from an increase of 7% in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2004 to a decrease of 9% in the first fiscal quarter of 2006. Our comparable store sales in fiscal 2006 decreased 7% from fiscal 2005. A variety of factors affect comparable storesales, including fashion trends, competition, current economic conditions, the timing of release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions. These factors maycause our comparable store sales results to differ materially from prior periods and from expectations. Over the past five years our reported gross margins have ranged from a low of 34% in fiscal 2002 to 38% in fiscal 2003 to a high of 39% in fiscal2004. In addition, over the past five years our reported operating margins have ranged from a low of 7% in fiscal 2002 to a high of 12% in fiscal 2004.  Our ability to deliver strong comparable store sales results and margins depends in large part on accurately forecasting demand and fashion trends, selecting effective marketing techniques, providing an appropriatemix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base, managing inventory effectively, using more effective pricing strategies, and optimizing store performance by closing under performing stores. Failure to meet the expectations of investors,security analysts or credit rating agencies in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of our common stock and cause our credit ratings to decline.   9 Table of ContentsChanges in our credit ratings may have a negative or positive impact on our financing costs andstructure in future periods.  In November 2001, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of debt securities at an originalannual interest rate of 8.80%, due December 15, 2008 (the Notes), of which only $138 million remained outstanding as of February 3, 2007. The interest rate payable on the Notes is subject to adjustment from time to time ifeither Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) or Standard & Poors Rating Service (Standard & Poors) reduces the rating ascribed to the Notes below Baa2, in the case of Moodys, orbelow BBB+, in the case of Standard & Poors. The interest rate on the Notes increases by 0.25% for each rating category downgrade by either rating agency. In addition, if Moodys or Standard & Poors subsequentlyincreases the rating ascribed to the Notes, the ongoing interest rate then payable on the Notes decreases by 0.25% for each rating category upgrade by either rating agency up to Baa2, in the case of Moodys, or BBB+, in the case ofStandard & Poors. In no event will the interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate payable on the Notes. As a result of changes to our long-term credit ratings, the interest rate payable by us on the Notes has variedfrom 8.80% to 10.55% per annum. The interest rate on the Notes as of January 29, 2006 was 9.55%. On November 17, 2006, Standard & Poors downgraded our long term credit rating to BB+ which increased the interest ratepayable on the Notes to 9.80% effective as of December 15, 2006. On February 5, 2007, Moodys downgraded our long term credit rating to Ba1 which will increase the interest rate payable on the Notes to 10.05% effective as ofJune 15, 2007. Given our current credit ratings, we do not have meaningful access to the commercial paper market. Any future reduction in our long-term senior unsecured credit rating could result in reduced access to the capital markets andhigher interest costs on future financings.  For further information on our credit rating including outlook see the section entitledDebt and Credit Facility in our Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included as Part II, Item 7.  Trade matters and IT systems changes may disrupt our supply chain.  We cannot predict whether any ofthe countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. and other foreign governments, including the likelihood, type or effect of anysuch restrictions. Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards and customs restrictions, against apparel items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages or boycotts, could increase the cost orreduce the supply of apparel available to us and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although the quota system established by the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing was completely phased out for World TradeOrganization countries effective January 1, 2005, there can be no assurances that restrictions will not be reestablished for certain categories in specific countries. We are unable to determine the impact of the changes to the quota system onour global sourcing operations, including China and Vietnam. Our sourcing operations may be adversely affected by trade limits or political and financial instability resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries, significantfluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, restrictions on the transfer of funds and/or other trade disruptions.  Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to source and distribute merchandise efficiently. We continue to evaluate and are currently implementing modifications and upgrades to our information technology systems supporting theproduct pipeline, including merchandise planning and inventory management. Modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems or making changes to legacy systems. We are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing andchanging these core systems, including accurately capturing data and possibly encountering supply chain disruptions, and believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks through testing, training and staging implementation as well asensuring appropriate commercial contracts are in place with third-party vendors supplying such replacement technologies. We have completed implementation of the Perpetual and Financial inventory system and have launched an initiative to replace ourmerchandise planning system, which will be rolled out in a phased approach over a two- to three-year   10 Table of Contentsperiod, starting in 2007. Although we are on track with the replacement of our systems, there can be no assurances that we will successfully launch these newsystems as planned or that they will occur without supply chain or other disruptions. Supply chain disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.  We are implementing certain other changes to our IT systems that may disrupt operations.  In addition to modifying and replacing our systems related to merchandise planning and inventory management, we continue to evaluate and implementupgrades to our information technology systems for point of sales (cash registers), real estate, finance and human resources. Upgrades involve replacing legacy systems with current and industry-accepted successor systems, making changes to legacysystems or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and system disruptions, and believe we are taking appropriateaction to mitigate the risks through testing, training and staging implementation as well as ensuring appropriate commercial contracts with third-party vendors supplying such replacement technologies are in place. The launch of these successorsystems will take place in a phased approach over an approximate five to six year period that began in 2002. In 2004 we completed installation of our new point of sales system in all of our domestic stores, implemented our global financial systems,and replaced our lease management systems. In 2005 we introduced a new online platform, completed implementation of our perpetual and financial inventory system and implemented a new human resources/payroll system. In late fiscal 2005, we enteredinto an agreement with International Business Machines Corporation (also see the following paragraph entitled Our IT services agreement with IBM could cause disruptions in our operations and an adverse effect on our financial results).Although we are on track with replacement of our systems, there can be no assurances that we will successfully launch the remaining systems as planned or that they will occur without disruptions to operations. Information technology systemdisruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.  Our IT servicesagreement with IBM could cause disruptions in our operations and an adverse effect on our financial results.  In January 2006, weentered into a non-exclusive services agreement with International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) under which IBM operates certain significant aspects of our information technology infrastructure that historically were operated byus, including technology services supporting our mainframe, server, network and data center, and store operations, as well as help desk, end user support, and some disaster recovery services. We started transitioning these services to IBM in March2006 and completed the transition in late July 2006. In the period immediately following the completion of transition we experienced some delayed response to normal technology operation issues. As a result, process and procedural changes were made,which resulted in stable technology operations environment and no disruption during the peak holiday period, but there is no guarantee that we will not experience additional disruptions in the future as a result of this transition. Under thisagreement, we expect to continue to enhance the capabilities of and level of service realized from our technology infrastructure, while reducing the costs associated with these functions over time. However, our ability to realize the expectedbenefits of this arrangement is subject to various risks, some of which are not within our complete control. These risks include the risk that IBM will not be able to provide the anticipated levels of service on an ongoing basis or as our businesschanges over time, and the risk that IBM will be unable to maintain the security and integrity of the Companys data under the terms of the agreement. In addition, although there are certain pricing protections built into the servicesagreement, there is a risk that our costs under this arrangement, including the amounts that we are obligated to pay IBM, will exceed the costs that we would have incurred if we had not entered into this arrangement. We are unable to provideassurances that some or all of these risks will not occur, in particular, because we do not have experience outsourcing these aspects of our technology infrastructure. Failure to effectively mitigate these risks if they occur could have a materialadverse effect on our operations and financial results.    11 Table of ContentsOur growth is dependent on strategy development.  Our ability to grow our existing brands and develop or identify new growth opportunities depends in part on our ability to appropriately identify, developand effectively execute strategies and initiatives. Failure to effectively identify, develop and execute strategies and initiatives may lead to increased operating costs without offsetting benefits and could have a material adverse effect on ourresults of operations.  Our efforts to expand internationally through franchising and similar arrangements may not be successful andcould impair the value of our brands.  We entered into franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate stores inSingapore, Malaysia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Indonesia, and Korea. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel, purchased from us, under our brand names. Prior to 2006, we hadno experience operating through these types of third party arrangements, and we can provide no assurance that these arrangements will be successful. While we expect that this will be a small part of our business in the near future, we plan tocontinue to increase the number of countries in which we enter into these types of arrangements over time as part of our efforts to expand internationally. The effect of these arrangements on our business and results of operations is uncertain andwill depend upon various factors, including the demand for our products in new markets internationally and our ability to successfully identify appropriate third parties to act as franchisees, distributors or in a similar capacity. In addition,certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly in our control, such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales. Moreover, while the agreements we have entered into and plan to enterinto in the future provide us with certain termination rights, to the extent that these third parties do not operate their stores in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards, thevalue of our brands could be impaired. Failure to successfully expand internationally through franchising or similar arrangements, or a failure to protect the value of our brands, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  "

  Our pastperformance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance because actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties discussed below. Inaddition, historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.  We must successfully gauge fashiontrends and changing consumer preferences to succeed.  Our success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the fashion tastes ofour customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand in a timely manner. The global specialty retail business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences dictated, in part, by fashion and season. To the extent wemisjudge the market for our merchandise or the products suitable for local markets, our sales will be adversely affected and the markdowns required to move the resulting excess inventory will adversely affect our operating results. Some of our pastproduct offerings have not been well received by our broad and diverse customer base. Merchandise misjudgments could have a material adverse effect on our image with our customers and on our operating results.  Our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to changing fashion trends depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel in ourdesign, merchandising, marketing and other functions.

Our comparable store sales have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual, quarterly and monthly basis, and we expect thatthey will continue to fluctuate in the future. For example, over the past three years, our quarterly comparable store sales have ranged from an increase of 12% in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2003 to a decrease of 7% in the third fiscalquarter of 2005. Our comparable store sales in fiscal 2005 decreased 5% from fiscal 2004.
