3,GIS,GENERAL MILLS INC,2023-06-28,"ITEM 1A - Risk Factors
 Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks described below could materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Business and Industry Risks  The categories in which we participate are very competitive, and if we arenot able to compete effectively, our results of operations could be adverselyaffected. The human and pet food categories in which we participate are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers, as well as retailers with their own branded and private label products. Competitors market and sell their products through brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce. All of our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. If our large competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or promotional changes, we could choose to do the same, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability. If we did not do the same, our revenues and market share could be adversely affected. Our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors. If we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products.  We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment. There has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry, resulting in customers with increased purchasing power. In addition, large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands, and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation, knowledge of consumers’ needs, and category leadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted. In addition, the loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits. In fiscal 2023, Walmart accounted for 21 percent of our consolidated net sales and 28 percent of net sales of our North America Retail segment. For more information on significant customers, please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.  Price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials, packaging,and energy may adversely affect our profitability. The principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather, climate change, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, trade tariffs, pandemics, war (including international sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine), and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. Commodity prices have become, and may continue to be, more volatile. Commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging, energy, and transportation costs. If we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices, we may experience reduced margins and profitability. We do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend.      9 Concerns with the safety and quality of our products could cause consumers toavoid certain products or ingredients. We could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain of our products or ingredients. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends,which may result in decreased demand for our products. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes, eating habits, and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences in channels where they shop. Consumer preferences and category-level consumption may change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors. If we fail to anticipate, identify or react to these changes and trends, such as adapting to emerging e-commerce channels, or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, we may experience reduced demand for our products, which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer. Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium, trans fats, genetically modified organisms, sugar, processed wheat, grain-free or legume-rich pet food, or other product ingredients or attributes.  We may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in fastergrowing and more profitable categories. The food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve. One way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories. Our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories. If we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected. Our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business. The value of our brands is based in large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, concerns about food safety, or our products becoming unavailable to consumers. Consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support. The use of social and digital media by consumers, us, and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our business results could be negatively impacted. Operating Risks If we are not efficient in our production, our profitability could suffer as aresult of the highly competitive environment in which we operate. Our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets. Gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position. Many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines. Such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production, which may negatively impact product volume and margins. We periodically engage in restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and reduce expenses. If we are unable to execute those initiatives as planned, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business. Our ability to make, move, and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, cyber-attack, pandemics, war, governmental restrictions or mandates, labor shortages, strikes, import/export restrictions, or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location or sourced from a single supplier. The failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who supply our ingredients, packaging, capital equipment and other necessary operating materials, contract manufacturers, commercial transport, distributors, contractors, and           10 external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, may negatively impact our operations. Our suppliers’ policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products. Disputes with significant suppliers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our sales, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single location or supplier, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.  Short term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain. Our failure to meet the demand for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  Our international operations are subject to political and economic risks. In fiscal 2023, 19 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the United States. We are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include:  ●political and economic instability; ●exchange controls and currency exchange rates; ●tariffs on products and ingredients that we import and export; ●nationalization or government control of operations; ●compliance with anti-corruption regulations; ●foreign tax treaties and policies; and ●restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences.  Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. From time to time, we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure.  A strengthening in the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in the countries in which we operate would negatively affect our reported results of operations and financial results due to currency translation losses and currency transaction losses. Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached. Information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information to manage a variety of business processes and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems and infrastructure are critical to effectively manage our key business processes including digital marketing, order entry and fulfillment, supply chain management, finance, administration, and other business processes. These technologies enable internal and external communication among our locations, employees, suppliers, customers, and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about our employees, consumers, and proprietary business information. Our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to damage, interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, security breaches, computer viruses, hackers, employee error or malfeasance, and other causes. Increased cyber-security threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on those systems. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, data loss, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory penalties, and the loss of sales and customers. Any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational, reputational, legal, and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business. Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results. From time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations. If we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions, our financial results could suffer. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage, the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities, the inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience, failure to achieve anticipated synergies, and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets.       11 Legal and Regulatory Risks If our products become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled, we mightneed to recall those items and may experience product liability claims ifconsumers or their pets are injured. We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. A significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands. New regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business. Our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the production, packaging, labelling, storage, distribution, quality, and safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees. Our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products. We advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. We may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products, including restrictions on the audience to whom products are marketed. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.  We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies. We are currently party to a variety of environmental remediation obligations. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation, and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours, the potential exists for remediation, liability, indemnification, and compliance costs to differ from our estimates. We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters, or compliance with environmental laws in general, will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Climate change and other sustainability matters could adversely affect our business. There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. If such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may experience decreased availability and higher pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products. Increased frequency or severity of extreme weather could also impair our production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain, impact demand for our products, and increase our insurance and other operating costs. Increasing concern over climate change or other sustainability issues also may adversely impact demand for our products due to changes in consumer preferences or negative consumer reaction to our commitments and actions to address these issues. We may also become subject to additional legal and regulatory requirements relating to climate change or other sustainability issues, including greenhouse gas emission regulations (e.g., carbon taxes), energy policies, sustainability initiatives (e.g., single-use plastic limits), and disclosure obligations. If additional legal and regulatory requirements are enacted and are more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to reduce our emissions and improve our energy efficiency and other sustainability goals, or if we chose to take actions to achieve more aggressive goals, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operations. We have announced goals and commitments to reduce our carbon footprint. If we fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our carbon emissions reduction goals and commitments, then the resulting negative publicity could harm our reputation and adversely affect demand for our products. Financial and Economic Risks Volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings. We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently, which may result in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocated corporate items outside our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating           12 profit. We also record our grain inventories at net realizable value. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments. Economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products. The willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions. In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may purchase more generic, private label, and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether. In those circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. In addition, as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions, we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins. Consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our North America Foodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends. As of May 28, 2023, we had total debt and noncontrolling interests of $12.0 billion. The agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness may limit our:  ●ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and ●flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions.  There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness, and other unrelated indebtedness, could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected.  Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, and other factors beyond our control. We depend on stable, liquid and well-functioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations. Our financial performance, our credit ratings, interest rates, the stability of financial institutions with which we partner, and the liquidity of the overall global capital markets could affect our access to, and the availability, terms and conditions, and cost of capital.  Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefitpension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit costs. We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada, and various foreign locations, including defined benefit pension, retiree health and welfare, severance, and other postemployment plans. Our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations.  A change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth. As of May 28, 2023, we had $21. 2 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We compare the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. If current expectations for growth rates for sales and profits are not met, or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions were to change, then our reporting units could become significantly impaired. While we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired, different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses.       13  We evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets, primarily intangible assets associated with the Blue Buffalo,Pillsbury, Totino’s, Old El Paso, Progresso, Annie’s, Nudges,and Häagen-Dazs brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.  Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. If current expectations for growth rates for sales and margins are not met, or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions were to change, then our indefinite-lived intangible assets could become significantly impaired. Our Progresso, EPIC, and Uncle Toby’s brands had risk of decreasing coverage and we continue to monitor these businesses.  For further information on goodwill and intangible assets, please refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report"
5,GIS,GENERAL MILLS INC,2022-06-30,"ITEM 1A - Risk Factors
 Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks described below could materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Business and Industry Risks  Global health developments and economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures being taken by governments, businesses, including us, and the public at large to limit COVID-19’s spread have had, and may continue to have, certain negative impacts on our business, financial condition, and results of operations including, without limitation, the following:  ●We have experienced, and may continue to experience, a decrease in sales of certain of our products in markets around the world that have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, sales of our products in the away-from-home food outlets across all our major markets have been negatively affected by reduced consumer traffic resulting from shelter-in-place regulations or recommendations and closings of restaurants, schools and cafeterias. If the COVID-19 pandemic persists or intensifies, its negative impacts on our sales, particularly in away-from-home food outlets, could be more prolonged and may become more severe. ●Deteriorating economic and political conditions in our major markets affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased unemployment, decreases in disposable income, declines in consumer confidence, or economic slowdowns or recessions, could cause a decrease in demand for our products. ●We have experienced minor temporary workforce disruptions in our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Illness, travel restrictions, absenteeism, or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, or other business processes. We may face additional production disruptions in the future, which may place constraints on our ability to produce products in a timely manner or may increase our costs. ●Changes and volatility in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns may increase demand for our products in one quarter, resulting in decreased consumer demand for our products in subsequent quarters. Short term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain. ●The failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who supply our ingredients, packaging, capital equipment and other necessary operating materials, contract manufacturers, commercial transport, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, and external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, may negatively impact our operations. ●Significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell, or distribute our products (including quarantines, import/export restrictions, price controls, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers, or customers from sufficiently staffing operations, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, and sale of our products) could adversely impact our operations and results. ●Actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in investigations, legal claims or litigation against us.  The categories in which we participate are very competitive, and if we arenot able to compete effectively, our results of operations could be adverselyaffected. The human and pet food categories in which we participate are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers, as well as retailers with their own branded and private label products. Competitors market and sell their products through brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce. All of our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other    9 resources. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. If our large competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or promotional changes, we could choose to do the same, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability. If we did not do the same, our revenues and market share could be adversely affected. Our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors. If we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products.  We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment. There has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry, resulting in customers with increased purchasing power. In addition, large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands, and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation, knowledge of consumers’ needs, and category leadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted. In addition, the loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits. In fiscal 2022, Walmart accounted for 20 percent of our consolidated net sales and 28 percent of net sales of our North America Retail segment. For more information on significant customers, please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.  Price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials, packaging,and energy may adversely affect our profitability. The principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather, climate change, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, trade tariffs, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), war (including international sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine), and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. Commodity prices have become, and may continue to be, more volatile during the COVID-19 pandemic. Commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging, energy, and transportation costs. If we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices, we may experience reduced margins and profitability. We do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend. Concerns with the safety and quality of our products could cause consumers toavoid certain products or ingredients. We could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain of our products or ingredients. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends,which may result in decreased demand for our products. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes, eating habits, and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences in channels where they shop. Consumer preferences and category-level consumption may change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors. If we fail to anticipate, identify or react to these changes and trends, such as adapting to emerging e-commerce channels, or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, we may experience reduced demand for our products, which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer. Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium, trans fats, genetically modified organisms, sugar, processed wheat, grain-free or legume-rich pet food, or other product ingredients or attributes.  We may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in fastergrowing and more profitable categories. The food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve. One way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories. Our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories. If we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected.     10 Our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business. The value of our brands is based in large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, concerns about food safety, or our products becoming unavailable to consumers. Consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support. The use of social and digital media by consumers, us, and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our business results could be negatively impacted. Operating Risks If we are not efficient in our production, our profitability could suffer as aresult of the highly competitive environment in which we operate. Our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets. Gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position. Many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines. Such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production, which may negatively impact product volume and margins. We periodically engage in restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and reduce expenses. If we are unable to execute those initiatives as planned, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business. Our ability to make, move, and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, cyber-attack, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), war, governmental restrictions or mandates, labor shortages, strikes, import/export restrictions, or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location or sourced from a single supplier. The failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who supply our ingredients, packaging, capital equipment and other necessary operating materials, contract manufacturers, commercial transport, distributors, contractors, and external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, may negatively impact our operations. Our suppliers’ policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products. Disputes with significant suppliers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our sales, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single location or supplier, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.  Short term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain. Our failure to meet the demand for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  Our international operations are subject to political and economic risks. In fiscal 2022, 23 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the United States. We are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include:  ●political and economic instability; ●exchange controls and currency exchange rates; ●tariffs on products and ingredients that we import and export; ●nationalization or government control of operations; ●compliance with anti-corruption regulations; ●foreign tax treaties and policies; and ●restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences.  Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British     11 pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. From time to time, we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure.  A strengthening in the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in the countries in which we operate would negatively affect our reported results of operations and financial results due to currency translation losses and currency transaction losses. Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached. Information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information to manage a variety of business processes and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems and infrastructure are critical to effectively manage our key business processes including digital marketing, order entry and fulfillment, supply chain management, finance, administration, and other business processes. These technologies enable internal and external communication among our locations, employees, suppliers, customers, and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about our employees, consumers, and proprietary business information. Our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to damage, interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, security breaches, computer viruses, hackers, employee error or malfeasance, and other causes. Increased cyber-security threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on those systems. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, data loss, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory penalties, and the loss of sales and customers. Any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational, reputational, legal, and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business. Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results. From time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations. If we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions, our financial results could suffer. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage, the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities, the inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience, failure to achieve anticipated synergies, and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets. Legal and Regulatory Risks If our products become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled, we mightneed to recall those items and may experience product liability claims ifconsumers or their pets are injured. We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. A significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands. New regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business. Our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the production, packaging, labelling, storage, distribution, quality, and safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees. Our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products. We advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. We may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products, including restrictions on the audience to whom products are marketed. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.  Significant COVID-19 related changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products (including quarantines, import/export restrictions, price controls, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions or otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers, or customers from sufficiently staffing operations, including     12 operations necessary for the production, distribution, sale, and support of our products) could adversely impact our operations and results.  We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies. We are currently party to a variety of environmental remediation obligations. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation, and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours, the potential exists for remediation, liability, indemnification, and compliance costs to differ from our estimates. We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters, or compliance with environmental laws in general, will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Climate change and other sustainability matters could adversely affect our business. There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the earth’s atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. If such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may experience decreased availability and higher pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products. Increased frequency or severity of extreme weather could also impair our production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain, impact demand for our products, and increase our insurance and other operating costs. Increasing concern over climate change or other sustainability issues also may adversely impact demand for our products due to changes in consumer preferences or negative consumer reaction to our commitments and actions to address these issues. We may also become subject to additional legal and regulatory requirements relating to climate change or other sustainability issues, including greenhouse gas emission regulations (e.g., carbon taxes), energy policies, sustainability initiatives (e.g., single-use plastic limits), and disclosure obligations. If additional legal and regulatory requirements are enacted and are more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency and other sustainability goals, or if we chose to take actions to achieve more aggressive goals, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operations. We have announced goals and commitments to reduce our carbon footprint. If we fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our carbon emissions reduction goals and commitments, then the resulting negative publicity could harm our reputation and adversely affect demand for our products. Financial and Economic Risks Volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings. We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently, resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocated corporate items outside our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit. We also record our grain inventories at net realizable value. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments. Economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products. The willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions. In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may purchase more generic, private label, and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether. In those circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. In addition, as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions, we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins. Consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our North America Foodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.      13 We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends. As of May 29, 2022, we had total debt and noncontrolling interests of $11.9 billion. The agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness may limit our:  ●ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and ●flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions.  There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness, and other unrelated indebtedness, could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected.  Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, and other factors beyond our control.  Global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity,increase our costs of borrowing, and disrupt the operations of our suppliersand customers. We depend on stable, liquid, and well-functioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations. Although we believe that our operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital and credit markets, and revolving credit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. We also utilize interest rate derivatives to reduce the volatility of our financing costs. If we are not effective in hedging this volatility, we may experience an increase in our costs of borrowing. Our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy.  We may not have access to preferred sources of liquidity when needed or on terms we find acceptable, and our borrowing costs could increase. An economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed. A disruption in the financial markets may have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners, on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties to our derivative contracts.  From time to time, we issue variable rate securities based on London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and enter into interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on LIBOR. The United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority intends to phase out the LIBOR rates associated with our outstanding variable rate securities and interest rate swaps by June 2023. The U.S. Federal Reserve has selected the Secured Overnight Funding Rate (SOFR) as the preferred alternate rate to LIBOR. We are planning for this transition and will amend any contracts to accommodate the SOFR rate where required. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of this transition, which remains subject to uncertainty.  Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefitpension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit costs. We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada, and various foreign locations, including defined benefit pension, retiree health and welfare, severance, and other postemployment plans. Our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations.  A change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth. As of May 29, 2022, we had $21.4 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We compare the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the     14 reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. If current expectations for growth rates for sales and profits are not met, or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions were to change, then our reporting units could become significantly impaired. While we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired, different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses.  We evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets, primarily intangible assets associated with the Blue Buffalo, Pillsbury, Totino’s, Progresso, Old El Paso, Yoki, Häagen-Dazs, and Annie’s brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.  Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. If current expectations for growth rates for sales and margins are not met, or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions were to change, then our indefinite-lived intangible assets could become significantly impaired. Our Progresso, Green Giant, EPIC, and Uncle Toby’s brands had experienced declining business performance, and we continue to monitor these businesses.  For further information on goodwill and intangible assets, please refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report"

 Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks described below could materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Business and Industry Risks Global health developments and economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures being taken by governments, businesses, including us, and the public at large to limit COVID-19’s spread have had, and we expect will continue to have, certain negative impacts on our business, financial condition, and results of operations including, without limitation, the following:  We have experienced, and may continue to experience, a decrease in sales of certain of our products in markets around the world that have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, sales of our products in the away-from-home food outlets across all our major markets have been negatively affected by reduced consumer traffic resulting from shelter-in-place regulations or recommendations and closings of restaurants, schools and cafeterias. If the COVID-19 pandemic persists or intensifies, its negative impacts on our sales, particularly in away-from-home food outlets, could be more prolonged and may become more severe. Deteriorating economic and political conditions in our major markets affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased unemployment, decreases in disposable income, declines in consumer confidence, or economic slowdowns or recessions, could cause a decrease in demand for our products. We have experienced minor temporary workforce disruptions in our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have implemented employee safety measures, based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization, across all our supply chain facilities, including proper hygiene, social distancing, mask use, and temperature screenings. These measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among our employees. Illness, travel restrictions, absenteeism, or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, or other business processes. We may face additional production disruptions in the future, which may place constraints on our ability to produce products in a timely manner or may increase our costs. Changes and volatility in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns may increase demand for our products in one quarter, resulting in decreased consumer demand for our products in subsequent quarters. Short term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain. The failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who supply our ingredients, packaging, capital equipment and other necessary operating materials, contract manufacturers, commercial transport, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, and external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, may negatively impact our operations.  Significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell, or distribute our products (including quarantines, import/export restrictions, price controls, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers, or customers from sufficiently staffing operations, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, and sale of our products) could adversely impact our operations and results. Actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in investigations, legal claims or litigation against us. The categories in which we participate are very competitive, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected. The consumer and pet food categories in which we participate are very competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories are manufacturers, as well as retailers with their own branded and private label products. Competitors market and sell their products through brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce. All of our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. If our large competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing or promotional changes, we could choose to do the same, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability. If we did not do the same, our revenues and market share could be adversely affected. Our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors. If we are unable to build and sustain9 brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products. We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment. There has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry, resulting in customers with increased purchasing power. In addition, large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands, and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation, knowledge of consumers’ needs, and category leadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted. In addition, the loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits. In fiscal 2021, Walmart accounted for 20 percent of our consolidated net sales and 29 percent of net sales of our North America Retail segment. For more information on significant customers, please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials, packaging, and energy may adversely affect our profitability. The principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather, climate change, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, trade tariffs, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. Commodity prices have become, and may continue to be, more volatile during the COVID-19 pandemic. Commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging, energy, and transportation costs. If we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices, we may experience reduced margins and profitability. We do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend.  Concerns with the safety and quality of our products could cause consumers to avoid certain products or ingredients. We could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain of our products or ingredients. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends, which may result in decreased demand for our products. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes, eating habits, and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences in channels where they shop. Consumer preferences and category-level consumption may change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors. If we fail to anticipate, identify or react to these changes and trends, such as adapting to emerging e-commerce channels, or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, we may experience reduced demand for our products, which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer. Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium, trans fats, genetically modified organisms, sugar, processed wheat, grain-free or legume-rich pet food, or other product ingredients or attributes. We may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories. The food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve. One way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories. Our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories. If we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected. Our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business. The value of our brands is based in large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, concerns about food safety, or our products becoming unavailable to consumers. Consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support. The use of social and digital media by consumers, us, and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and10 opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our business results could be negatively impacted. Operating Risks If we are not efficient in our production, our profitability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate. Our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets. Gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position. Many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines. Such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production, which may negatively impact product volume and margins. We periodically engage in restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and reduce expenses. If we are unable to execute those initiatives as planned, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business. Our ability to make, move, and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, cyber-attack, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), governmental restrictions or mandates, strikes, import/export restrictions, or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location or sourced from a single supplier. The failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who supply our ingredients, packaging, capital equipment and other necessary operating materials, contract manufacturers, commercial transport, distributors, contractors, and external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, may negatively impact our operations. Our suppliers’ policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products. Disputes with significant suppliers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our sales, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single location or supplier, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain. Short term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain. Our failure to meet the demand for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our international operations are subject to political and economic risks. In fiscal 2021, 26 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the United States. We are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include:  political and economic instability; exchange controls and currency exchange rates; tariffs on products and ingredients that we import and export; nationalization or government control of operations; compliance with anti-corruption regulations; uncertainty relating to the impact of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union; foreign tax treaties and policies; and restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences. Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. From time to time, we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure. A strengthening in the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in the countries in which we operate, such as has generally occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic to-date, would negatively affect our reported results of operations and financial results due to currency translation losses and currency transaction losses. 11 Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached. Information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information to manage a variety of business processes and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems and infrastructure are critical to effectively manage our key business processes including digital marketing, order entry and fulfillment, supply chain management, finance, administration, and other business processes. These technologies enable internal and external communication among our locations, employees, suppliers, customers, and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about our employees, consumers, and proprietary business information. Our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to damage, interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, security breaches, computer viruses, hackers, employee error or malfeasance, and other causes. Increased cyber-security threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on those systems. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, data loss, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory penalties, and the loss of sales and customers. Any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational, reputational, legal, and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business. Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results. From time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations. If we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions, our financial results could suffer. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage, the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities, the inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience, failure to achieve anticipated synergies, and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets. Legal and Regulatory Risks If our products become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled, we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers or their pets are injured. We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. A significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands. New regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business. Our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the production, packaging, labelling, storage, distribution, quality, and safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees. Our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products. We advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. We may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products, including restrictions on the audience to whom products are marketed. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected. Significant COVID-19 related changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products (including quarantines, import/export restrictions, price controls, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions or otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers, or customers from sufficiently staffing operations, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, sale, and support of our products) could adversely impact our operations and results. We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies. We are currently party to a variety of environmental remediation obligations. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation, and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours, the potential exists for remediation, liability, indemnification, and12 compliance costs to differ from our estimates. We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters, or compliance with environmental laws in general, will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Financial and Economic Risks Volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings. We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently, resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocated corporate items outside our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit. We also record our grain inventories at net realizable value. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments. Economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products. The willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions. In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may purchase more generic, private label, and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether. In those circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. In addition, as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions, we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins. Consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends. As of May 30, 2021, we had total debt, redeemable interests, and noncontrolling interests of $13.5 billion. The agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness may limit our:  ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions. There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness, and other unrelated indebtedness, could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, and other factors beyond our control. Global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing, and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers. We depend on stable, liquid, and well-functioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations. Although we believe that our operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital and credit markets, and revolving credit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. We also utilize interest rate derivatives to reduce the volatility of our financing costs. If we are not effective in hedging this volatility, we may experience an increase in our costs of borrowing. Our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets. We may not have access to preferred sources of liquidity when needed or on terms we find acceptable, and our borrowing costs could increase. An economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed. A disruption in the financial markets may have a13 negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners, on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties to our derivative contracts. From time to time, we issue variable rate securities based on interbank offered rates (IBORs) and enter into interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on an IBOR. There is currently uncertainty whether certain IBORs will continue to be available after 2021. If certain IBORs cease to be available, we may need to amend affected agreements, and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our counterparties and security holders. As a result, our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit costs. We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada, and various foreign locations, including defined benefit pension, retiree health and welfare, severance, and other postemployment plans. Our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations. A change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth. As of May 30, 2021, we had $20.7 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We compare the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. If current expectations for growth rates for sales and profits are not met, or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions that could be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise were to change, then our reporting units could become significantly impaired. Our Europe & Australia reporting unit had experienced declining business performance, and we continue to monitor this business. While we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired, different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses. We evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets, primarily intangible assets associated with the Blue Buffalo, Pillsbury, Totino’s, Progresso, Yoplait, Old El Paso, Yoki, Häagen-Dazs, and Annie’s brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. If current expectations for growth rates for sales and margins are not met, or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions that could be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise were to change, then our indefinite-lived intangible assets could become significantly impaired. Our Progresso, Green Giant, and EPIC brands had experienced declining business performance, and we continue to monitor these businesses. For further information on goodwill and intangible assets, please refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. "

While we experienced increased demand for our products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, this increase may moderate or reverse if consumers alter their purchasing habits. Short term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain. The failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who supply our ingredients, packaging, capital equipment and other necessary operating materials, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, and external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, may negatively impact our operations.8 Significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell, or distribute our products (including quarantines, import/export restrictions, price controls, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers, or customers from sufficiently staffing operations, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, and sale of our products) could adversely impact our operations and results.Actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in investigations, legal claims or litigation against us. The categories in which we participate are very competitive, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected. The consumer and pet food categories in which we participate are very competitive.

Our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors. If we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over generic and private label products. We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment. There has been significant consolidation in the grocery industry, resulting in customers with increased purchasing power. In addition, large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasis on generic and other economy brands, and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation, knowledge of consumers’ needs, and category leadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability and volume growth could be negatively impacted. In addition, the loss of any large customer could adversely affect our sales and profits. In fiscal 2020, Walmart accounted for 21 percent of our consolidated net sales and 30 percent of net sales of our North America Retail segment. For more information on significant customers, please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials, packaging, and energy may adversely affect our profitability. The principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather, climate change, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, trade tariffs, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. Commodity prices have become, and may continue to be, more volatile during the COVID-19 pandemic. Commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging, and energy costs. If we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices, we may experience reduced margins and profitability. We do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and the risk management procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend. Volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings. We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs, including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean), dairy products, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earnings currently, resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and losses are reported in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocated corporate items outside our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operating profit. We also record our grain inventories at net realizable value. We may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments. 9 If we are not efficient in our production, our profitability could suffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate. Our future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to be efficient in the production and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets. Gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions or divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position. Many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines. Such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production, which may negatively impact product volume and margins. We periodically engage in restructuring and cost savings initiatives designed to increase our efficiency and reduce expenses. If we are unable to execute those initiatives as planned, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business.  Our ability to make, move, and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, cyber-attack, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), governmental restrictions or mandates, strikes, import/export restrictions, or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location or sourced from a single supplier. The failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who supply our ingredients, packaging, capital equipment and other necessary operating materials, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, and external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, may negatively impact our operations. Our suppliers’ policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products. Disputes with significant suppliers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our sales, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single location or supplier, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain. We have experienced minor temporary workforce disruptions in our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have implemented employee safety measures, based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization, across all our supply chain facilities, including proper hygiene, social distancing, mask use, and temperature screenings. These measures may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among our employees. Illness, travel restrictions, absenteeism, or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, or other business processes. We may face additional production disruptions in the future, which may place constraints on our ability to produce products in a timely manner or may increase our costs. We experienced increased demand for our products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and were, and continue to be, unable to fill all customer orders. Short term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our retail customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain. Our failure to meet the demand for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Concerns with the safety and quality of our products could cause consumers to avoid certain products or ingredients. We could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain of our products or ingredients. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. If our products become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled, we might need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers or their pets are injured. We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. A significant product recall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands. 10 We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends, which may result in decreased demand for our products. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes, eating habits, and purchasing behaviors of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences in channels where they shop. Consumer preferences and category-level consumption may change from time to time and can be affected by a number of different trends and other factors. If we fail to anticipate, identify or react to these changes and trends, such as adapting to emerging e-commerce channels, or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, we may experience reduced demand for our products, which would in turn cause our revenues and profitability to suffer. Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium, trans fats, genetically modified organisms, sugar, processed wheat, grain-free or legume-rich pet food, or other product ingredients or attributes. We may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categories. The food industry’s growth potential is constrained by population growth. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve. One way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories. Our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories. If we do not succeed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected. Economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products.  The willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions. In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may purchase more generic, private label, and other economy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether. In those circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings. In addition, as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions, we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins. Consumers may also reduce the amount of food that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Deteriorating economic and political conditions in our major markets affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased unemployment, decreases in disposable income, declines in consumer confidence, or economic slowdowns or recessions, could cause a decrease in demand for our products. Our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands.  Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of our many iconic brands is critical to the success of our business. The value of our brands is based in large part on the degree to which consumers react and respond positively to these brands. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, concerns about food safety, or our products becoming unavailable to consumers. Consumer demand for our products may also be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support. The use of social and digital media by consumers, us, and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our business results could be negatively impacted. Our international operations are subject to political and economic risks.  In fiscal 2020, 24 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the United States. We are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include: political and economic instability; exchange controls and currency exchange rates; tariffs on products and ingredients that we import and export; nationalization or government control of operations;compliance with anti-corruption regulations;uncertainty relating to the impact of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union;foreign tax treaties and policies; and restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences. 11 Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. These fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations. Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, and Swiss franc. From time to time, we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure. A strengthening in the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in the countries in which we operate, such as has generally occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic to-date, would negatively affect our reported results of operations and financial results due to currency translation losses and currency transaction losses. New regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business.  Our facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the production, packaging, labelling, storage, distribution, quality, and safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees. Our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products. We advertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. We may also be subject to new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise our products, including restrictions on the audience to whom products are marketed. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected. Significant COVID-19 related changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products (including quarantines, import/export restrictions, price controls, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions or otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers, or customers from sufficiently staffing operations, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, sale, and support of our products) could adversely impact our operations and results. We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies. We are currently party to a variety of environmental remediation obligations. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation, and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours, the potential exists for remediation, liability, indemnification, and compliance costs to differ from our estimates. We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters, or compliance with environmental laws in general, will not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends. As of May 31, 2020, we had total debt, redeemable interests, and noncontrolling interests of $14.4 billion. The agreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness may limit our: ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; andflexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions. There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and noncontrolling interests. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness, and other unrelated indebtedness, could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, and other factors beyond our control. 12 Global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing, and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers. We depend on stable, liquid, and well-functioning capital and credit markets to fund our operations. Although we believe that our operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital and credit markets, and revolving credit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. We also utilize interest rate derivatives to reduce the volatility of our financing costs. If we are not effective in hedging this volatility, we may experience an increase in our costs of borrowing. Our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets. We may not have access to preferred sources of liquidity when needed or on terms we find acceptable, and our borrowing costs could increase. An economic or credit crisis could occur and impair credit availability and our ability to raise capital when needed. A disruption in the financial markets may have a negative effect on our derivative counterparties and could impair our banking or other business partners, on whom we rely for access to capital and as counterparties to our derivative contracts. From time to time, we issue variable rate securities based on interbank offered rates (IBORs) and enter into interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on an IBOR. There is currently uncertainty whether certain IBORs will continue to be available after 2021. If certain IBORs cease to be available, we may need to amend affected agreements, and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our counterparties and security holders. As a result, our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension, other postretirement benefit, and postemployment benefit costs. We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada, and various foreign locations, including defined benefit pension, retiree health and welfare, severance, and other postemployment plans. Our major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations. Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached. Information technology serves an important role in the efficient and effective operation of our business. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic information to manage a variety of business processes and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. Our information technology systems and infrastructure are critical to effectively manage our key business processes including digital marketing, order entry and fulfillment, supply chain management, finance, administration, and other business processes. These technologies enable internal and external communication among our locations, employees, suppliers, customers, and others and include the receipt and storage of personal information about our employees, consumers, and proprietary business information. Our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to damage, interruption, or shutdown due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events, natural disasters, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, security breaches, computer viruses, hackers, employee error or malfeasance, and other causes. Increased cyber-security threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on those systems. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, data loss, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory penalties, and the loss of sales and customers. Any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational, reputational, legal, and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business. 13 A change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth. As of May 31, 2020, we had $20.5 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We compare the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. If current expectations for growth rates for sales and profits are not met, or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions that could be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise were to change, then our reporting units could become significantly impaired. Our Europe & Australia reporting unit had experienced declining business performance, and we continue to monitor this business. While we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired, different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses. We evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets, primarily intangible assets associated with the Blue Buffalo, Pillsbury, Totino’s, Progresso, Yoplait, Old El Paso, Yoki, Häagen-Dazs, and Annie’s brands, to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.  Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Our estimate of the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including projected revenues from our long-range plan, assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands, and a discount rate. If current expectations for growth rates for sales and margins are not met, or other market factors and macroeconomic conditions that could be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise were to change, then our indefinite-lived intangible assets could become significantly impaired. Our Pillsbury and Progresso brands had experienced declining business performance, and we continue to monitor these businesses. For further information on goodwill and intangible assets, please refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adversely affect our financial results. From time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further our strategic objectives. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate acquired and existing operations. If we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions, our financial results could suffer. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage, the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities, the inherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience, failure to achieve anticipated synergies, and the impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets.  "

Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks described below couldmaterially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.The food categories in which we participate are very competitive, and if we are not able to competeeffectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected.The food categories in which we participate are very competitive. Our principal competitors inthese categories all have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In most productcategories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also withgeneric and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition in ourproduct categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition andloyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfyconsumer preferences. If our large competitors were to seek an advantage through pricing orpromotional changes, we could choose to do the same, which could adversely affect our margins andprofitability. If we did not do the same, our revenues and market share could be adverselyaffected. Our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are notsuccessful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by newproduct introductions of our competitors. If we are unable to build and sustain brand equity byoffering recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing overgeneric and private label products.We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment.The five largest customers in our U.S. Retail segment accounted for 53 percent of its net sales forfiscal 2011, the five largest customers in our International segment accounted for 24 percent ofits net sales for fiscal 2011, and the five largest customers in our Bakeries and Foodservicesegment accounted for 45 percent of its net sales for fiscal 2011. The loss of any large customerfor an extended length of time could adversely affect our sales and profits. In addition, largeretail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improvedefficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasison generic and other economy brands, and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to useour scale, marketing expertise, product innovation, knowledge of consumers needs, and categoryleadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability or volume growth could benegatively impacted.Price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials, packaging, and energy mayadversely affect our profitability.The principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused byexternal conditions such as weather, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity marketfluctuations, currency fluctuations, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policiesand regulations.

These gains and lossesare reported in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocatedcorporate items in our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in ourmanufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operatingprofit. We also record our grain inventories at fair value. We may experience volatile earnings asa result of these accounting treatments.If we are not efficient in our production, our profitability could suffer as a result of the highlycompetitive environment in which we operate.Our future success and earnings growth depends in part on our ability to be efficient in theproduction and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets.

Our failure to anticipate, identify orreact to these changes and trends, or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis,could result in reduced demand for our products, which would in turn cause our revenues andprofitability to suffer. Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concernsregarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium, trans fats, sugar, processed wheat, orother product ingredients or attributes.We may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and moreprofitable categories.The food industrys growth potential is constrained by population growth. Our success depends inpart on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that weserve. One way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new productsin faster growing and more profitable categories. Our future results will also depend on ourability to increase market share in our existing product categories. If we do not succeed indeveloping innovative products for new and existing categories, our growth may slow, which couldadversely affect our profitability.9 Customer demand for our products may be limited in future periods as a result of increasedpurchases in response to promotional activity.Our unit volume in the last week of each quarter can be higher than the average for the precedingweeks of the quarter in certain circumstances. In comparison to the average daily shipments in thefirst 12 weeks of a quarter, the final week of each quarter may have as much as four days worth ofincremental shipments (based on a five-day week), reflecting increased promotional activity at theend of the quarter. This increased activity includes promotions to assure that our customers havesufficient inventory on hand to support major marketing events or increased seasonal demand earlyin the next quarter, as well as promotions intended to help achieve interim unit volume targets.If, due to quarter-end promotions or other reasons, our customers purchase more product in anyreporting period than end-consumer demand will require in future periods, our sales level in futurereporting periods could be adversely affected.Economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products.The willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions.In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may purchase more generic, private label, and othereconomy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether. In those circumstances, we couldexperience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lowermargin offerings. In addition, as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions, we may beunable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins. Consumers may also reduce the amount offood that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our Bakeries andFoodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Our international operations are subject to political and economic risks.In fiscal 2011, 19 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the UnitedStates. We are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally,any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include:  political and economic instability;  exchange controls and currency exchange rates;  nationalization of operations;  foreign tax treaties and policies; and  restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentiallynegative tax consequences.Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currencyexchange rates. These fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations.Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar,Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, and Mexican peso. From time to time, we enter into agreementsthat are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but theseagreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure.New regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business.Food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal, state, local andforeign agencies. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements onus, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, could increase our cost of doing business orrestrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected. In addition, weadvertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptiveadvertising under federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. We may also be subject to newlaws or regulations restricting our right to advertise products, including the Interagency WorkingGroup on Food Marketed to Children Preliminary Proposed Nutrition Principles to Guide IndustrySelf-Regulatory Efforts and other proposals to limit advertising to children.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and other options and insome cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends.As of May 29, 2011, we had total debt and noncontrolling interests of $7.1 billion. The agreementsunder which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecuredindebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness may limit our:10  ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or generalcorporate purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by ratingorganizations were revised downward; and flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us morevulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions.There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments andnoncontrolling interests. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the relatedindebtedness (and other unrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its statedmaturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adverselyaffected.Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations willdepend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economicconditions and to financial, business, and other factors beyond our control.Global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costsof borrowing, and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers.The global capital and credit markets, including commercial paper markets, have experiencedincreased volatility and disruption, making it more difficult for companies to access thosemarkets. We depend on stable, liquid, and well-functioning capital and credit markets to fund ouroperations. Although we believe that our operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capitaland credit markets, and revolving-credit agreements will permit us to meet our financing needs forthe foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility anddisruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs ofborrowing. Our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experiencedisruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy.Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors or changes in our employeebase could substantially increase our defined benefit pension, other postretirement, andpostemployment benefit costs.We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada, andvarious foreign locations, including defined benefit pension, retiree health and welfare,severance, directors life, and other postemployment plans. Our major defined benefit pension plansare funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and otherinvestments. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates,investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our definedbenefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirementsof the plans. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have anegative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations.Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to performadequately.The efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely onour information technology systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supplychain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of our informationtechnology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result intransaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing ourbusiness and results of operations to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems maybe vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire,natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches, and viruses. Any such damage orinterruption could have a material adverse effect on our business.If other potentially responsible parties (PRPs) are unable to contribute to remediation costs atcertain contaminated sites, our costs for remediation could be material.We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and health and safetylaws and regulations. Under certain of these laws, namely the Comprehensive Environmental Response,Compensation, and Liability Act and its state counterparts, liability for investigation andremediation of hazardous substance contamination at currently or formerly owned or operatedfacilities or at third-party waste disposal sites is joint and several. We currently are involvedin active remediation efforts at certain sites where we have been named a PRP. If other PRPs atthese sites are unable to contribute to remediation costs, we could be held responsible for theirportion of the remediation costs, and those costs could be material. We cannot assure that ourcosts in relation to these environmental matters or compliance with environmental laws in generalwill not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business andresults of operations.11 A change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a differentweighted-average cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinite-livedintangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.Goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events orchanges in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We compare the carrying valueof the net assets of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. If thefair value of the net assets of the reporting unit is less than the net assets including goodwill,impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flowmodel. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual long-rangeplanning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, marketcomparables, and other factors. While we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired,different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result insignificant impairment losses.We evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets, primarily intangible assets associated withthe Pillsbury, Totinos, Progresso, Green Giant, Old El Paso and Häagen-Dazs brands, to determineif they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requiressignificant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand,competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technologicaladvances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, andexpected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and theexpected lives of other related groups of assets.Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever eventsor changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Our estimateof the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including:projected revenues from our annual long-range plan; assumed royalty rates which could be payable ifwe did not own the brands; and a discount rate.As of May 29, 2011, we had $10.5 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Whilewe currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and thatthose intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, differentassumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost ofcapital could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense.Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing operations could adverselyaffect our financial results.From time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that would further ourstrategic objectives. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate acquired andexisting operations. If we are unable to successfully integrate acquisitions, including recentlyacquired Yoplait interests, our financial results could suffer. Additional potential risksassociated with acquisitions include additional debt leverage, the loss of key employees andcustomers of the acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities, the inherent riskassociated with entering a line of business in which we have no or limited prior experience,failure to achieve anticipated synergies, and the impairment of goodwill or otheracquisition-related intangible assets"

Our business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks described below couldmaterially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.The food categories in which we participate are very competitive, and if we are not able to competeeffectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected.The food categories in which we participate are very competitive. Our principal competitors inthese categories all have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In most productcategories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also withgeneric and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition in ourproduct categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition andloyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfyconsumer preferences. If our large competitors were to decrease their pricing or were to increasetheir promotional spending, we could choose to do the same, which could adversely affect ourmargins and profitability. If we did not do the same, our revenues and market share could beadversely affected. Our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we arenot successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or bynew product introductions of our competitors. If we are unable to build and sustain brand equity byoffering recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing overgeneric and private label products.We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retail environment.The five largest customers in our U.S. Retail segment accounted for 54 percent of its net sales forfiscal 2010, the five largest customers in our International segment accounted for 23 percent ofits net sales for fiscal 2010, and the five largest customers in our Bakeries and Foodservicesegment accounted for 45 percent of its net sales for fiscal 2010. The loss of any large customerfor an extended length of time could adversely affect our sales and profits. In addition, largeretail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improvedefficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasison generic and other economy brands, and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to useour scale, marketing expertise, product innovation, knowledge of consumers needs, and categoryleadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability or volume growth could benegatively impacted.9Table of ContentsPrice changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials, packaging, and energy mayadversely affect our profitability.The principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused byexternal conditions such as weather and product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commoditymarket fluctuations, currency fluctuations, and changes in governmental agricultural and energyprograms. Commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging,and energy costs. If we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs orincrease our prices, we may experience reduced margins and profitability. We do not fully hedgeagainst changes in commodity prices, and the risk management procedures that we do use may notalways work as we intend.Volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations incommodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings.We utilize derivatives to manage price risk for some of our principal ingredient and energy costs,including grains (oats, wheat, and corn), oils (principally soybean), non-fat dry milk, naturalgas, and diesel fuel. Changes in the values of these derivatives are recorded in earningscurrently, resulting in volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and lossesare reported in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and in unallocatedcorporate items in our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in ourmanufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are reclassified to segment operatingprofit. We also record our grain inventories at fair value. We may experience volatile earnings asa result of these accounting treatments.If we are not efficient in our production, our profitability could suffer as a result of the highlycompetitive environment in which we operate.Our future success and earnings growth depends in part on our ability to be efficient in theproduction and manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets. Gaining additionalefficiencies may become more difficult over time. Our failure to reduce costs through productivitygains or by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect ourprofitability and weaken our competitive position. Many productivity initiatives involve complexreorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines. Such manufacturing realignment mayresult in the interruption of production, which may negatively impact product volume and margins.Disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business.Our ability to make, move, and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption toraw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, includingany potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, pandemic, strikes,import restrictions, or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products.Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or toeffectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a singlesupplier or location, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well asrequire additional resources to restore our supply chain.Concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoid certain foodproducts or ingredients.We could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safetyand quality of certain food products or ingredients. Adverse publicity about these types ofconcerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products or causeproduction and delivery disruptions.If our food products become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled, we might need to recall thoseitems and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured.We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated, misbranded, or mislabeled. Awidespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, thedestruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a periodof time. We could also suffer losses from a significant10Table of Contentsproduct liability judgment against us. A significant product recall or product liability case couldalso result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence inour food products, which could have an adverse effect on our business results and the value of ourbrands.We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends, which may result indecreased demand for our products.Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes and eating habits of consumersand to offer products that appeal to their preferences. Consumer preferences change from time totime and can be affected by a number of different trends. Our failure to anticipate, identify orreact to these changes and trends, or to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis,could result in reduced demand for our products, which would in turn cause our revenues andprofitability to suffer. Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concernsregarding the health effects of ingredients such as sodium, trans fats, sugar, processed wheat, orother product ingredients or attributes.We may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growing and moreprofitable categories.The food industrys growth potential is constrained by population growth. Our success depends inpart on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that weserve. One way to achieve that growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new productsin faster growing and more profitable categories. Our future results will also depend on ourability to increase market share in our existing product categories. If we do not succeed indeveloping innovative products for new and existing categories, our growth may slow, which couldadversely affect our profitability.Customer demand for our products may be limited in future periods as a result of increasedpurchases in response to promotional activity.Our unit volume in the last week of each quarter can be higher than the average for the precedingweeks of the quarter in certain circumstances. In comparison to the average daily shipments in thefirst 12 weeks of a quarter, the final week of each quarter may have as much as four days worth ofincremental shipments (based on a five-day week), reflecting increased promotional activity at theend of the quarter. This increased activity includes promotions to assure that our customers havesufficient inventory on hand to support major marketing events or increased seasonal demand earlyin the next quarter, as well as promotions intended to help achieve interim unit volume targets.If, due to quarter-end promotions or other reasons, our customers purchase more product in anyreporting period than end-consumer demand will require in future periods, our sales level in futurereporting periods could be adversely affected.Economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products.The willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions.In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may purchase more generic, private label, and othereconomy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether. In those circumstances, we couldexperience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lowermargin offerings. In addition, as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions, we may beunable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins. Consumers may also reduce the amount offood that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our Bakeries andFoodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Our international operations are subject to political and economic risks.In fiscal 2010, 18 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the UnitedStates. We are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally,any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include: political and economic instability;11Table of Contents exchange controls and currency exchange rates;  foreign tax treaties and policies; and  restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentiallynegative tax consequences.Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currencyexchange rates. These fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations.Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar,Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, and Mexican peso. From time to time, we enter into agreementsthat are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but theseagreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure.New regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business.Food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal, state, local, andforeign agencies. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements onus, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, could increase our cost of doing business orrestrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected. In addition, weadvertise our products and could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptiveadvertising under federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations and of new laws or regulationsrestricting our right to advertise products, including advertising to children.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and other options and insome cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends.As of May 30, 2010, we had total debt and noncontrolling interests of $6.7 billion. The agreementsunder which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecuredindebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness may limit our: ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or generalcorporate purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by ratingorganizations were revised downward; and flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us morevulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions.There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments andnoncontrolling interests. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the relatedindebtedness (and other unrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its statedmaturity and our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adverselyaffected.Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations willdepend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economicconditions and to financial, business, and other factors beyond our control.Global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costsof borrowing, and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers.The global capital and credit markets, including commercial paper markets, have experiencedincreased volatility and disruption, making it more difficult for companies to access thosemarkets.

Increases instatutory income tax rates and other adverse changes in applicable law in any of the jurisdictionsin which we operate could reduce our after-tax income and have an adverse effect on our results ofoperations.Our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available tous in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Management judgment is involved in determiningour effective tax rate and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of any uncertain tax positions. Weare periodically engaged in tax controversies (e.g., examinations, administrative appeals, andlitigation) with revenue and tax authorities. We establish liabilities in a variety of taxingjurisdictions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believethat certain positions may be challenged and may need to be revised. We adjust these liabilities inlight of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, and changes inthese liabilities affect our effective income tax rate. We also record interest on theseliabilities at the appropriate statutory interest rate. These interest charges are also included inour effective tax rate, but are not included in our liabilities for uncertain tax positionsdisclosed elsewhere in this report. Adjustments to these liabilities for individual issues havegenerally not exceeded 1 percent of earnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from jointventures annually.The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has concluded its field examinations of our fiscal 2002 to 2006returns. With limited exceptions, all matters raised in the field examinations have been resolved.The IRS has challenged the amount of capital loss and depreciation and amortization we reported asa result of our sale of noncontrolling interests in our General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC)subsidiary. The IRS has proposed adjustments that effectively eliminate most of the tax benefitsassociated with this transaction. We believe our positions are supported by substantial technicalauthority and are vigorously defending our positions. We are currently in negotiations with the IRSAppeals Division for fiscal 2002 to 2006. Our potential liability for this matter is significant.We have determined that a portion of this matter should be included as a component of our totalliabilities for uncertain tax positions as disclosed in Note 14 to our Consolidated FinancialStatements included in Item 8 of this report"

This increased activity includes promotions to assure that our customers havesufficient inventory on hand to support major marketing events or increased seasonal demand earlyin the next quarter, as well as promotions intended to help achieve interim unit volume targets.If, due to quarter-end promotions or other reasons, our customers purchase more product in anyreporting period than end-consumer demand will require in future periods, our sales level in futurereporting periods could be adversely affected.Economic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products.The willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on local economic conditions.In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may purchase more generic, private label, and othereconomy brands and may forego certain purchases altogether. In those circumstances, we couldexperience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lowermargin offerings. In addition, as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions, we may beunable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect margins. Consumers may also reduce the amount offood that they consume away from home at customers that purchase products from our Bakeries andFoodservice segment. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Our international operations are subject to political and economic risks.In fiscal 2009, 18 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the UnitedStates. We are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally,any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include: political and economic instability; exchange controls and currency exchange rates; foreign tax treaties and policies; and restriction on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentiallynegative tax consequences.Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currencyexchange rates. These fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations.Our principal exposures are to the Australian dollar, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar,Chinese renminbi, euro, Japanese yen, and Mexican peso. From time to time, we enter into agreementsthat are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but theseagreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure.9Table of ContentsNew regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business.Food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal, state, local, andforeign agencies. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements onus could increase our cost of doing business or restrict our actions, causing our results ofoperations to be adversely affected. In addition, we advertise our products and could be the targetof claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign lawsand regulations and of new laws or regulations restricting our right to advertise products.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and other options and insome cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends.As of May 31, 2009, we had total debt and minority interests of $7.3 billion. The agreements underwhich we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecuredindebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness may limit our: ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or generalcorporate purposes, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by ratingorganizations were revised downward; and flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerableto a downturn in general economic conditions.There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and minorityinterests. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness (and otherunrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity and our abilityto obtain additional or alternative financing may also be adversely affected.Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and other obligations willdepend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economicconditions and to financial, business, and other factors beyond our control.Global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costsof borrowing, and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers.The global capital and credit markets, including commercial paper markets, have recentlyexperienced increased volatility and disruption, making it more difficult for companies to accessthose markets. We depend on stable, liquid, and well-functioning capital and credit markets to fundour operations. Although we believe that our operating cash flows, financial assets, access tocapital and credit markets, and revolving-credit agreements will permit us to meet our financingneeds for the foreseeable future, there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatilityand disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase ourcosts of borrowing. Our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customersexperience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in thegeneral economy.Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors or changes in our employeebase could substantially increase our defined benefit pension, other postretirement, andpostemployment benefit costs.We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada, andvarious foreign locations, including defined benefit pension, retiree health and welfare,severance, directors life, and other postemployment plans. Our major defined benefit pension plansare funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and otherinvestments. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates,investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our definedbenefit plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirementsof the plans. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have anegative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations.10Table of ContentsOur business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to performadequately.The efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely onour information technology systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supplychain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of our informationtechnology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result intransaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing ourbusiness and results of operations to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems maybe vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire,natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches, and viruses. Any such damage orinterruption could have a material adverse effect on our business.If other potentially responsible parties (PRPs) are unable to contribute to remediation costs atcertain contaminated sites, our costs for remediation could be material.We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and health and safetylaws and regulations. Under certain of these laws, namely the Comprehensive Environmental Response,Compensation, and Liability Act and its state counterparts, liability for investigation andremediation of hazardous substance contamination at currently or formerly owned or operatedfacilities or at third-party waste disposal sites is joint and several. We currently are involvedin active remediation efforts at certain sites where we have been named a PRP. If other PRPs atthese sites are unable to contribute to remediation costs, we could be held responsible for theirportion of the remediation costs, and those costs could be material. We cannot assure that ourcosts in relation to these environmental matters or compliance with environmental laws in generalwill not exceed our established liabilities or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business andresults of operations.A change in the assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or a differentweighted-average cost of capital used to value our reporting units or our indefinite-livedintangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.Goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and whenever events orchanges in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. We compare the carrying valueof the net assets of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. If thefair value of the net assets of the reporting unit is less than the net assets including goodwill,impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flowmodel. Growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual long-rangeplanning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growth assumptions, marketcomparables, and other factors. While we currently believe that our goodwill is not impaired,different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result insignificant impairment losses.We evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets, primarily intangible assets associated withthe Pillsbury, Totinos, Progresso, Green Giant, Old El Paso, and Häagen-Dazs brands, to determineif they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requiressignificant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand,competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, known technologicaladvances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, andexpected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and theexpected lives of other related groups of assets.Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually and whenever eventsor changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Our estimateof the fair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including:projected revenues from our annual long-range plan; assumed royalty rates which could be payable ifwe did not own the brands; and a discount rate.As of May 31, 2009, we had $10.4 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Whilewe currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and thatthose intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materiallydifferent assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a differentweighted-average cost of capital could result in significant impairment losses and amortizationexpense.11Table of ContentsResolution of uncertain income tax matters and changes in tax laws could adversely affect ourresults of operations or cash flows from operations.We are subject to income tax in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases instatutory income tax rates in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce ourafter-tax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available tous in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Management judgment is involved in determiningour effective tax rate and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of any uncertain tax positions. Weare periodically under examination or engaged in a tax controversy. We establish liabilities in avariety of taxing jurisdictions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions aresupportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged and may need to be revised. Weadjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of atax audit, and changes in these liabilities affect our effective income tax rate. We also recordinterest on these liabilities at the appropriate statutory interest rate. These interest chargesare also included in our effective tax rate, but are not included in our liabilities for uncertaintax positions disclosed elsewhere in this report. Adjustments to these liabilities for individualissues have generally not exceeded 1 percent of earnings before income taxes and after-tax earningsfrom joint ventures annually.The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has concluded its field examinations of our 2002-2006 federaltax years. With limited exceptions, all matters raised in the field examinations have beenresolved. The IRS has challenged the amount of capital loss and depreciation and amortization wereported as a result of our sale of minority interests in our General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC)subsidiary. The IRS has proposed adjustments that effectively eliminate most of the tax benefitsassociated with this transaction. We believe we have meritorious defenses and are vigorouslydefending our positions. We have appealed the results of the IRS field examination to the IRSAppeals Division. Our potential liability for this matter is significant. We have determined that aportion of this matter should be included as a component of our total liabilities for uncertain taxpositions as disclosed in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 ofthis report"

Various risks and uncertainties could affect our business. Any of the risks described below or elsewherein this report or our other filings with the SEC could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and resultsof operations. It is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. 5Table of ContentsAdditional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to beimmaterial also may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations in the future. Therefore, thefollowing is not intended to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.The food categories in which we participate are very competitive, and if we are notable to compete effectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected.The food categories in which we participate are very competitive. Our principal competitors in thesecategories all have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In most product categories, we compete not only withother widely advertised branded products, but also with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lowerprices. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition andloyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. If ourlarge competitors were to decrease their pricing or were to increase their promotional spending, we could choose to do the same,which could adversely affect our margins and profitability. If we did not do the same, our revenues and market share could beadversely affected. Our market share and revenue growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducinginnovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors. If we are unableto build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricingover generic and private label products.We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidating retailenvironment.The 5 largest customers in our U.S. Retail segment accounted for 54 percent of its fiscal 2007 netsales, the 5 largest customers in our International segment accounted for 41 percent of its net sales for fiscal 2007, and the 5largest customers in our Bakeries and Foodservice segment accounted for 40 percent of its net sales for fiscal 2007. The loss ofany large customer for an extended length of time could adversely affect our sales and profits. There has been significantworldwide consolidation in the grocery industry in recent years and we believe that this trend is likely to continue. As theretail grocery trade continues to consolidate and mass market retailers become larger, our large retail customers may seek to usetheir position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, and increased promotional programs. Ifwe are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation, and category leadership positions to respond to thesedemands, our profitability or volume growth could be negatively impacted.Price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materials, packaging, and energymay adversely affect our profitability.The principal raw materials that we use are grains (wheat, oats, and corn), sugar, dairy products,vegetables, fruits, meats, vegetable oils, and other agricultural products. We also use substantial quantities of carton board,corrugated and plastic packaging materials, operating supplies, and energy. These items are largely commodities that experienceprice volatility caused by external conditions such as weather and product scarcity, commodity market fluctuations, currencyfluctuations, and changes in governmental agricultural programs. Commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in rawmaterial, packaging, and energy costs. If we are unable to increase productivity to offset these increased costs or increase ourprices as a result of consumer sensitivity to pricing or otherwise, we may experience reduced margins and profitability. We do notfully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and the hedging procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend.If we are not efficient in our production, our profitability could suffer as a resultof the highly competitive environment in which we operate.Our future success and earnings growth depends in part on our ability to be efficient in the productionand manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets. Our ability to gain additional efficiencies may become moredifficult over time as we take advantage of existing opportunities. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or byeliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitiveposition. Further, many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of manufacturing facilities and production lines.Such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production which may negatively impact product volume andmargins.Disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business.Our ability to make, move, and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to rawmaterial supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, pandemic,strikes, or other reasons could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigatethe likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a 6Table of Contentsproduct is sourced from a single location, could adversely affect our business and results ofoperations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and trends, which mayresult in decreased demand for our products.Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes and eating habits of consumers andto offer products that appeal to their preferences. Consumer preferences change from time to time and can be affected by a numberof different trends. Our failure to anticipate, identify or react to these changes and trends, or to introduce new and improvedproducts on a timely basis, could result in reduced demand for our products, which would in turn cause our revenues andprofitability to suffer. Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects ofingredients such as trans fats, sugar, processed wheat, or other product ingredients or attributes.We may be unable to grow our market share or add products that are in faster growingand more profitable categories.The food industrys growth potential is constrained by population growth. Our success depends inpart on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve. One way to achieve thatgrowth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories. Our futureresults will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories. If we do not succeed indeveloping innovative products for new and existing categories, our growth may slow, which could adversely affect ourprofitability.Customer demand for our products may be limited in future periods as a result ofincreased purchases in response to promotional activity.Our unit volume in the last week of each quarter can be higher than the average for the preceding weeksof the quarter in certain circumstances. In comparison to the average daily shipments in the first 12 weeks of a quarter, thefinal week of each quarter may have as much as two to four days worth of incremental shipments (based on a five-day week),reflecting increased promotional activity at the end of the quarter. This increased activity includes promotions to assure thatour customers have sufficient inventory on hand to support major marketing events or increased seasonal demand early in the nextquarter, as well as promotions intended to help achieve interim unit volume targets. If, due to quarter-end promotions or otherreasons, our customers purchase more product in any reporting period than end-consumer demand will require in future periods, oursales level in future reporting periods could be adversely affected.Economic downturns could cause consumers to shift their food purchases from our higherpriced premium products to lower priced items, which could adversely affect our results of operations.The willingness of consumers to purchase premium branded food products depends in part on local economicconditions. In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers tend to purchase more generic, private label, and other economy brands.In those circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lowermargin offerings. In addition, as a result of economic conditions or otherwise, we may be unable to raise our prices due toincreased consumer sensitivity to pricing. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Volatility in the market value of derivatives we use to hedge exposures to fluctuationsin commodity prices will cause volatility in our gross margins and net earnings.We utilize derivatives to hedge price risk for various raw materials and energy input costs, includinggrains (wheat, oats, and corn), oils (principally soybean), non-fat dry milk, natural gas, and diesel fuel. Application of hedgeaccounting under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments andHedging Activities, as amended, (SFAS 133) requires significant resources, record keeping, and analytical systems. As aresult of the rising compliance costs and the complexity associated with the application of hedge accounting, effective as of thebeginning of fiscal 2008 we will no longer be documenting our commodity derivatives as hedges of our commodity price risk.Accordingly, the changes in the values of these derivatives will be recorded in earnings currently, resulting in volatility inboth gross margin and net earnings. These gains and losses will be reported in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements ofEarnings and in unallocated corporate expenses in our segment operating results. This volatility could cause results reported inany period to differ from our expectations. Our net earnings over the life of the derivative contracts remain unchanged.Our international operations are subject to political and economic risks.In fiscal 2007, 17 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the United States. Weare accordingly 7Table of Contentssubject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally, any of which couldsignificantly harm our business. These risks include:political and economic instability;exchange controls and currency exchange rates;foreign tax treaties and policies; andrestrictions on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries.    Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject tofluctuations in currency exchange rates. These fluctuations could cause material variations in our results of operations. Ourprincipal exposures are to the Australian dollar, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Euro, and Mexican peso. From time totime, we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but theseagreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure.Concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumers to avoidcertain food products or ingredients.We could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety andquality of certain food products or ingredients. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid, maydiscourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.If our food products become adulterated or misbranded, we might need to recall thoseitems and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured.We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded. We may also beliable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses dueto the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a periodof time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. A significant product recall orproduct liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in ourfood products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands.New regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business.Food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal, state, local, and foreignagencies. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doingbusiness or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected. In addition, we advertise ourproducts and could be the target of claims relating to false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign laws andregulations.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financing and otheroptions and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends.As of May 27, 2007, we had total debt and minority interests of $7.3 billion. The agreements underwhich we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in the future. Our level ofindebtedness may limit our:ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes,particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; andflexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in generaleconomic conditions.    There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debtinstruments and minority interests. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness (and otherunrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity, and our ability to obtain additional oralternative financing may also be adversely affected.    If our subsidiary General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) fails to make requireddistributions to the holders of its Series B-1 preferred membership interests, we will be restricted from paying any dividends(other than dividends in the form of shares of common stock) or other distributions on shares of our common stock and may notrepurchase shares of our common stock until such distributions are paid.    Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and otherobligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions andto financial, business, and other factors beyond our control.Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates, and other factors or changes inour employee base could substantially increase our defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefitcosts.We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada, and variousforeign locations, including defined benefit pension, retiree health and welfare,8Table of Contentsseverance, and other postemployment benefit plans. Our major defined benefit pension plans are fundedwith trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in interest rates,mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect thefunded status of our defined benefit pension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plans and cause volatility in thenet periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. Although the aggregate fair value of our defined benefitpension, other postretirement, and postemployment benefit plan assets exceeded the aggregate defined benefit pension, otherpostretirement, and postemployment benefit obligations as of May 27, 2007, a significant increase in our obligations or futurefunding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations.Our business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems failto perform adequately.The efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on ourinformation technology systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment,and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt ourbusiness and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing ourbusiness and results of operations to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage orinterruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches, andviruses. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business.If other potentially responsible parties (PRPs) are unable to contribute to remediationcosts at certain contaminated sites, our costs for remediation could be material.We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and health and safety lawsand regulations. Under certain of these laws, namely the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act andits state counterparts, liability for investigation and remediation of hazardous substance contamination at currently or formerlyowned or operated facilities or at third-party waste disposal sites is joint and several. We currently are involved in activeremediation efforts at certain sites where we have been named a PRP. If other PRPs at these sites are unable to contribute toremediation costs, we could be held responsible for all or their portion of the remediation costs, and those costs could bematerial. We cannot assure that our costs in relation to these environmental matters or compliance with environmental laws ingeneral will not exceed our reserves or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively affect ourconsolidated results of operations and net worth.Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fairvalues of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever eventsor changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is performed for each of our reportingunits. We compare the carrying value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to the fair value of the unit. Carrying value isbased on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit, which often requires allocation ofshared or corporate items among reporting units. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we revalue allof the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, excluding goodwill, to determine if the fair value of the net assets isgreater than the net assets including goodwill. If the fair value of the net assets is less than the net assets includinggoodwill, impairment has occurred. Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model. Growth ratesfor sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discountrates, perpetuity growth assumptions, market comparables, and other factors. We periodically engage third-party valuationconsultants to assist in this process. All our reporting units have fair values in excess of their carrying values by at least 20percent.    As of May 27, 2007, we had $6.8 billion of goodwill. While we currently believethat the fair value of goodwill exceeds its carrying value, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of ourbusinesses could result in significant impairment losses.An impairment in the carrying value of, or a change in the useful life of, ourindefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.We evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets, primarily intangible assets associated with thePillsbury, Totinos, Progresso, Green Giant, Old El Paso, and Häagen-Dazsbrands to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgmentsand assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stabilityof the industry, known technological advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing 9Table of Contentsregulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of requiredmaintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.    Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annuallyand whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Our estimate of thefair value of the brands is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs including: projected revenues from our annuallong-range plan; assumed royalty rates which could be payable if we did not own the brands; and a discount rate. We periodicallyengage third-party valuation consultants to assist in this process.    As of May 27, 2007, we had $3.7 billion of indefinite-lived intangibleassets. While we currently believe that the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its carrying value andthat those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, materially different assumptions regardingfuture performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense.Resolution of uncertain income tax matters could adversely affect our results ofoperations or cash flows from operations.Our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to usin the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Management judgment is involved in determining our effective tax rate and inevaluating the ultimate resolution of any uncertain tax positions. We are periodically under examination or engaged in a taxcontroversy. We establish reserves in a variety of taxing jurisdictions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions aresupportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged and may need to be revised. We adjust these reserves in light ofchanging facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. Our effective income tax rate includes the impact ofreserve provisions and changes to those reserves. We also provide interest on these reserves at the appropriate statutory interestrate. These interest charges are also included in our effective tax rate. As of May 27, 2007, our income tax and related interestreserves recorded in other current liabilities were slightly more than $700 million. Reserve adjustments for individual issueshave generally not exceeded 1 percent of earnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from joint ventures annually.Nevertheless, the accumulation of individually insignificant discrete adjustments throughout a particular year has historicallyimpacted our consolidated effective income tax rate by up to 80 basis points.    The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) recently concluded field examinations for our2002 and 2003 federal tax years. These examinations included review of our determinations of cost basis, capital losses, and thedepreciation of tangible assets and amortization of intangible assets arising from our acquisition of Pillsbury and the sale ofminority interests in our GMC subsidiary. The IRS has proposed adjustments related to a majority of the tax benefits associatedwith these items. We believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to vigorously defend our positions. Our potential liabilityfor this matter is significant and, notwithstanding our reserves against this potential liability, an unfavorable resolution couldhave a material adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows from operations"
12,GIS,GENERAL MILLS INC,2006-07-27,"ITEM 1A   RISK FACTORSVarious risks and uncertainties could affect our business. Any of the risks described below or elsewherein this report or our other filings with the SEC could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and resultsof operations. It is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors. Additional risks and uncertainties not presentlyknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely affect our business, financial condition and resultsof operations in the future. Therefore, the following is not intended to be a complete discussion of all potential risks oruncertainties.The food categories in which we participate are very competitive, andif we are not able to compete effectively, our results of operations would be adversely affected.The food categories in which we participate are very competitive. Our principal competitors in thesecategories all have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. We also compete with private label products offeredby supermarkets, mass merchants and other retailers such as club stores. Competition in our product categories is based onproduct innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activityand the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. If our large competitors were to decrease their pricing or wereto increase their promotional spending, we could choose to do the same, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability.If we did not do the same, our revenues and market share could be adversely affected. Our market share and revenue growth couldalso be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demandsor by new product introductions of our competitors. If we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizablysuperior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over private label products.We may be unable to maintain our profit margins in the face of a consolidatingretail environment.Our five largest customers in our U.S. Retail segment together accounted for approximately 47 percentof that segments net sales for fiscal 2006. The loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could adverselyaffect our sales and profits. In addition, as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and mass market retailers becomelarger, our large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency,lower pricing and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovationand category leadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability or volume growth could be negatively impacted.Price changes for the commodities we depend on for raw materialsand packaging may adversely affect our profitability.The raw materials used in our business include cereal grains, sugar, dairy products, vegetables, fruits,meats, vegetable oils, and other agricultural products as well as paper and plastic packaging materials, operating suppliesand energy. These items are largely commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weatherand product scarcity, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations and changes in governmental agricultural programs.Commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging and energy costs. If we are unable toincrease productivity to offset these increased costs or increase our prices as a result of consumer sensitivity to pricingor otherwise, we may experience reduced margins and profitability. We do not fully hedge against changes in commodity pricesand the hedging procedures that we do use may not always work as we intend.If we are not efficient in our production, our profitability couldsuffer as a result of the highly competitive environment in which we operate.Our future success and earnings growth depends in part on our ability to be efficient in the productionand manufacture of our products in highly competitive markets. Our ability to gain additional efficiencies may become moredifficult over time as we take advantage of existing opportunities. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity gainsor by eliminating redundant costs resulting from acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and also weaken ourcompetitive position. Further, many productivity initiatives involve complex reorganization of   7Table of Contentsmanufacturing facilities and production lines. Such manufacturing realignment may result in the interruption of production whichmay negatively impact product volume and margins.Disruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business.Our ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to ourmanufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, pandemic, strikes or other reasonscould impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood orpotential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourcedfrom a single location, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as require additional resourcesto restore our supply chain.We may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences andtrends, which may result in decreased demand for our products.Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes and eating habits of consumersand to offer products that appeal to their preferences. Consumer preferences change from time to time and can be affected bya number of different trends. Our failure to anticipate, identify or react to these changes and trends, and to introduce newand improved products on a timely basis, could result in reduced demand for our products, which would in turn cause our revenuesand profitability to suffer. Similarly, demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the healtheffects of ingredients such as trans fats, sugar, processed wheat or other product ingredients or attributes.We may be unable to grow our market share or add products that arein faster growing and more profitable categories.The food industrys growth potential is constrained by population growth. Our success dependsin part on our ability to grow our business faster than populations are growing in the markets that we serve. One way to achievethat growth is to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories.Our future results will also depend on our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories. If we do notsucceed in developing innovative products for new and existing categories, our growth may slow, which could adversely affectour profitability.Customer demand for our products may be limited in future periods asa result of increased purchases in response to promotional activity.Our unit volume in the last week of each quarter is consistently higher than the average for the precedingweeks of the quarter. In comparison to the average daily shipments in the first 12 weeks of a quarter, the final weekof each quarter has approximately two to four days worth of incremental shipments (based on a five-day week), reflectingincreased promotional activity at the end of the quarter. This increased activity includes promotions to assure that our customershave sufficient inventory on hand to support major marketing events or increased seasonal demand early in the next quarter,as well as promotions intended to help achieve interim unit volume targets. If, due to quarter-end promotions or other reasons,our customers purchase more product in any reporting period than end-consumer demand will require in future periods, our saleslevel in future reporting periods could be adversely affected.Economic downturns could cause consumers to shift their food purchasesfrom our higher priced premium products to lower priced items, which could adversely affect our results of operations.The willingness of consumers to purchase premium branded food products depends in part on local economicconditions. In periods of economic uncertainty, consumers tend to purchase more private label or other economy brands. In thosecircumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales of higher margin products or a shift in our product mix to lower marginofferings. In addition, as a result of economic conditions or otherwise, we may be unable to raise our prices as a result ofincreased consumer sensitivity to pricing. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Our international operations are subject to political and economicrisks.In fiscal 2006, approximately 16 percent of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of theUnited States. We are accordingly subject to a number of risks relating to doing business internationally, any of which couldsignificantly harm our business. These risks include: political and economic instability; exchange controls and currency exchange rates; foreign tax treaties and policies; and restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries.   8Table of Contents    Our financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject tofluctuations in currency exchange rates. These fluctuations could cause our results of operations to vary materially from periodto period. From time to time, we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currencyfluctuations, but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure.Concerns with the safety and quality of food products could cause consumersto avoid our products.We could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safetyand quality of certain food products or ingredients. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether or not valid,may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.If our food products become adulterated or misbranded, we might needto recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured.We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or misbranded. We may also beliable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury. A widespread product recall could result in significant lossesdue to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product fora period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. A significant productrecall or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation and a loss of consumer confidencein our food products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results and the value of our brands.New regulations or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect ourbusiness.Food production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal, state, local and foreignagencies. Changes in laws or regulations that impose additional regulatory requirements on us could increase our cost of doingbusiness or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected. In addition, we advertise ourproducts and could be the target of claims relating to false or deceptive advertising under federal, state and foreign lawsand regulations.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could limit financingand other options and in some cases adversely affect our ability to pay dividends.As of May 28, 2006, we had total debt and minority interests of approximately $7.2 billion. Theagreements under which we have issued indebtedness do not prevent us from incurring additional unsecured indebtedness in thefuture.    Our level of indebtedness may limit our: ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or general corporate purposes,particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward; and flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in generaleconomic conditions.    There are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments and minority interests.If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness and minority interests (and other unrelated indebtedness) couldbecome due and payable prior to its stated maturity. A default under our debt instruments and minority interests may also significantly affect ourability to obtain additional or alternative financing.    If our subsidiary General Mills Cereals, LLC (GMC) fails to make requireddistributions to the holders of the B-1 interests of GMC, we will be restricted from paying any dividends (other than dividendsin the form of shares of common stock) or other distributions on shares of our common stock and may not repurchase or redeemshares of our common stock until such distributions are paid.    Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt and otherobligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditionsand to financial, business and other factors beyond our control.Volatility in the securities markets, interest rates and other factorsor changes in our employee base could substantially increase our pension and postretirement costs.We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for employees in the United States, Canada andvarious foreign locations, including pension, retiree health and welfare, severance and other post-employment plans. Our majorpension plans are funded, with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates,health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded statusof our pension and postretirement plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirementsof the plans. Although the aggregate fair value of our pension and postretirement plan assets exceeded the aggregate pensionand postretirement benefit obligations as of May 28, 2006, a significant increase in future funding requirements couldhave a negative impact on our results of operations or cash flows from operations.   9Table of ContentsIf other potentially responsible parties (PRPs) are unable to contributeto remediation costs at certain contaminated sites, our costs for remediation could be material.We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and health and safety lawsand regulations. Under certain of these laws, namely the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Actand its state counterparts, liability for investigation and remediation of hazardous substance contamination at currently orformerly owned or operated facilities or at third-party waste disposal sites is joint and several. We currently are involvedin active remediation efforts at certain sites where we have been named a PRP. If other PRPs at these sites are unable to contributeto remediation costs, we could be held responsible for all or their portion of the remediation costs, and those costs couldbe material. We cannot assure you that our costs in relation to these environmental matters or compliance with environmentallaws in general will not exceed our reserves or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangiblescould negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase prices of acquired companies and the relatedfair values of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and wheneverevents or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is performed for eachof our reporting units. We compare the carrying amount of goodwill for a reporting unit with its fair value and if the carryingamount of goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment has occurred.    The costs of patents, copyrights and other intangible assets with finite livesare amortized over their estimated useful lives. Intangibles with indefinite lives, principally brands, are carried at cost.Finite and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstancesindicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when fair value is less thanthe carrying amount of the intangible.    Our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flowmodel using inputs from our annual long-range planning process. We also make estimates of discount rates, perpetuity growthassumptions and other factors.    As of May 28, 2006, we had $10.3 billion of goodwill and other intangibleassets. Events and conditions that could result in an impairment include changes in the industries in which we operate, includingcompetition and advances in technology; a significant product liability or intellectual property claim; or other factors leadingto reduction in expected sales or profitability. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, ourconsolidated net earnings and net worth may be materially adversely affected by a non-cash charge.Resolution of uncertain income tax matters could adversely affect ourcash flows from operations.We accrue income tax liabilities for potential assessments related to uncertain tax positions in avariety of taxing jurisdictions. An unfavorable resolution of these matters, including the accounting for losses recorded aspart of the Pillsbury transaction, could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows from operations"
