4,HRB,BLOCK H & R INC,2020-06-17,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business activities expose us to a variety of risks. Identification, monitoring, and management of these risks are essential to the success of our operations and the financial soundness of H&R Block. Senior management and the Board of Directors, acting as a whole and through its committees, take an active role in our risk management process H&R Block, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K7and have delegated certain activities related to the oversight of risk management to the Company's enterprise risk management team and the Enterprise Risk Committee, which is comprised of Vice Presidents of major business and control functions and members of the Enterprise Risk Management team. The Company’s enterprise risk management team, working in coordination with the Enterprise Risk Committee, is responsible for identifying and monitoring risk exposures and related mitigation and leading the continued development of our risk management policies and practices. An investment in our securities involves risk, including the risk that the value of that investment may decline or that returns on that investment may fall below expectations. There are a number of significant factors that could cause actual conditions, events, or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, many of which are beyond management's control or its ability to accurately estimate or predict, or that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and the value of an investment in our securities.RISKS RELATING TO CONTINUING OPERATIONSOur financial condition and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 pandemic, and may be impacted by a resurgence of COVID-19 or a future outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease.During March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a global pandemic. To date, this outbreak, which has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world, including all jurisdictions where the Company operates, and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak, have caused and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas and disruption in the financial markets. Globally, governments have taken a variety of actions to contain the spread of COVID-19, including prohibitions on congregating in groups, business closure orders, shelter-in-place orders, or other similar measures.In the U.S., state, county, and municipal jurisdictions in which we operate issued, and continue to issue, a high volume of emergency orders intended to contain the spread of COVID-19, which imposed various restrictions on our business, including capacity and other operational limitations, social distancing requirements, and in limited instances required us to close certain offices. The requirements of the various emergency orders often differ and, even where similar, may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Our current or future operations, policies, and practices may be determined to be inconsistent with those requirements, interpretations, or applications in certain jurisdictions.We took a variety of actions to address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including implementing our crisis response process, initiating other efforts to facilitate compliance with the various emergency orders (while maintaining continuity of operations as much as practicable), and implementing certain initiatives designed to slow and/or reduce the impact of COVID-19 and to meet the health and safety needs of our clients, associates, and franchisees. Though we were able to continue to provide a reduced number of in-person appointments, in late March 2020 we implemented operational changes across our U.S. assisted locations to increase the number of clients who drop off their documents and approve online. While this allowed clients to obtain professional assisted tax preparation from a tax office with minimal in-person interactions, these changes, along with the extension of the tax season described below, adversely impacted the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2020. Notwithstanding the above-described efforts and our attempts to comply with COVID-19-related requirements, there is no certainty that we will be able to consistently do so or that the measures we have implemented, or implement in the future, will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus. Alleged failures in this regard could result in additional negative impacts, including regulatory investigations, claims, legal actions, harm to our reputation and brands, fines, penalties, and other damages.The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, operations, and financial results going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including COVID-19 orders that continue for indefinite periods, modifications to orders resulting in more stringent requirements, or increased regulations regarding workplace conditions and benefits. Establishing systems and processes, or making changes to our existing policies, to achieve compliance with any of these, or other, complex and evolving requirements may increase our costs or restrict our business operations. In addition, the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic makes it difficult to predict how the demand for our services will be affected. It is unclear how quickly or if clients will 82020 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.return to our offices to file during the remainder of tax season 2020 and in future years, which may be a function of continued concerns over safety or a permanent shift by consumers to DIY or virtual tax preparation methods. We may make changes in our operations to react to, or in anticipation of, such a shift in consumer behaviors, but such changes may not be successful in retaining current clients or attracting new clients to our brand. The further spread of COVID-19 or a new global or national outbreak, the requirements to take action to help limit the spread of illness, and the other risks described above may further impact our ability to carry out our business and may materially adversely impact global economic conditions, our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Our access to liquidity may be negatively impacted by disruptions in credit markets due to COVID-19 or otherwise, by downgraded credit ratings, or by our failure to meet certain covenants. Our funding costs could increase, further impacting earnings.We need liquidity to meet our working capital requirements, to service debt obligations including refinancing of maturing obligations, and for general corporate purposes. Our access to and the cost of liquidity could be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, in the event of credit rating downgrades, or due to our failure to meet financial covenants. On March 26, 2020, we drew down the full $2.0 billion available under our CLOC to increase our cash position and maximize flexibility in light of the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in the amount borrowed under the CLOC led to increased interest expense for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2020, which will remain elevated until such amounts are repaid. In addition, $650 million in principal of our Senior Notes are due in October 2020. Additional events may occur which could increase our need for liquidity above current levels. We may need to obtain additional sources of funding to meet these liquidity needs, which may not be available or may only be available under unfavorable terms. In addition, if rating agencies downgrade our credit rating, the cost of debt under our existing financing arrangements, as well as future financing arrangements, could increase and capital market access could decrease or become unavailable. Our CLOC is subject to various covenants, and, as of April 30, 2020, we were not in compliance with the debt-to-EBITDA ratio covenant due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic described above. Though the lenders under the CLOC waived non-compliance with this covenant as of April 30, 2020, there is no guarantee that they would waive any future covenant violations. If we violate this or other covenants in the CLOC in the future and are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders, our debt under the CLOC would be in default and could be accelerated by our lenders. An acceleration of the indebtedness under the CLOC would cause a cross default under the indenture governing our Senior Notes. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to enable us to repay or refinance our debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets remain unknown. If current sources of liquidity were to become unavailable, we would need to obtain additional sources of funding, which may not be available or may only be available under less favorable terms. This could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Changes in applicable tax laws have had, and may in the future have, a negative impact on the demand for and pricing of our services, adversely affecting our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The U.S. government has in the past made, and may in the future make, changes to the individual income tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, tax regulations, and the rules and procedures for implementing such laws and regulations. In addition, taxing authorities in various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may change the income tax laws in their respective jurisdictions. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 21, 2020, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the IRS announced that the federal tax filing deadline for individual 2019 tax returns was extended from April 15, 2020 to July 15, 2020, and substantially all U.S. states with an April 15 individual state income tax filing requirement extended their respective deadlines. In Canada, the deadline for individuals to file was extended to June 1, 2020. These delays negatively impacted the demand for our services in our fiscal year ended April 30, 2020, resulting in a substantial decrease in the number of tax returns prepared by or through H&R Block, impacting our revenue, cash flows, and earnings for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2020. Treasury, the IRS, and state or foreign officials may determine to further extend tax deadlines or take other actions, which could have H&R Block, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K9an additional material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in future years.It is difficult to predict the manner in which future changes to the Internal Revenue Code, tax regulations, and the rules and procedures for implementing such laws and regulations, and state, local, and foreign tax laws may impact us and the tax return preparation industry. Such future changes could decrease the demand or the amount we charge for our services, and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.There are various other initiatives from time to time seeking to modify the Internal Revenue Code or otherwise simplify tax return preparation. In addition, taxing authorities in various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have also introduced measures seeking to simplify or otherwise modify the preparation and filing of tax returns in their respective jurisdictions. The adoption or expansion of any measures that significantly simplify tax return preparation, or otherwise reduce the need for third-party tax return preparation services could reduce demand for our services and products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Increased competition for tax preparation and small business clients could adversely affect our current market share and profitability. Offers of free services or products could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.We provide assisted, DIY, and virtual tax preparation services and products and face substantial competition throughout our businesses. All categories in the tax return preparation industry are highly competitive and additional competitors have entered, and in the future may enter, the market to provide tax preparation services or products. In the assisted tax services category, there are a substantial number of tax return preparation firms and accounting firms offering tax return preparation services. Commercial tax return preparers are highly competitive with regard to price and service. In the DIY and virtual categories, options include various forms of digital electronic assistance, including online and mobile applications, and desktop software, all of which we offer. Our DIY and virtual services and products compete with a number of online and software companies, primarily on price and functionality. Individual tax filers may elect to change their tax preparation method, choosing from among various assisted, DIY, and virtual offerings, and technology increasingly makes switching among tax preparers and tax preparation methods easier for those consumers. In addition, as discussed above, the COVID-19 pandemic may increase the number of taxpayers switching from assisted tax preparation to DIY or virtual methods.Technology advances quickly and in new and unexpected ways, and it is difficult to predict the manner in which these changes will impact the tax return preparation industry, the problems we may encounter in enhancing our services and products or the time and resources we may need to devote to the creation, support, and maintenance of technological enhancements. If we are slow to enhance our services, products, or technologies, if our competitors are able to achieve results more quickly than us, or if there are new and unexpected entrants into the industry, we may fail to capture, or lose, a significant share of the market. Additionally, we and many other tax return preparation firms compete by offering one or more of RTs, prepaid cards, RAs, other financial services and products, and other tax-related services and products, many of which are subject to regulatory scrutiny, litigation, and other risks. We can make no assurances that we will be able to offer, or continue to offer, all of these services and products and a failure to do so could negatively impact our financial results and ability to compete. Intense competition could result in a reduction of our market share, lower revenues, lower margins, and lower profitability. In addition, Wave faces intense competition with its small business financial solutions. Wave may be unsuccessful in competing with other providers, which may diminish our revenue and profitability, and harm our ability to acquire and retain clients.U.S. federal, state and foreign governmental authorities in certain jurisdictions in which we operate currently offer, or facilitate the offering of, tax return preparation and electronic filing options to taxpayers at no charge, and certain volunteer organizations also prepare tax returns at no charge for low-income taxpayers. In addition, many of our competitors offer certain tax preparation services and products, and other financial services and products, at no charge. In order to compete, we have offered certain, and may in the future offer additional, services and products at no charge. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract clients or effectively ensure the migration of clients from our free offerings to those for which we receive fees, and clients who have formerly paid for our offerings 102020 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.may elect to use free offerings instead. These competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability, or harm our ability to acquire and retain clients.Government tax authorities, volunteer organizations, our competitors, and potential new market entrants may also elect to implement or expand free offerings in the future. Free File, Inc., which operates under an agreement that expires in October 2021, is currently the sole means through which the IRS offers DIY tax software to taxpayers, however the IRS is not prohibited from offering competing services. In addition, from time to time, U.S. federal and state governments have considered various proposals through which the respective governmental taxing authorities would use taxpayer information provided by employers, financial institutions, and other payers to ""pre-populate,"" prepare and calculate tax returns and distribute them to taxpayers. Under this approach, the taxpayer could then review and contest the return or sign and return it, reducing the need for third-party tax return preparation services and the demand for our services and products. There are various initiatives from time to time seeking to expedite refunds, which could reduce the demand for RTs. In addition, the IRS has in the past explored the possibility of allowing taxpayers to allocate a portion of their tax refunds to pay tax preparation fees, but the IRS has not advanced this initiative. We believe that governmental encroachment at both the U.S. federal and state levels, as well as comparable government levels in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, could present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flow.Compliance with the complex and evolving laws, regulations, standards, and contractual requirements regarding privacy and data protection could require changes in our business practices and increase costs of operation; failure to comply could result in significant claims, fines, penalties, and damages.In the course of our business, we collect, use, and retain large amounts of personal information and data from our clients, including tax return information, financial product and service information, and social security numbers. In addition, we collect, use, and retain personal information and data of our employees in the ordinary course of our business.We are subject to laws, rules, and regulations relating to the collection, use, disclosure, and security of such consumer and employee personal information, which have drawn increased attention from U.S. federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate. In the U.S., the IRS generally requires a tax return preparer to obtain the prior written consent of the taxpayer to use or disclose the taxpayer's information for certain purposes other than tax return preparation, which may limit our ability to market revenue-generating products to our clients. In addition, other regulations require financial institutions to adopt and disclose their consumer privacy notice and generally provide consumers with a reasonable opportunity to ""opt-out"" of having nonpublic personal information disclosed to unaffiliated third parties.Numerous jurisdictions have passed, and may in the future pass, new laws related to the use and retention of consumer or employee information and this area continues to be an area of interest for U.S. federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities. For example, the State of California adopted the CCPA, which became effective January 1, 2020. Subject to certain exceptions, the CCPA imposes new requirements on how businesses collect, process, manage, and retain certain personal information of California residents and provides California residents with various rights regarding personal information collected by a business. Several other states have proposed and may adopt their own, different privacy laws. These laws may contain different requirements or may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Our current privacy and data protection policies and practices may not be consistent with all of those requirements, interpretations, or applications. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state regulatory requirements, as well as requirements imposed by governmental authorities in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, could result in more stringent requirements and in a need to change business practices, including the types of information we can use and the manner in which we can use such information. Establishing systems and processes, or making changes to our existing policies, to achieve compliance with these complex and evolving requirements may increase our costs or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will successfully comply in all cases, which could result in regulatory investigations, claims, legal actions, harm to our reputation and brands, fines, penalties, and other damages.H&R Block, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K11We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses to comply with existing privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations.A security breach of our systems, or third-party systems on which we rely, resulting in unauthorized access to personal information of our clients or employees or other sensitive, nonpublic information, may adversely affect the demand for our services and products, our reputation, and financial performance.We offer a range of services and products to our clients, including assisted, DIY, and virtual tax return preparation solutions, financial services and products, and small business financial solutions through our company-owned or franchise offices and online through Wave. Due to the nature of these services and products, we use multiple digital technologies to collect, transmit, and store high volumes of client personal information. We also collect, use, and retain other sensitive, nonpublic information, such as employee social security numbers, healthcare information, and payroll information, as well as confidential, nonpublic business information. Certain third parties and vendors have access to personal information to help deliver client benefits, services and products, or may host certain of our and our clients’ sensitive and personal information and data. Information security risks continue to increase due in part to the increased adoption of and reliance upon digital technologies by companies and consumers. Our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened due to a variety of factors including, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats and related regulation, the increased activity and sophistication of nation states, organized crime, cyber criminals, and hackers, the prominence of our brand, our and our franchisees' extensive office footprint, our plans to continue to implement strategies for our online and mobile applications and our desktop software, our use of third-party vendors, and the increasing usage of remote working arrangements by our associates, franchisees, and third-party vendors, which has significantly expanded due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Cybersecurity risks may result from fraud or malice (a cyberattack), human error, or accidental technological failure. Cyberattacks are designed to electronically circumvent network security for malicious purposes such as unlawfully obtaining personal information, disrupting our ability to offer services, damaging our brand and reputation, stealing our intellectual property, or advancing social or political agendas. We face a variety of cyberattack threats including computer viruses, malicious codes, worms, phishing attacks, social engineering, denial of service attacks, ransomware, and other sophisticated attacks.Although we use security and business controls to limit access to and use of personal information and expend significant resources to maintain multiple levels of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate the risk of a security breach, such measures cannot provide absolute security. We regularly test our systems to discover and address potential vulnerabilities, and we rely on training and testing of our employees regarding heightened phishing and social engineering threats. We also conduct certain background checks on our employees, as allowed by law, and limit access to systems and data. Due to the structure of our business model, we also rely on our franchisees and other private and governmental third parties to maintain secure systems and respond to cybersecurity risks. Where appropriate, we impose certain requirements and controls on these third parties, but it is possible that they may not appropriately employ these controls or that such controls (or their own separate requirements and controls) may be insufficient to protect personal information. Cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes, and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. As risks and regulations continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities. Notwithstanding these efforts, there can be no assurance that a security breach, intrusion, or loss or theft of personal information will not occur. In addition, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently, become more sophisticated, and are often difficult to detect until after a successful attack, causing us to be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in all cases. Although we generally seek to maintain insurance from time to time that might mitigate some of our damages in the event of a significant security breach or cyberattack, we would still be exposed to damages in the amounts of our deductibles, retentions, and for losses outside of the scope of our policies (e.g., reputational harm). Furthermore, insurance against cybersecurity risks may cease to be available to us in the future or the pricing of such insurance may be prohibitively expensive.A breach of our security measures or those of our franchisees or third parties on whom we rely, or other fraudulent activity, could result in unauthorized access to personal information of our clients or employees or other sensitive, nonpublic information. If such an event were to occur, it could have serious short- and long-term negative 122020 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.consequences. Unauthorized access to personal information could cause us to determine that it is required or advisable for us to notify affected individuals, regulators, or others under applicable privacy laws and regulations. Security breach remediation could also require us to expend significant resources to assist impacted individuals, repair damaged systems, implement modified information security measures, and maintain client and business relationships. Other consequences could include reduced client demand for our services and products, loss of valuable intellectual property, reduced growth and profitability and negative impacts to future financial results, loss of our ability to deliver one or more services or products (e.g., inability to provide financial services and products or to accept and process client credit card transactions or tax returns), modifying or stopping existing business practices, legal actions, harm to our reputation and brands, fines, penalties, and other damages, and further regulation and oversight by U.S. federal, state, or foreign governmental authorities.A security breach or other unauthorized access to our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Identity theft or other fraud that impedes our clients' ability to file their tax returns and receive their tax refunds could diminish consumers' perceptions of the security and reliability of our services and products, resulting in negative publicity. A person with malicious intent could obtain user account and password information from our clients through hacking, phishing, or other means of cyberattack, in order to electronically file fraudulent federal and state tax returns through our systems. Though we offer assistance in the refund recovery process and offer our TIS product to help protect clients, stolen identity refund fraud or other fraud could impede our clients' ability to timely and successfully file their returns and receive their tax refunds, and could diminish consumers' perceptions of the security and reliability of our services and products, resulting in negative publicity, despite there having been no breach in the security of our systems. Federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate have taken action, and may in the future take additional action, in an attempt to combat identity theft or other fraud, which may require changes to our systems and business practices, that we cannot anticipate. These actions may have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.A number of companies, including some in the tax return preparation industry, have reported instances where criminals gained unauthorized and illegal access to consumer information or user accounts maintained on their systems by using stolen identity information (e.g., email, username, password information, or credit history) obtained from third-party sources. We have experienced, and in the future may continue to experience, this form of unauthorized and illegal access to our systems, despite there having been no breach in the security of our systems. Such events could negatively impact our clients and harm our revenue, results of operations, and reputation. Additionally, if such unauthorized or illegal access occurs, we may be subject to claims and litigation by clients, non-clients, or governmental agencies.An interruption in our information systems, or those of our franchisees or a third party on which we rely, or an interruption in the internet, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.We, our franchisees, and other third parties involved in our business operations rely heavily upon communications, networks, and information systems and the internet to conduct our business, including third-party internet-based or cloud computing services. These networks, systems, and operations are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from upgrades and maintenance, network failure, hardware failure, software failure, power or telecommunications failures, cyberattacks (e.g., through computer viruses and worms, malicious code, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, information security breaches, or other negative disruptions to the operation of the internet), human error, and natural disasters. As our businesses are seasonal, our systems must be capable of processing high volumes during our peak periods. Therefore, any failure or interruption in our information systems, or information systems of our franchisees or a private or government third party on which we rely, or an interruption in the internet or other critical business capability, could negatively impact our business operations and reputation, and increase our risk of loss.There can be no assurance that system or internet failures or interruptions in critical business capabilities will not occur, or, if they do occur, that we, our franchisees or the private or governmental third parties on whom we rely, will H&R Block, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K13adequately address them. The precautionary measures that we have implemented to avoid systems outages and to minimize the effects of any data or communication systems interruptions or failures may not be adequate in all circumstances, and we may not have anticipated or addressed all of the potential events that could threaten or undermine our information systems or other critical business capabilities. We do not have redundancy for all of our systems and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. Our software and computer systems utilize data processing and storage capabilities provided by Microsoft Corporation. If the Microsoft Azure Cloud is unavailable for any reason, it could negatively impact our ability to deliver our services and products and our clients may not be able to access certain of our cloud products or features, any of which could significantly impact our operations, business, and financial results.The occurrence of any systems or internet failure, or business interruption could negatively impact our ability to serve our clients, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB to administer and, in some cases, enforce U.S. federal financial consumer protection laws and expanded the role of state regulators with respect to consumer protection laws. Regulations promulgated by the CFPB or other regulators may affect our financial services businesses in ways we cannot predict, which may require changes to our financial products, services, and contracts.The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB and gave it broad powers to administer, investigate compliance with, and, in some cases, enforce U.S. federal financial consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of financial consumer protection laws that apply to banks and other financial services companies, including the authority to prohibit ""unfair, deceptive, or abusive"" acts and practices.The CFPB and state regulators may examine, investigate, and take enforcement actions against our subsidiaries that provide consumer financial services and products, as well as financial institutions and service providers upon which our subsidiaries rely to provide consumer financial services and products. The Dodd-Frank Act also expanded the role of state regulators in enforcing and promulgating financial consumer protection laws, the results of which could be (i) states issuing new and broader financial consumer protection laws, some of which could be more comprehensive than existing U.S. federal regulations, or (ii) state attorneys general bringing actions to enforce federal consumer protection laws in the absence of CFPB action.Currently proposed or new CFPB and state regulations may require changes to our financial products, services and contracts, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The nature of our tax service and product offerings requires timely product launches. Any significant delays in launching our tax service and product offerings, changes in government regulations or processes that affect how we provide such offerings to our clients, or significant problems with such offerings or the manner in which we provide them to our clients may harm our revenue, results of operations, and reputation.Tax laws and tax forms are subject to change each year, and the nature and timing of such changes are unpredictable. As a part of our business, we must incorporate any changes to tax laws and tax forms into our tax service and product offerings, including our online and mobile applications and desktop software. The unpredictable nature, timing and effective dates of changes to tax laws and tax forms can result in condensed development cycles for our tax service and product offerings because our clients expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of such offerings to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline and, in turn, receive any tax refund amounts on a timely basis. In addition, governmental authorities regularly change their processes for accepting tax filings and related tax forms. Further, changes in governmental administrations or regulations could result in a delay of the start of the tax season or in further and unanticipated changes in requirements or processes. New or changed governmental regulations and processes that affect how we provide services and products to our clients may require us to make corresponding changes to our client service systems and procedures. Furthermore, unanticipated changes in governmental processes, or newly implemented processes, for (1) accepting tax filings and related forms, including the ability of taxing authorities to accept electronic tax return filings, or (2) distributing tax refunds or other amounts to clients may result in delays in our processing of our clients' tax filings, or delays in tax authorities accepting electronic tax return filings, and, in turn, delay any tax refund or other amounts to which such clients may be entitled. From time to time, we review and enhance our quality controls for preparing accurate tax returns, but there can be no assurance that we 142020 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.will be able to prevent all inaccuracies. Any significant delays in launching our tax service and product offerings, changes in government regulations or processes that affect how we provide such offerings to our clients, or significant problems with such offerings or the manner in which we provide them to our clients may harm our revenue, results of operations, and reputation.If we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our systems, services or products, we may elect to delay or suspend our offerings. Any major defects or launch delays, or unanticipated changes in governmental processes, or newly implemented processes, for (1) accepting tax filings and related forms, or (2) distributing tax refunds or other amounts to clients may lead to loss of clients and revenue, negative publicity, client and employee dissatisfaction, a deterioration in our business relationships with our franchisees, reduced retailer shelf space and promotions, exposure to litigation, and increased operating expenses, even if any such launch delays or defects are not caused by us. Any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Regulatory actions could have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The Company is subject to additional federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, in the areas of franchise, labor, immigration, advertising, consumer protection, financial services and products, payment processing, privacy and data security, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety, insurance, and healthcare. There have been significant new regulations and heightened focus by the government in some of these areas, including, for example, consumer financial services and products, restrictive covenants, and labor, including overtime and exemption regulations and state and local laws on minimum wage and other labor-related issues. There may be additional regulatory actions or enforcement priorities, or new interpretations of existing requirements that differ from ours. These developments could impose unanticipated limitations or require changes to our business, which may make elements of our business more expensive, less efficient, or impossible to conduct, and may require us to modify our current or future services or products, which effects may be heightened given the nature, broad geographic scope, and seasonality of our business.We rely on a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key services or products, and the inability of these key vendors to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Historically, we have contracted, and in the future we will likely continue to contract, with a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key services or products for our tax, financial, and other services and products. A few examples of this type of reliance are our relationships with Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (FIS), for data processing and card production services, our banking partner, for the issuance of RTs, EAs, RAs and Emerald Cards, and Microsoft Corporation, for cloud computing services. In certain instances, we are vulnerable to vendor error, service inefficiencies, service interruptions, or service delays. Our sensitivity to any of these issues may be heightened (1) due to the seasonality of our business, (2) with respect to any vendor that we utilize for the provision of any product or service that has specialized expertise, (3) with respect to any vendor that is a sole or exclusive provider, or (4) with respect to any vendor whose indemnification obligations are limited or that does not have the financial capacity to satisfy its indemnification obligations. Some of our vendors are subject to the oversight of regulatory bodies and, as a result, our product or service offerings may be affected by the actions or decisions of such regulatory bodies. Vendor failures could occur in various ways including (1) vendor error, (2) inability to meet our needs in a timely manner, or (3) termination or delay in the services or products provided by a vendor because the vendor fails to perform adequately, is no longer in business, experiences shortages, or discontinues a certain product or service that we utilize. If our vendors are unable to meet our needs and we are not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and cost-effectively, it could result in a material and adverse impact on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The specialized and highly seasonal nature of our business presents financial risks and operational and human capital challenges, which, if not satisfactorily addressed, could materially affect our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Our business is highly seasonal, with the substantial portion of our revenue generally earned in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The concentration of our revenue-generating activity during this relatively short period presents a H&R Block, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K15number of challenges for us, including (1) cash and resource management during the first nine months of our fiscal year, when we generally operate at a loss and incur fixed costs and costs of preparing for the upcoming tax season, (2) ensuring compliance with financial covenants under our CLOC, particularly if the timing of our revenue generation deviates from this seasonal period, (3) responding to changes in competitive conditions, including marketing, pricing, and new product offerings, which could affect our position during the tax season, (4) disruptions in a tax season, including any pandemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, which may disproportionately affect us compared to other companies if they occur during our fiscal fourth quarter, (5) client dissatisfaction issues or negative social media campaigns, which may not be timely discovered or satisfactorily addressed, and (6) ensuring optimal uninterrupted operations and service delivery during the tax season. If we experience significant business disruptions during the tax season or if we are unable to satisfactorily address the challenges described above and related challenges associated with a seasonal business, we could experience a loss, disruption, or change in timing of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Our business depends on our ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain key personnel in a timely manner, including members of our executive team and those in seasonal tax preparation positions or with other required specialized expertise, including technical positions. The market for such personnel is extremely competitive, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain the required personnel within necessary timeframes. If we are unable to attract, develop, motivate, and retain key personnel, our business, operations, and financial results could be negatively impacted. In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations are adopted or implemented that impact our seasonal workforce and increase our labor costs, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.We face legal actions in connection with our various business activities, and current or future legal actions may damage our reputation, impair our product offerings, or result in material liabilities and losses.We have been named, and from time to time will likely continue to be named, in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class or representative actions, actions or inquiries by state attorneys general and other regulators, and other litigation arising in connection with our various business activities, including relating to our various service and product offerings. For example, we are subject to litigation and have received and are responding to certain governmental inquiries relating to the IRS Free File program. See additional discussion in Item 8, note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. We also grant our franchisees a limited license to use our registered trademarks and, accordingly, there is risk that one or more of the franchisees may be alleged to be controlled by us. Third parties, regulators or courts may seek to hold us responsible for the actions or failures to act by our franchisees. Adverse outcomes related to legal actions could result in substantial damages and could cause our earnings to decline. Negative public opinion could also result from our or our franchisees' actual or alleged conduct in such claims, possibly damaging our reputation, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business prospects and cause the market price of our securities to decline.The continued payment of dividends on our common stock and repurchases of our common stock are dependent on a number of factors, and future payments and repurchases cannot be assured.We need liquidity sufficient to fund payments of dividends on our common stock and repurchases of our common stock. In addition, holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments, and our Board of Directors may only authorize the Company to repurchase shares of our common stock with funds legally available for such repurchases. The payment of future dividends and future repurchases will depend upon our earnings, economic conditions, liquidity and capital requirements, and other factors, including our debt leverage. Even if we have sufficient resources to pay dividends and to repurchase shares of our common stock, the Board of Directors may determine to use such resources to fund other Company initiatives. Accordingly, we cannot make any assurance that future dividends will be paid, or future repurchases will be made, at levels comparable to our historical practices, if at all. In addition, payments of dividends negatively impact net worth. Due to the seasonal nature of our business and the fact that our business is not asset-intensive, we have had, and are likely to continue to have, a negative net worth under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) at various times throughout the year. Therefore, the payment of dividends or stock repurchases at such times would cause us to further increase that GAAP negative net worth.162020 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.Our businesses may be adversely affected by difficult economic conditions and high unemployment levels, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.Given that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant economic slowdown, it appears increasingly likely that it could cause a global recession, which could be of an unknown duration. Difficult economic conditions are frequently characterized by high unemployment levels and declining consumer and business spending. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased levels of unemployment globally, which may be sustained. These poor economic conditions may negatively affect demand and pricing for our services and products. In the event of difficult economic conditions that include high unemployment levels, especially within the client segments we serve, clients may elect not to file tax returns or utilize lower cost preparation and filing alternatives. In addition, difficult economic conditions may disproportionately impact small business owners. Wave’s revenues have been negatively impacted, and may continue to be negatively impacted if there is a sustained economic slowdown or recession as a result of the pandemic. Difficult economic conditions, including an economic recession resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Our business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands.Developing and maintaining awareness of our brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and products and is an important element in attracting new clients. In addition, our franchisees may operate their businesses under our brands. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to events or activities involving or attributed to us, our franchisees, employees, or agents or our services or products, which may be enhanced due to the nature of social media, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our services and products and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands.Failure to protect our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third party allegations of infringement may be costly.Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information, we may be unable to do so effectively in all cases. Our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyberattack, other wrongful conduct by employees or third parties, or human error. To the extent that our intellectual property is not protected effectively by trademarks, copyrights, patents, or other means, other parties with knowledge of our intellectual property, including former employees, may seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own or others' advantage. Competitors may also misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights or duplicate our technology and products. Any significant impairment or misappropriation of our intellectual property or proprietary information could harm our business and our brand, and may adversely affect our ability to compete.In addition, third parties may allege we are infringing their intellectual property rights, and we may face intellectual property challenges from other parties. We may not be successful in defending against any such challenges or in obtaining licenses to avoid or resolve any intellectual property disputes and, in that event, we could lose significant revenues, incur significant royalty or technology development expenses, suffer harm to our reputation, or pay significant monetary damages.Failure to maintain sound business relationships with our franchisees may have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Our financial success depends in significant part on our ability to maintain sound business relationships with our franchisees. The support of our franchisees is also critical for the success of our ongoing operations. Deterioration in our relationships with our franchisees could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Our international operations are subject to risks which may harm our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.We have international operations, including tax preparation businesses in Canada and Australia, technology centers in India and Ireland, and Wave in Canada. We may consider expansion opportunities in additional countries in the H&R Block, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K17future and there is uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from new or emerging foreign operations and expand into other international markets. Additionally, there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including: (1) changes in trade regulations; (2) difficulties in managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences; (3) profit repatriation restrictions, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; (4) geopolitical events, including acts of war and terrorism, and economic and political instability; (5) compliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable foreign anti-corruption laws; (6) compliance with U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those concerning privacy, and data protection and retention; and (7) risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws. These risks inherent in our international operations and expansion could increase our costs of doing business internationally and could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.In addition, we prepare U.S. federal and state tax returns for taxpayers residing in foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union (EU), and we operate and have franchisees who operate in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, certain aspects of our operations are subject, or may in the future become subject, to the laws, regulations, and policies of those jurisdictions that regulate the collection, use, and transfer of personal information, which may be more stringent than those of the U.S. For example, in May 2018, the EU implemented a privacy and data protection regulation, referred to as the General Data Protection Regulation.Costs for us to comply with such laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to us could be significant.  We may also face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to these laws, regulations, and policies that could result in the imposition of penalties or fines.Changes in tax laws or regulations, or in the interpretations of tax laws or regulations, could materially affect our financial condition, cash flows, and operating results.As a multinational corporation, we are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions where our subsidiaries are organized and conduct their operations. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. The amount of tax due in various jurisdictions may change significantly as a result of political or economic factors beyond our control, including changes to tax laws or new interpretations of existing laws that are inconsistent with previous interpretations or positions taken by taxing authorities on which we have relied. For example, in 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation), which made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code. Given the lack of regulatory guidance regarding the Tax Legislation, regulatory interpretations that differ from our existing interpretations of the Tax Legislation could materially affect our effective tax rates or value of deferred tax assets and liabilities. More recently, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act includes, among other items, provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of certain tax payments, and modifications to the net interest deduction limitations. We are currently evaluating the impact of the CARES Act and expect additional regulations, interpretations, and rulings may be forthcoming that could further impact our consolidated financial statements. In addition, legislatures and taxing authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate may propose additional changes to their tax rules in response to COVID-19. The impact of these potential new rules could be material.In addition, projects undertaken by international organizations may change international tax norms relating to each country’s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade. Given the unpredictability of these and other possible changes to tax laws and related regulations, it is difficult to assess the overall effect of such potential changes, but any such changes could, if adopted and applicable to us, adversely impact our effective tax rates and other tax liabilities.Our tax returns and other tax matters are periodically examined by tax authorities and governmental bodies, including the IRS, which may disagree with positions taken by us in determining our tax liability. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes.If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.182020 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.RISKS RELATING TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSSand Canyon Corporation, previously known as Option One Mortgage Corporation (including its subsidiaries, collectively, SCC) is subject to litigation and other claims, including potential contingent losses related to securitization transactions in which SCC participated, which may result in significant financial losses. Although SCC ceased its mortgage loan origination activities in December 2007 and sold its loan servicing business in April 2008, SCC has been, remains, and may in the future be, subject to litigation, claims, including indemnification and contribution claims, and other loss contingencies pertaining to SCC's mortgage business activities that occurred prior to such termination and sale. See Item 8, note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of litigation and other claims to which SCC may be subject.Between January 2005 and November 2007, SCC originated mortgage loans totaling approximately $80 billion. Mortgage loans originated by SCC were sold either as whole loans to single third-party buyers, who generally securitized such loans, or in the form of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs). SCC estimates approximately 90% of the loans it originated in 2005, 2006, and 2007 were securitized in approximately 110 securitization transactions. In connection with the sale of loans or RMBSs, SCC made certain representations and warranties. Claims under these representations and warranties together with any settlement arrangements related to these losses are collectively referred to as ""representation and warranty claims."" The statute of limitations for a contractual claim to enforce a representation and warranty obligation is generally six years or such shorter limitations period that may apply under the law of a state where the economic injury occurred. On June 11, 2015, the New York Court of Appeals, New York's highest court, held in ACE Securities Corp. v. DB Structured Products, Inc. (ACE), that the six-year statute of limitations under New York law starts to run at the time the representations and warranties are made, not the date when the repurchase demand was denied. This decision applies to claims and lawsuits brought against SCC where New York law governs. New York law governs many, though not all, of the transactions into which SCC entered. However, this decision would not affect representation and warranty claims and lawsuits SCC has received or may receive, for example, where the statute of limitations has been tolled by agreement or a suit was timely filed. In response to the statute of limitations rulings in the ACE case and similar rulings in other state and federal courts, parties seeking to pursue representation and warranty claims or lawsuits have sought, and may in the future seek, to distinguish certain aspects of the ACE decision, pursue alternate legal theories of recovery, or assert claims against other contractual parties such as securitization trustees. For example, a 2016 ruling by a New York intermediate appellate court, followed by the federal district court in the second Homeward case described in Item 8, note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, allowed a counterparty to pursue litigation on additional loans in the same trust even though only some of the loans complied with the condition precedent of timely pre-suit notice and opportunity to cure or repurchase. Additionally, plaintiffs in litigation to which SCC is not party have alleged breaches of an independent contractual duty to provide notice of material breaches of representations and warranties and pursued separate claims to which, they argue, the statute of limitations ruling in the ACE case does not apply. The impact on SCC from alternative legal theories seeking to avoid or distinguish the ACE decision, or judicial limitations on the ACE decision, is unclear.In most of the securitization transactions in which SCC participated, SCC agreed, subject to certain conditions and limitations, to indemnify contracting parties, including underwriters, depositors, or securitization trustees for certain losses and expenses that such parties may incur as a result of certain claims made against them relating to loans originated by SCC, including certain legal expenses they may incur in their defense of such claims.Some underwriters, depositors, and securitization trustees are, or have been, defendants in lawsuits, threatened lawsuits, and settlements related to securitization transactions in which SCC participated. A variety of claims are alleged in these matters, including violations of U.S. federal and state securities law and common law fraud based on alleged materially inaccurate or misleading disclosures, that originators, depositors, securitization trustees, servicers, or other parties breached their representations and warranties or otherwise failed to fulfill their obligations, or that securitization trustees violated statutory requirements by failing to properly protect the certificate holders’ interests. SCC has received notices of claims for indemnification or potential indemnification obligations relating to such matters. Certain of the notices received included, and future notices may include, a reservation of rights to assert claims for H&R Block, Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K19contribution, which are referred to herein as ""contribution claims."" Contribution claims may become operative if indemnification is unavailable or insufficient to cover all of the losses and expenses involved. These indemnification and contribution claims are frequently not subject to a contractual term or limit. Additional lawsuits against parties to the securitization transactions may be filed in the future, and SCC may receive additional notices of claims for indemnification, contribution, or similar obligations with respect to existing or new lawsuits or settlements of such lawsuits or other claims.In addition, other counterparties to the securitization transactions, including certificate holders and monoline insurance companies, have filed or may file lawsuits, or may assert indemnification or contribution claims, directly against depositors and loan originators in securitization transactions alleging a variety of claims, including U.S. federal and state securities law violations, common law torts and fraud and breach of contract claims, among others. Additional or new lawsuits or claims may be filed or asserted against SCC in the future. We have not concluded that a loss related to these matters is probable, nor have we accrued a liability for these claims as of April 30, 2020. However, if SCC were required to pay material amounts with respect to these matters, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows, as SCC's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows are included in our consolidated financial statements. See Item 8, note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.H&R Block guaranteed the payment of certain limited claims against SCC.SCC has been subject to representation and warranty claims by counterparties to SCC whole loan sales and securitization transactions, including certificate holders, securitization trustees, and subsequent purchasers of whole loans. In certain limited circumstances, H&R Block guaranteed payment if claims are successfully asserted by such counterparties.In addition, as is customary in divestiture transactions, H&R Block guaranteed the payment of any indemnification claims from the purchaser of SCC's servicing business, including claims relating to pre-closing services (closing occurred in 2008).We could be subject to claims by the creditors of SCC.As discussed above, SCC is subject to representation and warranty claims, indemnification and contribution claims, and other claims and litigation related to its past sales and securitizations of mortgage loans. Additional claims and litigation may be asserted in the future. If the amount that SCC is ultimately required to pay with respect to these claims and litigation, together with related administration and legal expense, exceeds its net assets, the creditors of SCC, or a bankruptcy trustee if SCC were to file or be forced into bankruptcy, may attempt to assert claims against us for payment of SCC's obligations. Claimants have also attempted, and may in the future attempt, to assert claims or seek payment directly from the Company even if SCC's assets exceed its liabilities. SCC's principal assets, as of April 30, 2020, total approximately $276 million and consist of an intercompany note receivable. We believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate veil-piercing arguments; however, if this position is challenged and not upheld, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, in certain limited instances, H&R Block guaranteed amounts as outlined in the above risk factor"
8,HRB,BLOCK H & R INC,2019-06-14,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business activities expose us to a variety of risks. Identification, monitoring, and management of these risks are essential to the success of our operations and the financial soundness of H&R Block. Senior management and the Board of Directors, acting as a whole and through its committees, take an active role in our risk management process and have delegated certain activities related to the oversight of risk management to the Company's Enterprise Risk Management department and the Enterprise Risk Committee, which is comprised of Vice Presidents and senior directors of major businesses and control functions. The Company’s Enterprise Risk Management department, working in coordination with the Enterprise Risk Committee, is responsible for identifying and monitoring risk exposures and related mitigation and leading the continued development of our risk management policies and practices. An investment in our securities involves risk, including the risk that the value of that investment may decline or that returns on that investment may fall below expectations. There are a number of significant factors that could cause actual conditions, events, or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, many of which are beyond management's control or its ability to accurately estimate or predict, or that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and the value of an investment in our securities.RISKS RELATING TO CONTINUING OPERATIONSChanges in applicable tax laws may have a negative impact on the demand for and pricing of our services, which could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The U.S. government has in the past made, and may in the future make, changes to the individual income tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, taxing authorities in various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may change the income tax laws in their respective jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict the manner in which future changes to the Internal Revenue Code and state, local, and foreign tax laws may impact us and the tax return preparation industry. Such future changes could decrease the demand or the amount we charge for our services, and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.There are various other initiatives from time to time seeking to modify the Internal Revenue Code or otherwise simplify tax return preparation. In addition, taxing authorities in various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have also introduced measures seeking to simplify or otherwise modify the preparation and filing of tax returns in their respective jurisdictions. The adoption or expansion of any measures that significantly simplify tax return preparation, expedite refunds, or otherwise reduce the need for third-party tax return preparation services could reduce demand for our services and products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Increased competition for tax preparation clients could adversely affect our current market share and profitability. Offers of free tax preparation services could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.We provide assisted, DIY, and virtual tax preparation services and products and face substantial competition throughout our businesses. All categories in the tax return preparation industry are highly competitive and additional competitors have entered, and in the future may enter, the market to provide tax preparation services or products. In the assisted tax services category, there are a substantial number of tax return preparation firms and accounting firms offering tax return preparation services. Commercial tax return preparers are highly competitive with regard to price and service. In the DIY and virtual categories, options include various forms of digital electronic assistance, including online and mobile applications, and desktop software, all of which we offer. Our DIY and virtual services and products compete with a number of online and software companies, primarily on price and functionality. Individual tax filers may elect to change their tax preparation method, choosing from among various assisted, DIY, and virtual offerings, and technology increasingly makes switching among tax preparers and tax preparation methods easier for those consumers. Technology advances quickly and in new and unexpected ways, and it is difficult to predict the manner in which these changes will impact the tax return preparation industry, the problems we may encounter in enhancing our services and products or the time and resources we may need to devote to the creation, support, and maintenance of technological enhancements. If we are slow to enhance our services, products, or technologies, if our competitors are able to achieve results more quickly than us, or if there are new and unexpected entrants into the industry, we may fail to capture, or lose, a significant share of the market. Additionally, we and many other tax return preparation firms are involved in providing one or more of RTs, prepaid cards, RAs, other financial services and products, and other H&R Block, Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K7Table of Contentstax-related services and products, many of which are subject to regulatory scrutiny, litigation, and other risks. We can make no assurances that we will be able to offer, or continue to offer, all of these services and products and a failure to do so could negatively impact our financial results and ability to compete. Intense competition could result in a reduction of our market share, lower revenues, lower margins, and lower profitability. U.S. federal, state and foreign governmental authorities in certain jurisdictions in which we operate currently offer, or facilitate the offering of, tax return preparation and electronic filing options to taxpayers at no charge, and certain volunteer organizations also prepare tax returns at no charge for low-income taxpayers. In addition, many of our competitors offer certain tax preparation services and products at no charge. In order to compete, we have offered certain, and may in the future offer additional, tax preparation services and related products at no charge. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract clients or effectively ensure the migration of clients from our free tax service offerings to those for which we receive fees, and clients who have formerly paid for our tax service offerings may elect to use free offerings instead. These competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability, or harm our ability to acquire and retain clients.Government tax authorities, volunteer organizations, and our competitors may also elect to implement or expand free offerings in the future. Free File, Inc., which exists under an agreement that expires in October 2021, is currently the sole means by which the IRS offers DIY tax software to taxpayers. If the Free File program is terminated and the IRS itself provides tax preparation services, the federal government would become our direct competitor, which could potentially have material adverse revenue implications.In addition, from time to time, U.S. federal and state governments have considered various proposals through which the respective governmental taxing authorities would use taxpayer information provided by employers, financial institutions, and other payers to ""pre-populate,"" prepare and calculate tax returns and distribute them to taxpayers. Under this approach, the taxpayer could then review and contest the return or sign and return it, reducing the need for third-party tax return preparation services and the demand for our services and products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. There are various initiatives from time to time seeking to expedite refunds, which could reduce the demand for RTs. In addition, the IRS has in the past explored the possibility of allowing taxpayers to allocate a portion of their tax refunds to pay tax preparation fees, but the IRS has not advanced this initiative. We believe that governmental encroachment at both the U.S. federal and state levels, as well as comparable government levels in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, could present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future.Compliance with the complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection could require changes in our business practices and increase costs of operation; failure to comply with such laws could result in significant claims, fines, penalties, and damages.In the course of our business, we collect, use, and retain large amounts of personal information and data from our clients, including tax return information, financial product and service information, and social security numbers. In addition, we collect, use and retain personal information and data of our employees in the ordinary course of our business. We are subject to laws, rules, and regulations relating to the collection, use, disclosure, and security of such consumer and employee personal information, which have drawn increased attention from U.S. federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate. In the U.S., the IRS generally requires a tax return preparer to obtain the prior written consent of the taxpayer to use or disclose the taxpayer's information for certain purposes other than tax return preparation, which may limit our ability to market revenue-generating products to our clients. In addition, other regulations require financial institutions to adopt and disclose their consumer privacy notice and generally provide consumers with a reasonable opportunity to ""opt-out"" of having nonpublic personal information disclosed to unaffiliated third parties. Numerous jurisdictions have passed, and may in the future pass, new laws related to the use and retention of consumer information and this area continues to be an area of interest for U.S. federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities. For example, the State of California has adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act, which will become effective January 1, 2020 and imposes new requirements on how businesses collect, process, manage, and retain certain personal information of California residents, and other states have proposed and may adopt their own, different consumer privacy laws. These laws may contain different requirements and may be interpreted and applied 82019 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.Table of Contentsinconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Our current privacy and data protection policies and practices may not be consistent with all of those requirements, interpretations, or applications. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state regulatory requirements, as well as requirements imposed by governmental authorities in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, could result in more stringent requirements and in a need to change business practices, including the types of information we can use and the manner in which we can use such information. Establishing systems and processes, or making changes to our existing policies, to achieve compliance with these complex and evolving requirements may increase our costs or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses to comply with existing privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations.A security breach of our systems, or third-party systems on which we rely, resulting in unauthorized access to personal information of our clients or employees or other sensitive, nonpublic information, may adversely affect the demand for our services and products, our reputation, and financial performance.We offer a range of services and products to our clients, including assisted, DIY, and virtual tax return preparation solutions, and financial products and services. Due to the nature of these services and products, we use multiple digital technologies to collect, transmit, and store high volumes of client personal information. We also host, collect, use, and retain other sensitive, nonpublic information, such as employee social security numbers, healthcare information, and payroll information, as well as confidential, nonpublic business information. Certain third parties and vendors have access to personal information to help deliver client benefits and products, or may host certain of our and our clients’ sensitive and personal information and data. Information security risks continue to increase due in part to the increased adoption of and reliance upon digital technologies by companies and consumers. Our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened due to a variety of factors including, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats and related regulation, the increased activity and sophistication of nation states, organized crime, cyber criminals, and hackers, the prominence of our brand, our and our franchisees' extensive office footprint, our plans to continue to implement strategies for our online and mobile applications and our desktop software, and our use of third-party vendors.Cybersecurity risks may result from fraud or malice (a cyberattack), human error, or accidental technological failure. Cyberattacks are designed to electronically circumvent network security for malicious purposes such as unlawfully obtaining personal information, disrupting our ability to offer services, damaging our brand and reputation, stealing our intellectual property, and advancing social or political agendas. We face a variety of cyberattack threats including computer viruses, malicious codes, worms, phishing attacks, social engineering, denial of service attacks, ransomware, and other sophisticated attacks.Although we use security and business controls to limit access to and use of personal information and expend significant resources to maintain multiple levels of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate the risk of a security breach, such measures cannot provide absolute security. We regularly test our systems to discover and address potential vulnerabilities, and we rely on training and testing of our employees regarding heightened phishing and social engineering threats. We also conduct certain employee background checks on our employees, as allowed by law, and limit access to systems and data. Due to the structure of our business model, we also rely on our franchisees and other private and governmental third parties to maintain secure systems and respond to cybersecurity risks. We impose certain requirements and controls on these third parties, but it is possible that they may not appropriately employ the controls that we require of them or that such controls may be insufficient to protect personal information. Cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes, and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access remain a high priority for us. As risks and regulations continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities. Notwithstanding these efforts, there can be no assurance that a security breach, intrusion, or loss or theft of personal information will not occur. In addition, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently, become more sophisticated, and are often difficult to detect until after a successful attack, causing us to be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. Although we generally seek to maintain insurance from time to time that might mitigate some of our damages in the event of a significant security breach or cyberattack, we would still be exposed to damages in the amounts of our deductibles, retentions, and for losses outside of the scope of our policies (e.g., reputational harm). Furthermore, insurance against H&R Block, Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K9Table of Contentscybersecurity risks may cease to be available to us in the future or the pricing of such insurance may be prohibitively expensive.A breach of our security measures or those of our franchisees or third parties on whom we rely, or other fraudulent activity, could result in unauthorized access to personal information of our clients or employees or other sensitive, nonpublic information. If such an event were to occur, it could have serious short- and long-term negative consequences. Unauthorized access to personal information could cause us to determine that it is required or advisable for us to notify affected individuals, regulators, or others under applicable privacy laws and regulations. Security breach remediation could also require us to expend significant resources to assist impacted individuals, repair damaged systems, implement modified information security measures, and maintain client and business relationships. Other consequences could include reduced client demand for our services and products, loss of valuable intellectual property, reduced growth and profitability and negative impacts to future financial results, loss of our ability to deliver one or more services or products (e.g., inability to provide financial products and services or to accept and process client credit card transactions or tax returns), modifying or stopping existing business practices, legal actions, harm to our reputation and brands, fines, penalties, and other damages, and further regulation and oversight by U.S. federal, state, or foreign governmental authorities.A security breach or other unauthorized access to our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Stolen identity refund fraud and other fraud could impede our clients' ability to timely and successfully file their tax returns and receive their tax refunds, and could diminish consumers' perceptions of the security and reliability of our products and services, resulting in negative publicity. Increased governmental regulation to attempt to combat fraud could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.Companies offering tax preparation services (especially those offering DIY solutions) are at risk of criminals utilizing stolen information obtained through hacking, phishing, and other means of identity theft in order to electronically file fraudulent federal and state tax returns. As a result, impacted taxpayers must complete additional forms and go through additional steps in order to report to appropriate authorities that their identities have been stolen and their tax returns were filed fraudulently. Though we offer assistance in the refund recovery process and offer our TIS product to help protect clients, stolen identity refund fraud could impede our clients' ability to timely and successfully file their returns and receive their tax refunds, and could diminish consumers' perceptions of the security and reliability of our products and services, resulting in negative publicity, despite there having been no breach in the security of our systems. In addition, if stolen identity refund fraud is perpetrated at a material level through our products or services, state, federal, or foreign tax authorities may refuse to allow us to continue to process our clients' tax returns electronically. As a result, stolen identity refund fraud could harm our revenue, results of operations, and reputation.Federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate have taken action, and may in the future take additional action, in an attempt to combat stolen identity refund fraud, which may require changes to our systems and business practices, that we cannot anticipate. These actions may have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Our clients may access our services and products from personal or public computers and mobile devices and may install and use our DIY desktop software on their computers. Those computers and other devices may have outdated systems, may run software that is no longer supported, or may not have security patches installed on a timely basis. Due to these and other factors, a person with malicious intent could obtain user account and password information from our clients through hacking, phishing, or other means of cyberattack, in order to perpetrate stolen identity refund fraud and other crimes against our clients. A number of companies, including some in the tax return preparation industry, have reported instances where criminals gained unauthorized and illegal access to their systems by using stolen identity information (e.g., user account and password information) obtained from sources other than those companies. We could experience this form of unauthorized and illegal access to our systems, despite there having been no breach in the security of our systems, which could negatively impact our clients and harm our revenue, results of operations, and reputation. Additionally, if such unauthorized or illegal access occurs, we may be subject to claims and litigation by clients, non-clients, or governmental agencies.102019 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.Table of ContentsAn interruption in our information systems, or those of our franchisees or a third party on which we rely, or an interruption in the internet, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. We, our franchisees, and other third parties involved in our business operations rely heavily upon communications, networks, and information systems and the internet to conduct our business, including third-party internet-based or cloud computing services. These networks, systems, and operations are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from upgrades and maintenance, network failure, hardware failure, software failure, power or telecommunications failures, cyberattacks involving the penetration of our network by hackers or other unauthorized users (e.g., through computer viruses and worms, malicious code, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, information security breaches, or other negative disruptions to the operation of the internet), human error, and natural disasters. As our businesses are seasonal, our systems must be capable of processing high volumes during our peak periods. Therefore, any failure or interruption in our information systems, or information systems of our franchisees or a private or government third party on which we rely, or an interruption in the internet or other critical business capability, could negatively impact our business operations and reputation, and increase our risk of loss.There can be no assurance that system or internet failures, or interruptions in critical business capabilities will not occur, or, if they do occur, that we, our franchisees or the private or governmental third parties on whom we rely, will adequately address them. The precautionary measures that we have implemented to avoid systems outages and to minimize the effects of any data or communication systems interruptions or failures may not be adequate in all circumstances, and we may not have anticipated or addressed all of the potential events that could threaten or undermine our information systems or other critical business capabilities. We do not have redundancy for all of our systems and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. Our software and computer systems utilize data processing and storage capabilities provided by Microsoft Corporation. If the Microsoft Azure Cloud is unavailable for any reason, our clients may not be able to access certain of our cloud products or features, which could significantly impact our operations, business, and financial results.The occurrence of any systems or internet failure, or business interruption could negatively impact our ability to serve our clients, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB to administer and, in some cases, enforce U.S. federal financial consumer protection laws and expanded the role of state regulators with respect to consumer protection laws. Regulations promulgated by the CFPB or other regulators may affect our financial services businesses in ways we cannot predict, which may require changes to our financial products, services, and contracts.The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB and gave it broad powers to administer, investigate compliance with, and, in some cases, enforce U.S. federal financial consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of financial consumer protection laws that apply to banks and other financial services companies, including the authority to prohibit ""unfair, deceptive, or abusive"" acts and practices. The CFPB and state regulators may examine, investigate, and take enforcement actions against our subsidiaries that provide consumer financial services and products, as well as financial institutions and service providers upon which our subsidiaries rely to provide consumer financial services and products. The Dodd-Frank Act also expanded the role of state regulators in enforcing and promulgating financial consumer protection laws, the results of which could be (i) states issuing new and broader financial consumer protection laws, some of which could be more comprehensive than existing U.S. federal regulations, or (ii) state attorneys general bringing actions to enforce federal consumer protection laws in the absence of CFPB action. Currently proposed or new CFPB and state regulations may require changes to our financial products, services and contracts, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. H&R Block, Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K11Table of ContentsThe nature of our tax service and product offerings requires timely product launches. Any significant delays in launching our tax service and product offerings, changes in government regulations or processes that affect how we provide such offerings to our clients, or significant problems with such offerings or the manner in which we provide them to our clients may harm our revenue, results of operations, and reputation.Tax laws and tax forms are subject to change each year, and the nature and timing of such changes are unpredictable. As a part of our business, we must incorporate any changes to tax laws and tax forms into our tax service and product offerings, including our online and mobile applications and desktop software. The unpredictable nature, timing and effective dates of changes to tax laws and tax forms can result in condensed development cycles for our tax service and product offerings because our clients expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of such offerings to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline and, in turn, receive any tax refund amounts on a timely basis. In addition, governmental authorities regularly change their processes for accepting tax filings and related tax forms. Further, changes in governmental administrations or regulations could result in a delay of the start of the tax season or in further and unanticipated changes in requirements or processes. Changes in governmental regulations and processes that affect how we provide services and products to our clients may require us to make corresponding changes to our client service systems and procedures. Furthermore, unanticipated changes in governmental processes for accepting tax filings and related forms, or the ability of taxing authorities to accept electronic tax return filings, may result in delays in our processing of our clients' tax filings, or delays in tax authorities accepting electronic tax return filings, and, in turn, delay any tax refund amounts to which such clients may be entitled. From time to time, we review and enhance our quality controls for preparing accurate tax returns, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent all inaccuracies. Any significant delays in launching our tax service and product offerings, changes in government regulations or processes that affect how we provide such offerings to our clients, or significant problems with such offerings or the manner in which we provide them to our clients may harm our revenue, results of operations, and reputation.If we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our systems, services or products, we may elect to delay or suspend our offerings. Any major defects or launch delays, or unanticipated changes in governmental processes for accepting tax filings and related forms, may lead to loss of clients and revenue, negative publicity, client and employee dissatisfaction, a deterioration in our business relationships with our franchisees, reduced retailer shelf space and promotions, exposure to litigation, and increased operating expenses. Any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Regulatory actions could have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The Company is subject to additional federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, in the areas of franchise, labor, immigration, advertising, consumer protection, financial services and products, payment processing, privacy and data security, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety, insurance, and healthcare. There have been significant new regulations and heightened focus by the government in some of these areas, including, for example, consumer financial services and products, restrictive covenants, and labor, including overtime and exemption regulations and state and local laws on minimum wage and other labor-related issues. There may be additional regulatory actions or enforcement priorities, or new interpretations of existing requirements that differ from ours. These developments could impose unanticipated limitations or require changes to our business, which may make elements of our business more expensive, less efficient, or impossible to conduct, and may require us to modify our current or future services or products, which effects may be heightened given the nature, broad geographic scope, and seasonality of our business.We rely on a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key services or products, and the inability of these key vendors to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Historically, we have contracted, and in the future we will likely continue to contract, with a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key services or products for our tax, financial, and other services and products. A few examples of this type of reliance are our relationships with Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (FIS), for data processing and card production services, Axos, for the issuance of RTs, EAs, RAs and Emerald Cards, and Microsoft Corporation, for cloud computing services. In certain instances, we are vulnerable to vendor error, service 122019 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.Table of Contentsinefficiencies, service interruptions, or service delays. Our sensitivity to any of these issues may be heightened (1) due to the seasonality of our business, (2) with respect to any vendor that we utilize for the provision of any product or service that has specialized expertise, (3) with respect to any vendor that is a sole or exclusive provider, or (4) with respect to any vendor whose indemnification obligations are limited or that does not have the financial capacity to satisfy its indemnification obligations. Some of our vendors are subject to the oversight of regulatory bodies and, as a result, our product or service offerings may be affected by the actions or decisions of such regulatory bodies. Vendor failures could occur in various ways including (1) vendor error, (2) inability to meet our needs in a timely manner, or (3) termination or delay in the services or products provided by a vendor because the vendor fails to perform adequately, is no longer in business, experiences shortages, or discontinues a certain product or service that we utilize. If our vendors are unable to meet our needs and we are not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and cost-effectively, it could result in a material and adverse impact on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The specialized and highly seasonal nature of our business presents financial risks and operational challenges, which, if not satisfactorily addressed, could materially affect our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Our business is highly seasonal, with the substantial portion of our revenue earned in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Success in our industry depends on our ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain key personnel in a timely manner, including members of our executive team and those in seasonal tax preparation positions or with other required specialized expertise, including technical positions. The market for such personnel is extremely competitive, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain the required personnel within necessary timeframes. If we are unable to attract, develop, motivate, and retain key personnel, our business, operations, and financial results could be negatively impacted. In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations are adopted or implemented that increase our labor costs, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The concentration of our revenue-generating activity during this relatively short period presents a number of additional challenges for us, including (1) cash and resource management during the first nine months of our fiscal year, when we generally operate at a loss and incur fixed costs and costs of preparing for the upcoming tax season, (2) ensuring compliance with financial covenants under our Third Amended and Restated Credit and Guarantee Agreement (2018 CLOC), particularly if the timing of our revenue generation deviates from this seasonal period, (3) responding to changes in competitive conditions, including marketing, pricing, and new product offerings, which could affect our position during the tax season, (4) disruptions in a tax season, including any client dissatisfaction issues or negative social media campaigns, which may not be timely discovered or satisfactorily addressed, and (5) ensuring optimal uninterrupted operations and service delivery during the tax season. If we experience significant business disruptions during the tax season or if we are unable to satisfactorily address the challenges described above and related challenges associated with a seasonal business, we could experience a loss of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.We face legal actions in connection with our various business activities, and current or future legal actions may damage our reputation, impair our product offerings, or result in material liabilities and losses.We have been named, and from time to time will likely continue to be named, in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class or representative actions, actions or inquiries by state attorneys general and other regulators, and other litigation arising in connection with our various business activities, including relating to our various service and product offerings. We also grant our franchisees a limited license to use our registered trademarks and, accordingly, there is risk that one or more of the franchisees may be alleged to be controlled by us. Third parties, regulators or courts may seek to hold us responsible for the actions or failures to act by our franchisees. Adverse outcomes related to legal actions could result in substantial damages and could cause our earnings to decline. Negative public opinion could also result from our or our franchisees' actual or alleged conduct in such claims, possibly damaging our reputation, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business prospects and cause the market price of our securities to decline.H&R Block, Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K13Table of ContentsOur access to liquidity may be negatively impacted as disruptions in credit markets occur, if our credit ratings are downgraded, or if we fail to meet certain covenants. Our funding costs may increase, leading to reduced earnings.We need liquidity to meet our off-season working capital requirements, to service debt obligations including refinancing of maturing obligations, and for general corporate purposes. Our access to and the cost of liquidity could be negatively impacted in the event of credit rating downgrades or if we fail to meet existing financial covenants. Events may also occur which could increase our need for liquidity above current levels.If rating agencies downgrade our credit rating, the cost of debt under our existing financing arrangements, as well as future financing arrangements, could increase and capital market access could decrease or become unavailable. Our 2018 CLOC is subject to various covenants, and a violation of a covenant could impair our access to liquidity currently available through the 2018 CLOC. The 2018 CLOC includes provisions that allow for the issuance of equity to comply with the financial covenant calculations as a means to avoid a shortfall. If current sources of liquidity were to become unavailable, we would need to obtain additional sources of funding, which may not be available or may only be available under less favorable terms. This could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The continued payment of dividends on our common stock and repurchases of our common stock are dependent on a number of factors, and future payments and repurchases cannot be assured.We need liquidity sufficient to fund payments of dividends on our common stock and repurchases of our common stock. In addition, holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments, and our Board of Directors may only authorize the Company to repurchase shares of our common stock with funds legally available for such repurchases. The payment of future dividends and future repurchases will depend upon our earnings, economic conditions, liquidity and capital requirements, and other factors, including our debt leverage. Even if we have sufficient resources to pay dividends and to repurchase shares of our common stock, the Board of Directors may determine to use such resources to fund other Company initiatives. Accordingly, we cannot make any assurance that future dividends will be paid, or future repurchases will be made, at levels comparable to our historical practices, if at all. In addition, payments of dividends negatively impact net worth. Due to the seasonal nature of our business and the fact that our business is not asset-intensive, we have had, and are likely to continue to have, a negative net worth under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) at various times throughout the year, and thus the payment of dividends or stock repurchases causes us to further increase that GAAP negative net worth.Our businesses may be adversely affected in the event of difficult economic conditions, in particular, high unemployment levels.Difficult economic conditions are frequently characterized by high unemployment levels and declining consumer and business spending. These poor economic conditions may negatively affect demand and pricing for our services and products. In the event of difficult economic conditions that include high unemployment levels, especially within the client segments we serve, clients may elect not to file tax returns or utilize lower cost preparation and filing alternatives. Sustained levels of high unemployment may negatively impact our ability to increase or retain tax preparation clients.Our business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands.Developing and maintaining awareness of our brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and products and is an important element in attracting new clients. In addition, our franchisees may operate their businesses under our brands. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to events or activities involving or attributed to us, our franchisees, employees, or agents or our services or products, which may be enhanced due to the nature of social media, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our services and products and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands.Failure to protect our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third party allegations of infringement may be costly. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information, we may be unable to do so effectively in all cases. Our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyberattack or other 142019 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.Table of Contentswrongful conduct by employees or third parties. To the extent that our intellectual property is not protected effectively by trademarks, copyrights, patents, or other means, other parties with knowledge of our intellectual property, including former employees, may seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own or others' advantage. Competitors may also misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights or duplicate our technology and products. Any significant impairment or misappropriation of our intellectual property or proprietary information could harm our business and our brand, and may adversely affect our ability to compete. In addition, third parties may allege we are infringing their intellectual property rights, and we may face intellectual property challenges from other parties. We may not be successful in defending against any such challenges or in obtaining licenses to avoid or resolve any intellectual property disputes and, in that event, we could lose significant revenues, incur significant royalty or technology development expenses, suffer harm to our reputation, or pay significant monetary damages.Failure to maintain sound business relationships with our franchisees may have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Our financial success depends in significant part on our ability to maintain sound business relationships with our franchisees. The support of our franchisees is also critical for the success of our ongoing operations. Deterioration in our relationships with our franchisees could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Our international operations are subject to risks which may harm our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.We have international operations, including in Canada and Australia, and may consider expansion opportunities in additional countries in the future. There is uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from new or emerging foreign operations and expand into other international markets. Additionally, there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including: (1) changes in trade regulations; (2) difficulties in managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences; (3) profit repatriation restrictions, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; (4) geopolitical events, including acts of war and terrorism, and economic and political instability; (5) compliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable foreign anti-corruption laws; (6) compliance with U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those concerning privacy, and data protection and retention; and (7) risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws. These risks inherent in our international operations and expansion could increase our costs of doing business internationally and could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.In addition, we prepare U.S. federal and state tax returns for taxpayers residing in foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union (EU), and we operate and have franchisees who operate in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, certain aspects of our operations are subject, or may in the future become subject, to the laws, regulations, and policies of those jurisdictions that regulate the collection, use, and transfer of personal information, which may be more stringent than those of the U.S. For example, in May 2018, the EU implemented a new privacy and data protection regulation, known as the General Data Protection Regulation. Costs for us to comply with such laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to us could be significant.  We may also face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to these laws, regulations, and policies that could result in the imposition of penalties or fines.We may be adversely impacted by changes in corporate tax rates, the adoption of new tax legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and exposure to additional tax liabilities. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions where our subsidiaries are organized and conduct their operations. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries are organized and conduct their operations may change significantly as a result of political or economic factors beyond our control. Additionally, our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Our tax returns and other tax matters are periodically examined by tax authorities and governmental bodies, including the IRS, which may disagree with H&R Block, Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K15Table of Contentspositions taken by us in determining our tax liability. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes.On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation), which made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that impacted our financial statements. Given the lack of regulatory guidance that clarifies the interpretations of the Tax Legislation, regulatory interpretations that differ from our existing interpretations of the Tax Legislation could materially affect our effective tax rates. In addition, projects undertaken by international organizations may change international tax norms relating to each country’s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade. Given the unpredictability of these and other possible changes to tax laws and related regulations, it is difficult to assess the overall effect of such potential changes, but any such changes could, if adopted and applicable to us, adversely impact our effective tax rates. If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected. RISKS RELATING TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSSand Canyon Corporation, previously known as Option One Mortgage Corporation (including its subsidiaries, collectively, SCC) is subject to potential contingent losses related to representation and warranty claims, which may have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. SCC has in the past accrued, and may in the future accrue, an estimated liability related to these contingent losses, which may not be adequate. SCC exited its mortgage business in fiscal year 2008, but remains exposed to losses relating to mortgage loans it previously originated. Mortgage loans originated by SCC were sold either as whole loans to single third-party buyers or in the form of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs). In connection with the sale of loans or RMBSs, SCC made certain representations and warranties. Claims under these representations and warranties together with any settlement arrangements related to these losses are collectively referred to as ""representation and warranty claims."" The statute of limitations for a contractual claim to enforce a representation and warranty obligation is generally six years or such shorter limitations period that may apply under the law of a state where the economic injury occurred. On June 11, 2015, the New York Court of Appeals, New York's highest court, held in ACE Securities Corp. v. DB Structured Products, Inc. (ACE), that the six-year statute of limitations under New York law starts to run at the time the representations and warranties are made, not the date when the repurchase demand was denied. This decision applies to claims and lawsuits brought against SCC where New York law governs. New York law governs many, though not all, of the transactions into which SCC entered. However, this decision would not affect representation and warranty claims and lawsuits SCC has received or may receive, for example, where the statute of limitations has been tolled by agreement or a suit was timely filed. In response to the statute of limitations rulings in the ACE case and similar rulings in other state and federal courts, parties seeking to pursue representation and warranty claims or lawsuits have sought, and may in the future seek, to distinguish certain aspects of the ACE decision, pursue alternate legal theories of recovery, or assert claims against other contractual parties such as securitization trustees. For example, a 2016 ruling by a New York intermediate appellate court, followed by the federal district court in the second Homeward case described in Item 8, note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, allowed a counterparty to pursue litigation on additional loans in the same trust even though only some of the loans complied with the condition precedent of timely pre-suit notice and opportunity to cure or repurchase. Additionally, plaintiffs in litigation to which SCC is not party have alleged breaches of an independent contractual duty to provide notice of material breaches of representations and warranties and pursued separate claims to which, they argue, the statute of limitations ruling in the ACE case does not apply. The impact on SCC from alternative legal theories seeking to avoid or distinguish the ACE decision, or judicial limitations on the ACE decision, is unclear.162019 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.Table of ContentsSCC has not concluded that a loss related to representation and warranty claims is probable and has not accrued a related liability for these claims as of April 30, 2019. See Item 8, note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding representation and warranty claims. If SCC were required to pay material amounts with respect to contingent losses arising from representation and warranty claims, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, as SCC's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are included in our consolidated financial statements. SCC is subject to litigation and other claims, including potential contingent losses related to securitization transactions in which SCC participated as a depositor or loan originator, which may result in significant financial losses.Although SCC ceased its mortgage loan origination activities in December 2007 and sold its loan servicing business in April 2008, SCC has been, remains, and may in the future be, subject to litigation, claims, including indemnification and contribution claims, and other loss contingencies pertaining to SCC's mortgage business activities that occurred prior to such termination and sale. See Item 8, note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of litigation and other claims to which SCC may be subject. Between January 2005 and November 2007, SCC originated mortgage loans totaling approximately $80 billion. Mortgage loans originated by SCC were sold either as whole loans to single third-party buyers, who generally securitized such loans, or in the form of RMBSs. SCC estimates approximately 90% of the loans it originated in 2005, 2006, and 2007 were securitized in approximately 110 securitization transactions. In most of these securitization transactions, SCC agreed, subject to certain conditions and limitations, to indemnify the underwriters or depositors for certain losses and expenses that the underwriters or depositors may incur as a result of certain claims made against them relating to loans originated by SCC, including certain legal expenses the underwriters or depositors incur in their defense of such claims. Some of those underwriters and depositors are, or have been, defendants in lawsuits where various other parties allege a variety of claims, including violations of U.S. federal and state securities law and common law fraud based on alleged materially inaccurate or misleading disclosures, arising out of the activities of such underwriters or depositors in their sale of RMBSs or mortgage loans. Based on information currently available to SCC, it believes that the 21 lawsuits in which notice of a claim for indemnification has been made involve 39 securitization transactions with original investments of approximately $14 billion (of which the outstanding principal amount is approximately $3.1 billion). Certain of the notices received included, and future notices may include, a reservation of rights to assert claims for contribution, which are referred to herein as ""contribution claims."" Contribution claims may become operative if indemnification is unavailable or insufficient to cover all of the losses and expenses involved. These indemnification and contribution claims are frequently not subject to a contractual term or limit. Additional lawsuits against the underwriters or depositors may be filed in the future, and SCC may receive additional notices of claims for indemnification or contribution from underwriters or depositors with respect to existing or new lawsuits or settlements of such lawsuits. Securitization trustees also are, or have been, involved in lawsuits related to securitization transactions in which SCC participated. Plaintiffs in these lawsuits allege, among other things, that originators, depositors, servicers or other parties breached their representations and warranties or otherwise failed to fulfill their obligations, including that securitization trustees breached their contractual obligations, breached their fiduciary duties, or violated statutory requirements by failing to properly protect the certificate holders’ interests. SCC has received notices from securitization trustees of potential indemnification obligations, and may receive additional notices with respect to existing or new lawsuits or settlements of such lawsuits, in its capacity as originator, depositor, or servicer.In addition, other counterparties to the securitization transactions, including certificate holders and monoline insurance companies, have filed or may file lawsuits, or may assert indemnification or contribution claims, directly against depositors and loan originators in securitization transactions alleging a variety of claims, including U.S. federal and state securities law violations, common law torts and fraud and breach of contract claims, among others. Additional or new lawsuits or claims may be filed or asserted against SCC in the future. We have not concluded that a loss related to these matters is probable, nor have we accrued a liability for these claims as of April 30, 2019. However, if SCC were required to pay material amounts with respect to these matters, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations H&R Block, Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K17Table of Contentsand cash flows, as SCC's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows are included in our consolidated financial statements. See Item 8, note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.H&R Block has guaranteed the payment of certain limited claims against SCC.SCC is subject to representation and warranty claims by counterparties to SCC whole loan sales and securitization transactions, including certificate holders, securitization trustees, monoline insurance companies, and subsequent purchasers of whole loans. In certain limited circumstances described below, H&R Block guaranteed payment if claims are successfully asserted by such counterparties.These guarantees include representation and warranty claims with respect to a limited number of whole loan sales by SCC with an aggregate outstanding principal and liquidated amount of approximately $1.0 billion as of April 30, 2019, based on the data available to SCC. There have been a total of approximately $41 million of representation and warranty claims with respect to these whole loan sales.These guarantees also cover limited representation and warranty claims on other outstanding securitization transactions, with a potential claims exposure of less than $200 million. In addition, as is customary in divestiture transactions, H&R Block guaranteed the payment of any indemnification claims from the purchaser of SCC's servicing business, including claims relating to pre-closing services (closing occurred in 2008).We could be subject to claims by the creditors of SCC.As discussed above, SCC is subject to representation and warranty claims, indemnification and contribution claims, and other claims and litigation related to its past sales and securitizations of mortgage loans. Additional claims and litigation may be asserted in the future. If the amount that SCC is ultimately required to pay with respect to these claims and litigation, together with related administration and legal expense, exceeds its net assets, the creditors of SCC, or a bankruptcy trustee if SCC were to file or be forced into bankruptcy, may attempt to assert claims against us for payment of SCC's obligations. Claimants have also attempted, and may in the future attempt, to assert claims or seek payment directly from the Company even if SCC's assets exceed its liabilities. SCC's principal assets, as of April 30, 2019, total approximately $289 million and consist of an intercompany note receivable. We believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate veil-piercing arguments; however, if this position is challenged and not upheld, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, in certain limited instances, H&R Block guaranteed amounts as outlined in the above risk factor"
1,HRB,BLOCK H & R INC,2018-06-15,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business activities expose us to a variety of risks. Identification, monitoring, and management of these risks are essential to the success of our operations and the financial soundness of H&R Block. Senior management and the Board of Directors, acting as a whole and through its committees, take an active role in our risk management process and have delegated certain activities related to the oversight of risk management to the Company's Enterprise Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior managers of major businesses and control functions. The Risk Committee is responsible for identifying and monitoring risk exposures and leading the continued development of our risk management policies and practices. An investment in our securities involves risk, including the risk that the value of that investment may decline or that returns on that investment may fall below expectations. There are a number of significant factors that could cause actual conditions, events, or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, many of which are beyond management's control or its ability to accurately estimate or predict, or that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and the value of an investment in our securities.RISKS RELATING TO CONTINUING OPERATIONSThe individual income tax changes contained in the Tax Legislation may have a negative impact on the demand for and pricing of our services, which could adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted Tax Legislation, which among other things, makes significant changes to the individual income tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code generally effective beginning in calendar year 2018, including a reduction of individual federal tax rate brackets at most income levels, the elimination of personal exemptions, an increase in the standard deduction, and placing a cap on the aggregate amount of property, sales, and state and local income tax deductions at $10,000. The Tax Legislation is likely to increase the number of individual taxpayers that choose to utilize the standard deduction beginning in tax season 2019, which could decrease the demand or the amount we charge for our services, and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.There are various other initiatives from time to time seeking to modify the Internal Revenue Code or otherwise simplify tax return preparation. In addition, taxing authorities in various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have also introduced measures seeking to simplify or otherwise modify the preparation and filing of tax returns in their respective jurisdictions. The adoption or expansion of any measures that significantly simplify tax return preparation, expedite refunds, or otherwise reduce the need for third-party tax return preparation services could reduce demand for our services and products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Increased competition for tax preparation clients could adversely affect our current market share and profitability. Offers of free tax preparation services could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.We provide both assisted and DIY tax preparation services and products and face substantial competition throughout our businesses. All categories in the tax return preparation industry are highly competitive and additional competitors have entered, and in the future may enter, the market to provide tax preparation services or products. In the assisted tax services category, there are a substantial number of tax return preparation firms and accounting firms offering tax return preparation services. Commercial tax return preparers are highly competitive with regard to price and service. In the DIY category, options include various forms of digital electronic assistance, including online and mobile applications, and desktop software, all of which we offer. Our DIY services and products compete with a number of online and software companies, primarily on price and functionality. Individual tax filers may elect to change their tax preparation method, choosing from among various assisted and DIY offerings, and technology increasingly makes switching among tax preparers and tax preparation methods easier for those consumers. Technology advances quickly and in new and unexpected ways, and it is difficult to predict the manner in which these changes will impact the tax return preparation industry, the problems we may encounter in enhancing our services and products or the time and resources we may need to devote to the creation, support, and maintenance of technological enhancements. If we are slow to enhance our services, products, or technologies, if our competitors are able to achieve results more quickly H&R Block, Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K7Table of Contentsthan us, or if there are new and unexpected entrants into the industry, we may fail to capture, or lose, a significant share of the market. Additionally, we and many other tax return preparation firms are involved in providing one or more of RTs, prepaid cards, RAs, other financial services and products, and other tax-related services and products, many of which are subject to regulatory scrutiny, litigation, and other risks. We can make no assurances that we will be able to offer, or continue to offer, all of these services and products and a failure to do so could negatively impact our financial results and ability to compete. Intense competition could result in a reduction of our market share, lower revenues, lower margins, and lower profitability. U.S. federal, state and foreign governmental authorities in certain jurisdictions in which we operate currently offer, or facilitate the offering of, tax return preparation and electronic filing options to taxpayers at no charge, and certain volunteer organizations also prepare tax returns at no charge for low-income taxpayers. In addition, many of our competitors offer certain tax preparation services and products at no charge. In order to compete, we have offered certain, and may in the future offer additional, tax preparation services and related products at no charge. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract clients or effectively ensure the migration of clients from our free tax service offerings to those for which we receive fees, and clients who have formerly paid for our tax service offerings may elect to use free offerings instead. These competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability, or harm our ability to acquire and retain clients.Government tax authorities, volunteer organizations, and our competitors may also elect to implement or expand free offerings in the future. Free File, Inc., which exists under an agreement that expires in October 2020, is currently the sole means by which the IRS offers DIY tax software to taxpayers. If the Free File program is terminated and the IRS itself provides tax preparation services, the federal government would become our direct competitor, which could potentially have material adverse revenue implications.In addition, from time to time, U.S. federal and state governments have considered various proposals through which the respective governmental taxing authorities would use taxpayer information provided by employers, financial institutions, and other payers to ""pre-populate,"" prepare and calculate tax returns and distribute them to taxpayers. Under this approach, the taxpayer could then review and contest the return or sign and return it, reducing the need for third-party tax return preparation services and the demand for our services and products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. There are various initiatives from time to time seeking to expedite refunds, which could reduce the demand for RTs. In addition, the IRS has in the past explored the possibility of allowing taxpayers to allocate a portion of their tax refunds to pay tax preparation fees, but the IRS has not advanced this initiative. We believe that governmental encroachment at both the U.S. federal and state levels, as well as comparable government levels in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, could present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future.Failure to comply with laws and regulations that protect our clients' and employees' personal information could harm our brand and reputation and could result in significant fines, penalties, and damages.In the course of our business, we collect, use, and retain large amounts of personal information and data from our clients, including tax return information, financial product and service information, and social security numbers. In addition, we collect, use and retain personal information and data of our employees in the ordinary course of our business. We use security and business controls to limit access to and use of personal information, but unauthorized individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent these security and business measures, which could cause us to determine that it is required or advisable for us to notify affected clients, employees, or regulators under applicable privacy laws and regulations. In the normal course of their duties, some full-time and temporary employees, as well as some contractors and third-party vendors, may have access to or execute transactions requiring the personal information of clients and employees. While we conduct employee background checks, as allowed by law, and limit access to systems and data, it is possible that one or more of these controls could fail or be circumvented. In addition, though we impose certain requirements and controls on our third-party vendors, it is possible that our third-party vendors may not appropriately employ the controls that we require of them or that such controls may be insufficient to protect personal information. Improper disclosure or use of our clients' or employees' information could require remedial actions or disclosures which could be costly; furthermore, the resulting damage to our brand and reputation could be significant and long-lasting. Additionally, we may be subject to claims and litigation by clients, employees, or governmental agencies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.82018 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.Table of ContentsWe are subject to laws, rules, and regulations relating to the collection, use, disclosure, and security of consumer and employee personal information, which have drawn increased attention from U.S. federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate. In the U.S., the IRS generally requires a tax return preparer to obtain the prior written consent of the taxpayer to use or disclose the taxpayer's information for certain purposes other than tax return preparation, which may limit our ability to market revenue-generating products to our clients. In addition, other regulations require financial institutions to adopt and disclose their consumer privacy notice and generally provide consumers with a reasonable opportunity to ""opt-out"" of having nonpublic personal information disclosed to unaffiliated third parties. Numerous jurisdictions have passed, and may in the future pass, new laws related to the use and retention of consumer information and this area continues to be an area of interest for U.S. federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities. These laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and our current data protection policies and practices may not be consistent with all of those interpretations and applications. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state regulatory requirements, as well as requirements imposed by governmental authorities in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, could result in more stringent requirements and in a need to change business practices, including the types of information we can use and the manner in which we can use such information. Establishing systems and processes to achieve compliance with these new requirements may increase our costs or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities.A security breach of our systems, or third-party systems on which we rely, resulting in unauthorized access to personal client information or other sensitive, nonpublic information, may adversely affect the demand for our services and products, our reputation, and financial performance.We offer a range of services and products to our clients, including assisted and DIY tax return preparation solutions, and financial products and services. Due to the nature of these services and products, we use multiple digital technologies to collect, transmit, and store high volumes of personal client information. We also host, collect, use, and retain other sensitive, nonpublic information, such as employee social security numbers, healthcare information, and payroll information, as well as confidential, nonpublic business information. Certain third parties and vendors have access to personal client information to help deliver customer benefits and products, or may host certain of our and our customers’ sensitive and personal information and data. Information security risks to companies that use digital technologies continue to increase due in part to the increased adoption of and reliance upon these technologies by companies and consumers. Our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened due to a variety of factors including, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats and related regulation, the increased sophistication of organized crime, cyber criminals, and hackers, the prominence of our brand, our and our franchisees' extensive office footprint, our plans to continue to implement strategies for our online and mobile applications and our desktop software, and our use of third-party vendors. Cybersecurity risks may result from fraud or malice (a cyber attack), human error, or accidental technological failure. Cyber attacks are designed to electronically circumvent network security for malicious purposes such as unlawfully obtaining personal client information, disrupting our ability to offer services, damaging our brand and reputation, stealing our intellectual property, and advancing social or political agendas. We face a variety of cyber attack threats including computer viruses, malicious codes, worms, phishing attacks, social engineering, denial of service attacks, ransomware, and other sophisticated attacks. Although we expend significant resources to maintain multiple levels of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate the risk of a security breach, such measures cannot provide absolute security. We regularly test our systems to discover and address potential vulnerabilities, and we rely on training and testing of our employees regarding heightened phishing and social engineering threats. Due to the structure of our business model, we also rely on our franchisees and other private and governmental third parties to maintain secure systems and respond to cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes, and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access remain a high priority for us. As risks and regulations continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Notwithstanding these efforts, there can be no assurance that a security breach, intrusion, or loss or theft of personal client information will not occur. In addition, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently, become more sophisticated, and are often undetectable until after a successful attack, causing us to be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. Although we generally seek to maintain insurance from time to time that might mitigate some of our H&R Block, Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K9Table of Contentsdamages in the event of a significant security breach or cyberattack, we would still be exposed to damages in the amounts of our deductibles, retentions, and for losses outside of the scope of our policies (e.g., reputational harm). Furthermore, insurance against cybersecurity risks may cease to be available to us in the future or the pricing of such insurance may be prohibitively costly.A breach of our security measures or those of our franchisees or third parties on whom we rely, or other fraudulent activity, could result in unauthorized access to personal client information or other sensitive, nonpublic information. If such an event were to occur, it could have serious short and long term negative consequences. Security breach remediation could require us to expend significant resources to notify or assist impacted individuals, repair damaged systems, implement modified information security measures, and maintain client and business relationships. Other consequences could include reduced client demand for our services and products, loss of valuable intellectual property, reduced growth and profitability and negative impacts to future financial results, loss of our ability to deliver one or more services or products (e.g., inability to provide financial products and services or to accept and process client credit card orders or tax returns), litigation, harm to our reputation and brands, fines, penalties, and other damages, and further regulation and oversight by U.S. federal, state, or foreign governmental authorities. A security breach or other unauthorized access to our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Stolen identity refund fraud and other fraud could impede our clients' ability to timely and successfully file their tax returns and receive their tax refunds, and could diminish consumers' perceptions of the security and reliability of our products and services, resulting in negative publicity. Increased governmental regulation to attempt to combat fraud could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.Companies offering tax preparation services (especially those offering DIY solutions) are at risk of criminals utilizing stolen information obtained through hacking, phishing, and other means of identity theft in order to electronically file fraudulent federal and state tax returns. As a result, impacted taxpayers must complete additional forms and go through additional steps in order to report to appropriate authorities that their identities have been stolen and their tax returns were filed fraudulently. Though we offer assistance in the refund recovery process and offer our TIS product to help protect clients, stolen identity refund fraud could impede our clients' ability to timely and successfully file their returns and receive their tax refunds, and could diminish consumers' perceptions of the security and reliability of our products and services, resulting in negative publicity, despite there having been no breach in the security of our systems. In addition, if stolen identity refund fraud is perpetrated at a material level through our products or services, state, federal, or foreign tax authorities may refuse to allow us to continue to process our clients' tax returns electronically. As a result, stolen identity refund fraud could harm our revenue, results of operations, and reputation.Federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate have taken action, and may in the future take additional action, in an attempt to combat stolen identity refund fraud, which may require changes to our systems and business practices, that we cannot anticipate. These actions may have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Our clients may access our services and products from personal or public computers and mobile devices and may install and use our DIY desktop software on their computers. Those computers and other devices may have outdated systems, may run software that is no longer supported, or may not have security patches installed on a timely basis. Due to these and other factors, a person with malicious intent could obtain user account and password information from our clients through hacking, phishing, or other means of cyber attack, in order to perpetrate stolen identity refund fraud and other crimes against our clients. It has been reported that a number of companies, including some in the tax return preparation industry, have experienced instances where criminals gained unauthorized and illegal access to their systems by using stolen identity information (e.g., user account and password information) from sources other than those companies. The unauthorized and illegal access to those systems was used by criminals to perpetrate a variety of crimes, including stolen identity refund fraud. We could experience this form of unauthorized and illegal access to our systems, despite there having been no breach in the security of our systems, which could negatively impact our clients and harm our revenue, results of operations, and reputation. Additionally, if such unauthorized or illegal access occurs, we may be subject to claims and litigation by clients, non-clients, or governmental agencies. 102018 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.Table of ContentsAn interruption in our information systems, or those of our franchisees or a third party on which we rely, or an interruption in the internet, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. We, our franchisees, and other third parties involved in our business operations rely heavily upon communications, networks, and information systems and the internet to conduct our business. These networks, systems, and operations are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from upgrades and maintenance, network failure, hardware failure, software failure, power or telecommunications failures, cyber attacks involving the penetration of our network by hackers or other unauthorized users (e.g., through computer viruses and worms, malicious code, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, information security breaches, or other negative disruptions to the operation of the internet), human error, and natural disasters. As our businesses are seasonal, our systems must be capable of processing high volumes during our peak periods. Therefore, any failure or interruption in our information systems, or information systems of our franchisees or a private or government third party on which we rely, or an interruption in the internet or other critical business capability, could negatively impact our business operations and reputation, and increase our risk of loss. There can be no assurance that system or internet failures, or interruptions in critical business capabilities will not occur, or, if they do occur, that we, our franchisees or the private or governmental third parties on whom we rely, will adequately address them. The precautionary measures that we have implemented to avoid systems outages and to minimize the effects of any data or communication systems interruptions or failures may not be adequate in all circumstances, and we may not have anticipated or addressed all of the potential events that could threaten or undermine our information systems or other critical business capabilities. The occurrence of any systems or internet failure, or business interruption could negatively impact our ability to serve our clients, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.We may not be effective in achieving our strategic and operating objectives, and our efforts may increase costs without achieving expected future benefits, or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.We are conducting an ongoing comprehensive strategy review. Implementing the strategic and operating objectives resulting from such review will require investments of capital and human resources. Although these activities are expected to improve our future long term trajectory, they are also expected to have a negative impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in the short term.While we believe that our strategic and operating objectives reflect opportunities that are appropriate and achievable, there is a possibility that our objectives may not deliver projected long-term growth in revenue and profitability due to inadequate execution, incorrect assumptions, global or local economic conditions, competition, changes in the tax return preparation industry, sub-optimal resource allocation, or other reasons, including any of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section. In pursuit of our strategic and operating objectives, we may also invest significant time and resources into new initiatives, and these offerings could fail to yield sufficient return to cover our investment. If we are unable to realize the expected benefits from our new strategic framework, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB to administer and, in some cases, enforce U.S. federal financial consumer protection laws and expanded the role of state regulators with respect to consumer protection laws. Regulations promulgated by the CFPB or other regulators may affect our financial services businesses in ways we cannot predict, which may require changes to our financial products, services, and contracts.The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB and gave it broad powers to administer, investigate compliance with, and, in some cases, enforce U.S. federal financial consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of financial consumer protection laws that apply to banks and other financial services companies, including the authority to prohibit ""unfair, deceptive, or abusive"" acts and practices. The CFPB may examine, investigate, and take enforcement actions against our subsidiaries that provide consumer financial services and products, as well as financial institutions and service providers upon which our subsidiaries rely H&R Block, Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K11Table of Contentsto provide consumer financial services and products. The Dodd-Frank Act also expanded the role of state regulators in enforcing and promulgating financial consumer protection laws, the results of which could be (i) states issuing new and broader financial consumer protection laws, some of which could be more comprehensive than existing U.S. federal regulations, or (ii) state attorneys general bringing actions to enforce federal consumer protection laws in the absence of CFPB action. Currently proposed or new CFPB and state regulations may require changes to our financial products, services and contracts, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Examples of recent CFPB action include the following:▪On November 17, 2017, the CFPB officially published its final rule changing the regulation of certain consumer credit products, including payday loans, vehicle title loans, and high-cost installment loans (the ""Payday Rule""). Certain limited provisions of the Payday Rule became effective on January 16, 2018, but most provisions do not become effective until August 19, 2019. However, on January 16, 2018, the CFPB stated its intention to engage in a rulemaking process so that the CFPB may reconsider the Payday Rule, and industry groups have filed lawsuits challenging the rule. Given these developments, we are unsure whether, and in what form, the Payday Rule will to into effect. Depending on the outcome of the rulemaking process and litigation, which may include the Payday Rule becoming effective in its current form, the Payday Rule may have a material adverse impact on the EA product, our business, and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. We will continue to analyze the potential impact on the Company as the CFPB’s rulemaking process progresses.▪On October 5, 2016, the CFPB released its final rule regulating certain prepaid products (the ""Prepaid Card Rule""). The Prepaid Card Rule was scheduled to take effect on April 1, 2018, with certain provisions phased in over time following that date. However, on January 25, 2018, the CFPB amended the Prepaid Card Rule and extended the general effective date until April 1, 2019. Once effective, the Prepaid Card Rule will apply to the Emerald Card. The Prepaid Card Rule, among other things: (i) requires consumer disclosures to be made prior to acquiring a prepaid account; (ii) requires periodic statements or online access to specified account information; and (iii) requires online posting of the Cardholder Agreement and submission of new and revised Cardholder Agreements to the CFPB. We do not expect that the Prepaid Card Rule will have a material adverse effect on our business or our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The nature of our tax service and product offerings requires timely product launches. Any significant delays in launching our tax service and product offerings, changes in government regulations or processes that affect how we provide such offerings to our clients, or significant problems with such offerings or the manner in which we provide them to our clients may harm our revenue, results of operations, and reputation.Tax laws and tax forms are subject to change each year, and the nature and timing of such changes are unpredictable. As a part of our business, we must incorporate any changes to tax laws and tax forms into our tax service and product offerings, including our online and mobile applications and desktop software. The unpredictable nature, timing and effective dates of changes to tax laws and tax forms can result in condensed development cycles for our tax service and product offerings because our clients expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of such offerings to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline and, in turn, receive any tax refund amounts on a timely basis. In addition, governmental authorities regularly change their processes for accepting tax filings and related tax forms. Further, changes in governmental administrations or regulations could result in a delay of the start of the tax season or in further and unanticipated changes in requirements or processes. Changes in governmental regulations and processes that affect how we provide services and products to our clients may require us to make corresponding changes to our client service systems and procedures. Furthermore, unanticipated changes in governmental processes for accepting tax filings and related forms, or the ability of taxing authorities to accept electronic tax return filings, may result in delays in our processing of our clients' tax filings, or delays in tax authorities accepting electronic tax return filings, and, in turn, delay any tax refund amounts to which such clients may be entitled. From time to time, we review and enhance our quality controls for preparing accurate tax returns, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent all inaccuracies. Any significant delays in launching our tax service and product offerings, changes in government regulations or processes that affect how we provide such offerings to our clients, or significant 122018 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.Table of Contentsproblems with such offerings or the manner in which we provide them to our clients may harm our revenue, results of operations, and reputation.If we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our systems, services or products, we may elect to delay or suspend our offerings. Any major defects or launch delays, or unanticipated changes in governmental processes for accepting tax filings and related forms, may lead to loss of clients and revenue, negative publicity, client and employee dissatisfaction, a deterioration in our business relationships with our franchisees, reduced retailer shelf space and promotions, exposure to litigation, and increased operating expenses. Any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Regulatory actions could have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The Company is subject to additional federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, in the areas of franchise, labor, immigration, advertising, consumer protection, financial services and products, payment processing, privacy, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety, insurance, and healthcare. There have been significant new regulations and heightened focus by the government in some of these areas, including, for example, healthcare, consumer financial services and products, and labor, including overtime and exemption regulations and state and local laws on minimum wage and other labor-related issues. There may be additional regulatory actions or enforcement priorities, or new interpretations of existing requirements that differ from ours. These developments could impose unanticipated limitations or require changes to our business, which may make elements of our business more expensive, less efficient, or impossible to conduct, and may require us to modify our current or future services or products, which effects may be heightened given the nature, broad geographic scope, and seasonality of our business.We rely on a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key services or products, and the inability of these key vendors to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Historically, we have contracted, and in the future we will likely continue to contract, with a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key services or products for our tax, financial, and other services and products. Two examples of this type of reliance are our relationships with Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (FIS), for data processing and card production services, and BofI, for the issuance of RTs, EAs, RAs and Emerald Cards. In certain instances, we are vulnerable to vendor error, service inefficiencies, service interruptions, or service delays. Our sensitivity to any of these issues may be heightened (1) due to the seasonality of our business, (2) with respect to any vendor that we utilize for the provision of any product or service that has specialized expertise, (3) with respect to any vendor that is a sole or exclusive provider, or (4) with respect to any vendor whose indemnification obligations are limited or that does not have the financial capacity to satisfy its indemnification obligations. Some of our vendors are subject to the oversight of regulatory bodies and, as a result, our product or service offerings may be affected by the actions or decisions of such regulatory bodies. Vendor failures could occur in various ways including (1) vendor error, (2) inability to meet our needs in a timely manner, or (3) termination or delay in the services or products provided by a vendor because the vendor fails to perform adequately, is no longer in business, experiences shortages, or discontinues a certain product or service that we utilize. If our vendors are unable to meet our needs and we are not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and cost-effectively, it could result in a material and adverse impact on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The specialized and highly seasonal nature of our business presents financial risks and operational challenges, which, if not satisfactorily addressed, could materially affect our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Our business is highly seasonal, with the substantial portion of our revenue earned in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Success in our industry depends on our ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain key personnel in a timely manner, including members of our executive team and those in seasonal tax preparation positions or with other required specialized expertise, including technical positions. The market for such personnel is extremely competitive, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain the required personnel H&R Block, Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K13Table of Contentswithin necessary timeframes. If we are unable to attract, develop, motivate, and retain key personnel, our business, operations, and financial results could be negatively impacted. In addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations are adopted or implemented that increase our labor costs, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The concentration of our revenue-generating activity during this relatively short period presents a number of additional challenges for us, including (1) cash and resource management during the first nine months of our fiscal year, when we generally operate at a loss and incur fixed costs and costs of preparing for the upcoming tax season, (2) ensuring compliance with financial covenants under our Second Amended and Restated Credit and Guarantee Agreement (2017 CLOC), particularly if the timing of our revenue generation deviates from this seasonal period, (3) responding to changes in competitive conditions, including marketing, pricing, and new product offerings, which could affect our position during the tax season, (4) disruptions in a tax season, including any customer dissatisfaction issues or negative social media campaigns, which may not be timely discovered or satisfactorily addressed, and (5) ensuring optimal uninterrupted operations and service delivery during the tax season. If we experience significant business disruptions during the tax season or if we are unable to satisfactorily address the challenges described above and related challenges associated with a seasonal business, we could experience a loss of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.We face litigation in connection with our various business activities, and current or future litigation may damage our reputation, impair our product offerings, or result in material liabilities and losses.We have been named, and from time to time will likely continue to be named, in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class or representative actions, actions or inquiries by state attorneys general, and other litigation arising in connection with our various business activities, including relating to our various service and product offerings. We also grant our franchisees a limited license to use our registered trademarks and, accordingly, there is risk that one or more of the franchisees may be alleged to be controlled by us. Third parties, regulators or courts may seek to hold us responsible for the actions or failures to act by our franchisees. Adverse outcomes related to litigation could result in substantial damages and could cause our earnings to decline. Negative public opinion could also result from our subsidiaries' or franchisees' actual or alleged conduct in such claims, possibly damaging our reputation, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business prospects and cause the market price of our securities to decline.In addition, we have been sued, and certain of our competitors have been sued, in connection with the offering of different types of RT products. Further, we have received an inquiry from the California Attorney General requesting information regarding our RT product. In a case involving one of our competitors, a California appellate court affirmed a trial court's ruling that the competitor's specific version of a RT product was subject to truth-in-lending and other related laws. Following the appellate court's ruling, the case was denied further appellate review. We believe there are differences that distinguish our RT product from the product that was the subject of the competitor's case described above. Revenues from our RT product totaled $172 million in fiscal year 2018; any requirement that materially alters our offering of RTs, including limitations on the fees we charge or disclosure requirements that could reduce the demand for these products, could have a material adverse impact on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Our access to liquidity may be negatively impacted as disruptions in credit markets occur, if our credit ratings are downgraded, or if we fail to meet certain covenants. Our funding costs may increase, leading to reduced earnings.We need liquidity to meet our off-season working capital requirements, to service debt obligations including refinancing of maturing obligations, and for general corporate purposes. Our access to and the cost of liquidity could be negatively impacted in the event of credit rating downgrades or if we fail to meet existing financial covenants. In addition, events could occur which could increase our need for liquidity above current levels.If rating agencies downgrade our credit rating, the cost of debt under our existing financing arrangements, as well as future financing arrangements, could increase and capital market access could decrease or become unavailable. Our 2017 CLOC is subject to various covenants, and a violation of a covenant could impair our access to liquidity currently available through the 2017 CLOC. The 2017 CLOC includes provisions that allow for the issuance of equity to comply with the financial covenant calculations as a means to avoid a shortfall. If current sources of liquidity were to become unavailable, we would need to obtain additional sources of funding, which may not be available or may 142018 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.Table of Contentsonly be available under less favorable terms. This could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The continued payment of dividends on our common stock and repurchases of our common stock are dependent on a number of factors, and future payments and repurchases cannot be assured.We need liquidity sufficient to fund payments of dividends on our common stock and repurchases of our common stock. In addition, holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments, and our Board of Directors may only authorize the Company to repurchase shares of our common stock with funds legally available for such repurchases. The payment of future dividends and future repurchases will depend upon our earnings, economic conditions, liquidity and capital requirements, and other factors, including our debt leverage. Even if we have sufficient resources to pay dividends and to repurchase shares of our common stock, the Board of Directors may determine to use such resources to fund other Company initiatives. Accordingly, we cannot make any assurance that future dividends will be paid, or future repurchases will be made, at levels comparable to our historical practices, if at all. In addition, payments of dividends negatively impact net worth. Due to the seasonal nature of our business and the fact that our business is not asset-intensive, we have had, and are likely to continue to have, a negative net worth under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) at various times throughout the year, and thus the payment of dividends or stock repurchases causes us to further increase that GAAP negative net worth.Our businesses may be adversely affected by difficult economic conditions, in particular, high unemployment levels.Difficult economic conditions are frequently characterized by high unemployment levels and declining consumer and business spending. These poor economic conditions may negatively affect demand and pricing for our services and products. In the event of difficult economic conditions that include high unemployment levels, especially within the client segments we serve, clients may elect not to file tax returns or utilize lower cost preparation and filing alternatives. Sustained levels of high unemployment may negatively impact our ability to increase or retain tax preparation clients.Our business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands.Developing and maintaining awareness of our brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and products and is an important element in attracting new clients. In addition, our franchisees may operate their businesses under our brands. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to events or activities involving or attributed to us, our franchisees, employees, or agents or our services or products, which may be enhanced due to the nature of social media, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our services and products and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands.Failure to protect our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third party allegations of infringement may be costly. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information, we may be unable to do so effectively in all cases. Our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyber attack or other wrongful conduct by employees or third parties. To the extent that our intellectual property is not protected effectively by trademarks, copyrights, patents, or other means, other parties with knowledge of our intellectual property, including former employees, may seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own or others' advantage. Competitors may also misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights or duplicate our technology and products. Any significant impairment or misappropriation of our intellectual property or proprietary information could harm our business and our brand, and may adversely affect our ability to compete. In addition, third parties may allege we are infringing their intellectual property rights, and we may face intellectual property challenges from other parties. We may not be successful in defending against any such challenges or in obtaining licenses to avoid or resolve any intellectual property disputes and, in that event, we could lose significant revenues, incur significant royalty or technology development expenses, suffer harm to our reputation, or pay significant monetary damages.H&R Block, Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K15Table of ContentsFailure to maintain sound business relationships with our franchisees may have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Our financial success depends in significant part on our ability to maintain sound business relationships with our franchisees. The support of our franchisees is also critical for the success of our marketing programs and any new strategic initiatives we seek to undertake. Deterioration in our relationships with our franchisees or the failure of our franchisees to support our marketing programs and strategic initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Our international operations are subject to risks which may harm our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.We have international operations, including in Canada and Australia, and may consider expansion opportunities in additional countries in the future. There is uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from new or emerging foreign operations and expand into other international markets. Additionally, there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including: (1) changes in trade regulations; (2) difficulties in managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences; (3) profit repatriation restrictions, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; (4) geopolitical events, including acts of war and terrorism, and economic and political instability; (5) compliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable foreign anti-corruption laws; (6) compliance with U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those concerning privacy, and data protection and retention; and (7) risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws. These risks inherent in our international operations and expansion could increase our costs of doing business internationally and could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.In addition, we prepare U.S. federal and state tax returns for taxpayers residing in foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union (EU), and we operate and have franchisees who operate in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, certain aspects of our operations are subject, or may in the future become subject, to the laws, regulations, and policies of those jurisdictions that regulate the collection, use, and transfer of personal data, which may be more stringent than those of the U.S. For example, the European Commission approved a data protection regulation, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018. Costs for us to comply with such laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to us could be significant.  We may also face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to these laws, regulations, and policies that could result in the imposition of penalties or fines.We may be adversely impacted by changes in corporate tax rates, the adoption of new tax legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and exposure to additional tax liabilities. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions where our subsidiaries are organized and conduct their operations. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries are organized and conduct their operations may change significantly as a result of political or economic factors beyond our control. Additionally, our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Our tax returns and other tax matters are periodically examined by tax authorities and governmental bodies, including the IRS, which may disagree with positions taken by us in determining our tax liability. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. As described above, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted Tax Legislation, which makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that impacted our financial statements, the most significant being a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and the imposition of a one-time transition tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries. We are in the process of finalizing our assessment of the impact of Tax Legislation and our provisional estimates may change as a result of additional analysis of the underlying calculations or by additional regulatory guidance that clarifies the interpretations of Tax Legislation. See Item 8, note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the impact of Tax Legislation.162018 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.Table of ContentsIn addition, projects undertaken by international organizations may change international tax norms relating to each country’s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade. Given the unpredictability of these and other possible changes to tax laws and related regulations, it is difficult to assess the overall effect of such potential changes, but any such changes could, if adopted and applicable to us, adversely impact our effective tax rates. If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected. RISKS RELATING TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSSand Canyon Corporation, previously known as Option One Mortgage Corporation (including its subsidiaries, collectively, SCC) is subject to potential contingent losses related to representation and warranty claims, which may have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. SCC has in the past accrued, and may in the future accrue, an estimated liability related to these contingent losses, which may not be adequate. SCC exited its mortgage business in fiscal year 2008, but remains exposed to losses relating to mortgage loans it previously originated. Mortgage loans originated by SCC were sold either as whole loans to single third-party buyers or in the form of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs). In connection with the sale of loans or RMBSs, SCC made certain representations and warranties. Claims under these representations and warranties together with any settlement arrangements related to these losses are collectively referred to as ""representation and warranty claims."" The statute of limitations for a contractual claim to enforce a representation and warranty obligation is generally six years or such shorter limitations period that may apply under the law of a state where the economic injury occurred. On June 11, 2015, the New York Court of Appeals, New York's highest court, held in ACE Securities Corp. v. DB Structured Products, Inc. (ACE), that the six-year statute of limitations under New York law starts to run at the time the representations and warranties are made, not the date when the repurchase demand was denied. This decision applies to claims and lawsuits brought against SCC where New York law governs. New York law governs many, though not all, of the transactions into which SCC entered. However, this decision would not affect representation and warranty claims and lawsuits SCC has received or may receive, for example, where the statute of limitations has been tolled by agreement or a suit was timely filed. In response to the statute of limitations rulings in the ACE case and similar rulings in other state and federal courts, parties seeking to pursue representation and warranty claims or lawsuits have sought, and may in the future seek, to distinguish certain aspects of the ACE decision, pursue alternate legal theories of recovery, or assert claims against other contractual parties such as securitization trustees. For example, a 2016 ruling by a New York intermediate appellate court, followed by the federal district court in the second Homeward case described in Item 8, note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, allowed a counterparty to pursue litigation on additional loans in the same trust even though only some of the loans complied with the condition precedent of timely pre-suit notice and opportunity to cure or repurchase. Additionally, plaintiffs in litigation to which SCC is not party have alleged breaches of an independent contractual duty to provide notice of material breaches of representations and warranties and pursued separate claims to which, they argue, the statute of limitations ruling in the ACE case does not apply. The impact on SCC from alternative legal theories seeking to avoid or distinguish the ACE decision, or judicial limitations on the ACE decision, is unclear.SCC has not concluded that a loss related to representation and warranty claims is probable and has not accrued a related liability for these claims as of April 30, 2018. See Item 8, note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of settlement payments made during the past three fiscal years related to these claims and additional information regarding representation and warranty claims. If SCC were required to pay material amounts with respect to contingent losses arising from representation and warranty claims, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, as SCC's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are included in our consolidated financial statements. H&R Block, Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K17Table of ContentsSCC is subject to litigation and other claims, including potential contingent losses related to securitization transactions in which SCC participated as a depositor or loan originator, which may result in significant financial losses.Although SCC ceased its mortgage loan origination activities in December 2007 and sold its loan servicing business in April 2008, SCC has been, remains, and may in the future be, subject to litigation, claims, including indemnification and contribution claims, and other loss contingencies pertaining to SCC's mortgage business activities that occurred prior to such termination and sale. See Item 8, note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of litigation and other claims to which SCC may be subject. Between January 2005 and November 2007, SCC originated mortgage loans totaling approximately $80 billion. Mortgage loans originated by SCC were sold either as whole loans to single third-party buyers, who generally securitized such loans, or in the form of RMBSs. SCC estimates approximately 90% of the loans it originated in 2005, 2006, and 2007 were securitized in approximately 110 securitization transactions. In most of these securitization transactions, SCC agreed, subject to certain conditions and limitations, to indemnify the underwriters or depositors for certain losses and expenses that the underwriters or depositors may incur as a result of certain claims made against them relating to loans originated by SCC, including certain legal expenses the underwriters or depositors incur in their defense of such claims. Some of those underwriters and depositors are, or have been, defendants in lawsuits where various other parties allege a variety of claims, including violations of U.S. federal and state securities law and common law fraud based on alleged materially inaccurate or misleading disclosures, arising out of the activities of such underwriters or depositors in their sale of RMBSs or mortgage loans. Based on information currently available to SCC, it believes that the 21 lawsuits in which notice of a claim for indemnification has been made involve 39 securitization transactions with original investments of approximately $14 billion (of which the outstanding principal amount is approximately $3.4 billion). Certain of the notices received included, and future notices may include, a reservation of rights to assert claims for contribution, which are referred to herein as ""contribution claims."" Contribution claims may become operative if indemnification is unavailable or insufficient to cover all of the losses and expenses involved. These indemnification and contribution claims are frequently not subject to a contractual term or limit. Additional lawsuits against the underwriters or depositors may be filed in the future, and SCC may receive additional notices of claims for indemnification or contribution from underwriters or depositors with respect to existing or new lawsuits or settlements of such lawsuits. Securitization trustees also are, or have been, involved in lawsuits related to securitization transactions in which SCC participated. Plaintiffs in these lawsuits allege, among other things, that originators, depositors, servicers or other parties breached their representations and warranties or otherwise failed to fulfill their obligations, including that securitization trustees breached their contractual obligations, breached their fiduciary duties, or violated statutory requirements by failing to properly protect the certificate holders’ interests. SCC has received notices from securitization trustees of potential indemnification obligations, and may receive additional notices with respect to existing or new lawsuits or settlements of such lawsuits, in its capacity as originator, depositor, or servicer.In addition, other counterparties to the securitization transactions, including certificate holders and monoline insurance companies, have filed or may file lawsuits, or may assert indemnification or contribution claims, directly against depositors and loan originators in securitization transactions alleging a variety of claims, including U.S. federal and state securities law violations, common law torts and fraud and breach of contract claims, among others. Additional or new lawsuits or claims may be filed or asserted against SCC in the future. We have not concluded that a loss related to these matters is probable, nor have we accrued a liability for these claims as of April 30, 2018. However, if SCC were required to pay material amounts with respect to these matters, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows, as SCC's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows are included in our consolidated financial statements. See Item 8, note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.H&R Block has guaranteed the payment of certain limited claims against SCC.SCC is subject to representation and warranty claims by counterparties to SCC whole loan sales and securitization transactions, including certificate holders, securitization trustees, monoline insurance companies, and subsequent 182018 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.Table of Contentspurchasers of whole loans. In certain limited circumstances described below, H&R Block guaranteed payment if claims are successfully asserted by such counterparties.These guarantees include representation and warranty claims with respect to a limited number of whole loan sales by SCC with an aggregate outstanding principal and liquidated amount of approximately $1.0 billion as of April 30, 2018, based on the data available to SCC. There have been a total of approximately $41 million of representation and warranty claims with respect to these whole loan sales.These guarantees also cover limited representation and warranty claims on other outstanding securitization transactions, with a potential claims exposure of less than $200 million. In addition, as is customary in divestiture transactions, H&R Block guaranteed the payment of any indemnification claims from the purchaser of SCC's servicing business, including claims relating to pre-closing services (closing occurred in 2008).We could be subject to claims by the creditors of SCC.As discussed above, SCC is subject to representation and warranty claims, indemnification and contribution claims, and other claims and litigation related to its past sales and securitizations of mortgage loans. Additional claims and litigation may be asserted in the future. If the amount that SCC is ultimately required to pay with respect to these claims and litigation, together with related administration and legal expense, exceeds its net assets, the creditors of SCC, or a bankruptcy trustee if SCC were to file or be forced into bankruptcy, may attempt to assert claims against us for payment of SCC's obligations. Claimants have also attempted, and may in the future attempt, to assert claims or seek payment directly from the Company even if SCC's assets exceed its liabilities. SCC's principal assets, as of April 30, 2018, total approximately $300 million and consist of an intercompany note receivable. We believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate veil-piercing arguments; however, if this position is challenged and not upheld, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, in certain limited instances, H&R Block guaranteed amounts as outlined in the above risk factor"
6,HRB,BLOCK H & R INC,2017-06-16,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business activities expose us to a variety of risks. Identification, monitoring and management of these risks are essential to the success of our operations and the financial soundness of H&R Block. Senior management and the Board of Directors, acting as a whole and through its committees, take an active role in our risk management process and have delegated certain activities related to the oversight of risk management to the Company's Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior managers of major businesses and control functions. The Risk Committee is responsible for identifying and monitoring risk exposures and leading the continued development of our risk management policies and practices. An investment in our securities involves risk, including the risk that the value of that investment may decline or that returns on that investment may fall below expectations. There are a number of significant factors that could cause actual conditions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, many of which are beyond management's control or its ability to accurately estimate or predict, or that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and the value of an investment in our securities.RISKS RELATING TO CONTINUING OPERATIONSIncreased competition for tax preparation clients could adversely affect our current market share and profitability. Offers of free tax preparation services could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.We provide both assisted and DIY tax preparation services and products and face substantial competition throughout our businesses. All categories in the tax return preparation industry are highly competitive and additional competitors have entered, and in the future may enter, the market to provide tax preparation products or services. In the assisted tax services category, there are a substantial number of tax return preparation firms and accounting firms offering tax return preparation services. Commercial tax return preparers are highly competitive with regard to price and service. In the DIY category, options include various forms of digital electronic assistance, including online and mobile applications, and desktop software, all of which we offer. Our DIY services and products compete with a number of online and software companies, primarily on price and functionality. Individual tax filers may elect to change their tax preparation method, choosing from among various assisted and DIY offerings. Technology advances quickly and in new and unexpected ways, and it is difficult to predict the manner in which these changes will impact the tax return preparation industry, the problems we may encounter in enhancing our products and services or the time and resources we may need to devote to the creation, support, and maintenance of technological enhancements. If we are slow to enhance our products, services, or technologies, if our competitors are able to achieve results more quickly than us, or if there are new and unexpected entrants into the industry, we may fail to capture, or lose, a significant share of the market. Additionally, we and many other tax return preparation firms are involved in providing one or more of RTs, other financial products and services, and other tax-related services and products, many of which are subject to regulatory scrutiny, litigation, and other risks. We can make no assurances that we will be able to offer, or continue to offer, all of these services and a failure to do so could negatively impact our financial results and ability to compete. Intense competition could result in a reduction of our market share, lower revenues, lower margins and lower profitability. U.S. federal, state and foreign governmental authorities in certain jurisdictions in which we operate currently offer, or facilitate the offering of, tax return preparation and electronic filing options to taxpayers at no charge, and certain volunteer organizations also prepare tax returns at no charge for low-income taxpayers. In addition, many of our competitors offer certain tax preparation services and products at no charge. In order to compete, we have offered certain, and may in the future offer additional, tax preparation services and related products at no charge. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract clients or effectively ensure the migration of clients from our free tax service offerings to those for which we receive fees, and clients who have formerly paid for our tax service offerings may elect to use free offerings instead. These competitive factors may diminish our revenue and profitability, or harm our ability to acquire and retain clients.Government tax authorities, volunteer organizations, and our competitors may also elect to implement or expand free offerings in the future. From time to time, U.S. federal and state governments have considered various proposals (often referred to as ""Return-Free Filing"" or ""Pre-Populated Returns"") through which the respective governmental taxing authorities would use taxpayer information provided by employers, financial institutions, and other payers to ""pre-populate,"" prepare and calculate tax returns and distribute them to taxpayers. Under this approach, the taxpayer H&R Block, Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K7Table of Contentscould then review and contest the return or sign and return it. While the FF and other free options that are currently offered, or may be offered in the future, may reduce the perceived need for government tax service offerings, they foster additional online competition and may cause us to lose significant revenue opportunities. We believe that governmental encroachment at both the U.S. federal and state levels, as well as comparable government levels in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, could present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future.Failure to comply with laws and regulations that protect our clients' and employees' personal information could harm our brand and reputation and could result in significant fines, penalties, and damages.In the course of our business, we collect, use, and retain large amounts of personal client information and data, including tax return information, financial account information, and social security numbers. In addition, we collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business. Our third-party vendors may hold some personal information and third parties may execute transactions utilizing this information. We use security and business controls to limit access to and use of personal information, but unauthorized individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent these security and business measures, which could cause us to determine that it is required or advisable for us to notify affected clients or employees under applicable privacy laws and regulations. In the normal course of their duties, some full-time and temporary employees, as well as some contractors and third-party vendors, may have access to the personal information of clients and employees or execute transactions requiring sensitive information. While we conduct employee background checks, as allowed by law, and limit access to systems and data, it is possible that one or more of these controls could be circumvented. In addition, though we impose certain requirements and controls on our third-party vendors, it is possible that our third-party vendors may not appropriately employ the controls that we require of them. Improper disclosure or use of our clients' or employees' personal information could result in damage to our brand and reputation, and actions required to remediate improper disclosures could be costly. Additionally, we may be subject to claims and litigation by clients, employees, or governmental agencies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.We are subject to laws, rules, and regulations relating to the collection, use, disclosure, and security of consumer and employee personal information, which have drawn increased attention from U.S. federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate. In the U.S., the IRS generally requires a tax return preparer to obtain the prior written consent of the taxpayer to use or disclose the taxpayer's information for certain purposes other than tax return preparation. In addition, other regulations require financial institutions to adopt and disclose their consumer privacy notice and generally provide consumers with a reasonable opportunity to ""opt-out"" of having nonpublic personal information disclosed to unaffiliated third parties. Numerous jurisdictions have passed, and may in the future pass, new laws related to the use and retention of consumer information and this area continues to be an area of interest for U.S. federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities. These laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and our current data protection policies and practices may not be consistent with all of those interpretations and applications. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state regulatory requirements, as well as requirements imposed by governmental authorities in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, could result in more stringent requirements and in a need to change business practices, including the types of information we can use and the manner in which we can use such information. Establishing systems and processes to achieve compliance with these new requirements may increase our costs or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities.A security breach of our systems, or third party systems on which we rely, resulting in unauthorized access to personal client information, may adversely affect the demand for our services and products, our reputation, and financial performance.We offer a range of services and products to our clients, including assisted and DIY tax return preparation solutions, and financial products and services. Due to the nature of these services and products, we use multiple digital technologies to collect, transmit, and store high volumes of personal client information. Information security risks to companies that use digital technologies continue to increase due in part to the increased adoption of and reliance upon these technologies by companies and consumers. Our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened due to a variety of factors including, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats and related regulation, the increased sophistication of organized crime, cyber criminals and hackers, the prominence of our brand, our and 82017 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.Table of Contentsour franchisees' extensive office footprint, our plans to continue to implement strategies for our online and mobile applications and our desktop software, and our use of third-party vendors. Cybersecurity risks may result from fraud or malice (a cyber attack), human error, or accidental technological failure. Cyber attacks are designed to electronically circumvent network security for malicious purposes such as unlawfully obtaining personal client information, disrupting our ability to offer services, damaging our brand and reputation, stealing our intellectual property, and advancing social or political agendas. We face a variety of cyber attack threats including computer viruses, malicious codes, worms, phishing attacks, social engineering, denial of service attacks, ransomware, and other sophisticated attacks. We maintain multiple levels of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate the risk of a security breach. We regularly test our systems to discover and address potential vulnerabilities, and we rely on training and testing of our employees regarding heightened phishing and social engineering threats. Due to the structure of our business model, we also rely on our franchisees and other private and governmental third parties to maintain secure systems and respond to cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes, and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access remain a high priority for us. As risks and regulations continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Notwithstanding these efforts, there can be no assurance that a security breach, intrusion, or loss or theft of personal client information will not occur.A breach of our security measures or those of our franchisees or third parties on whom we rely, or other fraudulent activity, could result in unauthorized access to personal client information. If such an event were to occur, it could have serious short and long term negative consequences. Security breach remediation could require us to expend significant resources to notify or assist impacted clients, repair damaged systems, implement improved information security measures, and maintain client and business relationships. Other consequences could include reduced client demand for our services and products, loss of valuable intellectual property, reduced growth and profitability and negative impacts to future financial results, loss of our ability to deliver one or more services or products (e.g., inability to provide financial transaction services or to accept and process client credit card orders or tax returns), litigation, harm to our reputation and brands, fines, penalties, and other damages, and further regulation and oversight by U.S. federal, state, or foreign governmental authorities. A security breach or other unauthorized access to our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Stolen identity refund fraud could impede our clients' ability to timely and successfully file their tax returns and receive their tax refunds, and could diminish consumers' perceptions of the security and reliability of our products and services, resulting in negative publicity. Increased governmental regulation to attempt to combat that fraud could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.Companies offering tax preparation services (especially those offering DIY solutions) have seen a rise in instances of criminals utilizing stolen information obtained through hacking, phishing, and other means of identity theft in order to electronically file fraudulent federal and state tax returns. As a result, impacted taxpayers must complete additional forms and go through additional steps in order to report to appropriate authorities that their identities have been stolen and their tax returns were filed fraudulently. Though we offer assistance in the refund recovery process and offer our Tax Identity Shield® product to help protect clients, stolen identity refund fraud could impede our clients' ability to timely and successfully file their returns and receive their tax refunds, and could diminish consumers' perceptions of the security and reliability of our products and services, resulting in negative publicity, despite there having been no breach in the security of our systems. In addition, if stolen identity refund fraud is perpetrated at a material level through our products or services, state, federal or foreign tax authorities may refuse to allow us to continue to process our clients' tax returns electronically. As a result, stolen identity refund fraud could harm our revenue, results of operations, and reputation.Federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate have taken action, and may in the future take additional action, in an attempt to combat stolen identity refund fraud, which may require changes to our systems and business practices, in ways that we cannot anticipate. These actions may have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.H&R Block, Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K9Table of ContentsOur clients may access our services and products from personal or public computers and mobile devices and may install and use our DIY desktop software on their computers. Those computers and other devices may have outdated systems, may run software that is no longer supported, or may not have security patches installed on a timely basis. As a result, a person with malicious intent could obtain user account and password information from our clients through hacking, phishing, or other means of cyber attack, in order to perpetrate stolen identity refund fraud and otherwise cause losses for our clients. It has been reported that a number of companies, including some in the tax return preparation industry, have experienced instances where criminals gained unauthorized and illegal access to their systems by using stolen identity information obtained from sources other than those companies. The unauthorized and illegal access to those systems was used by criminals to perpetrate a variety of crimes, including stolen identity refund fraud. We could experience this form of unauthorized and illegal access to our systems, despite there having been no breach in the security of our systems, which could negatively impact our clients and harm our revenue, results of operations and reputation. Additionally, if such unauthorized or illegal access occurs, we may be subject to claims and litigation by clients, non-clients, or governmental agencies. An interruption in our information systems, or those of our franchisees or a third party on which we rely, or an interruption in the internet, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. We and our franchisees rely heavily upon communications, networks, and information systems and the internet to conduct our business. These networks, systems, and operations are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from upgrades and maintenance, network failure, hardware failure, software failure, power or telecommunications failures, cyber attacks involving the penetration of our network by hackers or other unauthorized users (e.g., through computer viruses and worms, malicious code, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, information security breaches, or other negative disruptions to the operation of the internet), human error and natural disasters. As our businesses are seasonal, our systems must be capable of processing high volumes during our peak periods. Therefore, any failure or interruption in our information systems, or information systems of our franchisees or a private or government third party on which we rely, or an interruption in the internet or other critical business capability, could negatively impact our business operations and increase our risk of loss. There can be no assurance that system or internet failures, or interruptions in critical business capabilities will not occur, or, if they do occur, that we, our franchisees or the private or governmental third parties on whom we rely, will adequately address them. The precautionary measures that we have implemented to avoid systems outages and to minimize the effects of any data or communication systems interruptions or failures may not be adequate in all circumstances, and we may not have anticipated or addressed all of the potential events that could threaten or undermine our information systems or other critical business capabilities. The occurrence of any systems or internet failure, or business interruption could negatively impact our ability to serve our clients, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Government tax reform initiatives that simplify or otherwise modify tax return preparation requirements or expedite refunds could have a material effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Tax reform is a focus of the federal government, but it is not clear what form tax reform proposals or related legislation or regulatory action may take, or whether any such legislation or regulatory action will ultimately be adopted and passed into law. There are various initiatives seeking to simplify or otherwise modify the preparation and filing of federal tax returns, including preparation of tax returns directly by the IRS, and to provide additional assistance with respect to preparing and filing such tax returns or expediting refunds. H&R Block is a member of Free File, which provides the ability for low-income taxpayers to prepare and file their own federal tax returns online for free. The IRS has in the past explored the possibility of allowing taxpayers to allocate a portion of their tax refunds to pay tax preparation fees, which could reduce the demand for RTs, but the IRS has not advanced this initiative. Taxing authorities in various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have also introduced measures seeking to simplify or otherwise modify the preparation and filing of tax returns in their respective jurisdictions. The adoption or expansion of any measures that significantly modify the Internal Revenue Code, simplify tax return preparation, expedite refunds, or otherwise reduce the need for third-party tax return preparation services could 102017 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.Table of Contentsreduce demand for our services and products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB to administer and, in some cases, enforce U.S. federal financial consumer protection laws and expanded the role of state regulators with respect to consumer protection laws. Regulations promulgated by the CFPB or other regulators may affect our financial services businesses in ways we cannot predict, which may require changes to our financial products, services, and contracts.The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB and gave it broad powers to administer, investigate compliance with, and, in some cases, enforce U.S. federal financial consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of financial consumer protection laws that apply to banks and other financial services companies, including the authority to prohibit ""unfair, deceptive, or abusive"" acts and practices. The CFPB may examine, investigate, and take enforcement actions against our subsidiaries that provide consumer financial services and products, as well as financial institutions and service providers upon which our subsidiaries rely to provide consumer financial services and products. The Dodd-Frank Act also expanded the role of state regulators in enforcing and promulgating financial consumer protection laws, the results of which could be states issuing new and broader financial consumer protection laws, some of which could be more comprehensive than existing U.S. federal regulations. Currently proposed or new CFPB and state regulations may require changes to our financial products, services and contracts, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Examples of recent CFPB action include the following:▪On May 5, 2016, the CFPB issued a request for comments on its proposal to prohibit mandatory consumer arbitration clauses in consumer financial product contracts. We, and certain of our third party service providers, utilize consumer arbitration clauses in connection with all of our consumer financial services products. It is not clear when the CFPB will publish the final version of these rules, or what their content will be. It is possible that, if the CFPB issues final rules that prohibit our use of consumer arbitration clauses, the risk of litigation involving our consumer financial products could increase, and the revenue that we derive from our consumer financial products could decline, as the result of adverse outcomes of litigation, increased volume of litigation, and the expense of defending such litigation.▪On June 2, 2016, the CFPB issued proposed rules that would change the regulation of many forms of consumer credit. It is not clear when the CFPB will publish the final version of these rules, or what their content will be. It is possible that the final rules, when enacted, could impact EAs and RAs. It is also possible that, depending on the form of the final rules, changes would be necessary to EAs and RAs to comply with the final rules, and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on the revenue that we derive from EAs.▪On October 5, 2016, the CFPB released its final rules regulating prepaid products (Final Rules). The Final Rules are scheduled to take effect on April 1, 2018, with certain provisions phased in over time following that date. If the Final Rules become effective as released, they will apply to the H&R Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard®, but we do not believe they will apply to EAs or RA loans due to their nature as non-covered separate credit products. The Final Rules, among other things: (i) establish required consumer disclosures to be made prior to acquiring a prepaid account in most situations; (ii) require periodic statements or online access to specified account information; and (iii) require online posting of the Cardholder Agreement and submission of new and revised Cardholder Agreements to the CFPB. We are continuing to assess the impact of these changes on the H&R Block Emerald Prepaid MasterCard® and our consolidated financial statements.The nature of our tax service and product offerings requires timely product launches. Any significant delays in launching our tax service and product offerings, changes in government regulations or processes that affect how we provide such offerings to our clients, or significant problems with such offerings or the manner in which we provide them to our clients may harm our revenue, results of operations, and reputation.Tax laws and tax forms are subject to change each year, and the nature and timing of such changes are unpredictable. As a part of our business, we must incorporate any changes to tax laws and tax forms into our tax service and product offerings, including our online and mobile applications and desktop software. The unpredictable nature and timing of changes to tax laws and tax forms can result in condensed development cycles for our tax service and product offerings because our clients expect high levels of accuracy and a timely launch of such offerings to prepare and file their taxes by the tax filing deadline and, in turn, receive any tax refund amounts on a timely basis. In addition, H&R Block, Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K11Table of Contentsgovernmental authorities regularly change their processes for accepting tax filings and related tax forms. Further, changes in governmental administrations or regulations could result in a delay of the start of the tax season or in further and unanticipated changes in requirements or processes. Changes in governmental regulations and processes that affect how we provide services and products to our clients may require us to make corresponding changes to our client service systems and procedures. Furthermore, unanticipated changes in governmental processes for accepting tax filings and related forms, or the ability of taxing authorities to accept electronic tax return filings, may result in delays in our processing of our clients' tax filings, or delays in tax authorities accepting electronic tax return filings, and, in turn, delay any tax refund amounts to which such clients may be entitled. From time to time, we review and enhance our quality controls for preparing accurate tax returns, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent all inaccuracies. Any significant delays in launching our tax service and product offerings, changes in government regulations or processes that affect how we provide such offerings to our clients, or significant problems with such offerings or the manner in which we provide them to our clients may harm our revenue, results of operations, and reputation.If we encounter development challenges or discover errors in our systems, services or products, we may elect to delay or suspend our offerings. Any major defects or launch delays, or failure to anticipate changes in governmental processes for accepting tax filings and related forms, may lead to loss of clients and revenue, negative publicity, client and employee dissatisfaction, a deterioration in our business relationships with our franchisees, reduced retailer shelf space and promotions, exposure to litigation, and increased operating expenses. Any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Regulatory actions could have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The Company is subject to additional federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations that affect the Company, including, without limitation, in the areas of franchise, labor, immigration, advertising, consumer protection, financial services and products, payment processing, privacy, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety, insurance, and healthcare. There have been significant new regulations and heightened focus by the government in some of these areas, including, for example, healthcare, consumer financial services and products, and labor, including overtime and exemption regulations and state and local laws on minimum wage and other labor-related issues. There may be additional regulatory actions or enforcement priorities, or new interpretations of existing requirements that differ from ours. These developments could impose unanticipated limitations or require changes to our business, which may make elements of our business more expensive, less efficient, or impossible to conduct, and may require us to modify our current or future services or products, which effects may be heightened given the nature, broad geographic scope, and seasonality of our business.We rely on a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key services or products, and the inability of these key vendors to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Historically, we have contracted, and in the future we will likely continue to contract, with a single vendor or a limited number of vendors to provide certain key services or products for our tax, financial, and other services and products. Two examples of this type of reliance are our relationships with Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (FIS), for data processing and card production services, and BofI, as discussed in Item 1. In certain instances, we are vulnerable to vendor error, service inefficiencies, service interruptions, or service delays. Our sensitivity to any of these issues may be heightened (1) due to the seasonality of our business, (2) with respect to any vendor that we utilize for the provision of any product or service that has specialized expertise, (3) with respect to any vendor that is a sole or exclusive provider, or (4) with respect to any vendor whose indemnification obligations are limited or that does not have the financial capacity to satisfy its indemnification obligations. Some of our vendors are subject to the oversight of regulatory bodies and, as a result, our product or service offerings may be affected by the actions or decisions of such regulatory bodies. Vendor failures could occur in various ways including (1) vendor error, (2) inability to meet our needs in a timely manner, or (3) termination or delay in the services or products provided by a vendor because the vendor fails to perform adequately, is no longer in business, experiences shortages, or discontinues a certain product or service that we utilize. If our vendors are unable to meet our needs and we are not able to develop 122017 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.Table of Contentsalternative sources for these services and products quickly and cost-effectively, it could result in a material and adverse impact on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The specialized and highly seasonal nature of our business presents financial risks and operational challenges, which, if not satisfactorily addressed, could materially affect our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Our business is highly seasonal, with the substantial portion of our revenue earned in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Success in our industry depends on our ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain key personnel in a timely manner, including members of our executive team, and those in seasonal tax preparation positions or with other required specialized expertise, including technical positions. The market for such personnel is extremely competitive, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain the required personnel within necessary timeframes. If we are unable to attract, develop, motivate, and retain key personnel, our business, operations, and financial results could be negatively impacted.The concentration of our revenue-generating activity during this relatively short period presents a number of additional challenges for us, including (1) cash and resource management during the first nine months of our fiscal year, when we generally operate at a loss and incur fixed costs and costs of preparing for the upcoming tax season, (2) ensuring compliance with financial covenants under our First Amended and Restated Credit and Guarantee Agreement (2016 CLOC), particularly if the timing of our revenue generation deviates from this seasonal period, (3) responding to changes in competitive conditions, including marketing, pricing, and new product offerings, which could affect our position during the tax season, (4) disruptions in a tax season, including any customer dissatisfaction issues, which may not be timely discovered or satisfactorily addressed, and (5) ensuring optimal uninterrupted operations and service delivery during the tax season. If we experience significant business disruptions during the tax season or if we are unable to satisfactorily address the challenges described above and related challenges associated with a seasonal business, we could experience a loss of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.We face litigation in connection with our various business activities, and current or future litigation may damage our reputation, impair our product offerings, or result in material liabilities and losses.We have been named, and from time to time will likely continue to be named, in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class or representative actions, actions or inquiries by state attorneys general, and other litigation arising in connection with our various business activities, including relating to our various service and product offerings. We also grant our franchisees a limited license to use our registered trademarks and, accordingly, there is risk that one or more of the franchisees may be alleged to be controlled by us. Third parties, regulators or courts may seek to hold us responsible for the actions or failures to act by our franchisees. Adverse outcomes related to litigation could result in substantial damages and could cause our earnings to decline. Negative public opinion could also result from our subsidiaries' or franchisees' actual or alleged conduct in such claims, possibly damaging our reputation, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business prospects and cause the market price of our securities to decline.In addition, we have been sued, and certain of our competitors have been sued, in connection with the offering of different types of RT products. Further, we have received an inquiry from the California Attorney General requesting information regarding our RT product. In a case involving one of our competitors, a California appellate court affirmed a trial court's ruling that the competitor's specific version of a RT product was subject to truth-in-lending and other related laws. Following the appellate court's ruling, the case was denied further appellate review. We believe there are differences that distinguish our RT product from the product that was the subject of the competitor's case described above. Revenues from our RT product totaled $148 million in fiscal year 2017; any requirement that materially alters our offering of RTs, including limitations on the fees we charge or disclosure requirements that could reduce the demand for these products, could have a material adverse impact on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Our access to liquidity may be negatively impacted as disruptions in credit markets occur, if credit rating downgrades occur, or if we fail to meet certain covenants. Funding costs may increase, leading to reduced earnings.We need liquidity to meet our off-season working capital requirements, to service debt obligations including refinancing of maturing obligations, and for general corporate purposes. Our access to and the cost of liquidity could H&R Block, Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K13Table of Contentsbe negatively impacted in the event of credit rating downgrades or if we fail to meet existing financial covenants. In addition, events could occur which could increase our need for liquidity above current levels.If rating agencies downgrade our credit rating, the cost of debt under our existing financing arrangements, as well as future financing arrangements, could increase and capital market access could decrease or become unavailable. Our 2016 CLOC is subject to various covenants, and a violation of a covenant could impair our access to liquidity currently available through the 2016 CLOC. The 2016 CLOC includes provisions that allow for the issuance of equity to comply with the financial covenant calculations as a means to avoid a shortfall. If current sources of liquidity were to become unavailable, we would need to obtain additional sources of funding, which may not be available or may only be available under less favorable terms. This could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The continued payment of dividends on our common stock and repurchases of our common stock are dependent on a number of factors, and future payments and repurchases cannot be assured.We need liquidity sufficient to fund payments of dividends on our common stock and repurchases of our common stock. In addition, holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments, and our Board of Directors may only authorize the Company to repurchase shares of our common stock with funds legally available for such repurchases. The payment of future dividends and future repurchases will depend upon our earnings, economic conditions, liquidity and capital requirements, and other factors, including our debt leverage. Accordingly, we cannot make any assurance that future dividends will be paid, or future repurchases will be made, at levels comparable to our historical practices, if at all. Due to the seasonal nature of our business and the fact that our business is not asset-intensive, there may be periods of time during our fiscal year in which the payment of dividends or stock repurchases may cause us to have a negative net worth under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). Our businesses may be adversely affected by difficult economic conditions, in particular, high unemployment levels.Difficult economic conditions are frequently characterized by high unemployment levels and declining consumer and business spending. These poor economic conditions may negatively affect demand and pricing for our services and products. In the event of difficult economic conditions that include high unemployment levels, especially within client segments we serve, clients may elect not to file tax returns or seek lower cost preparation and filing alternatives. Sustained levels of high unemployment may negatively impact our ability to increase or retain tax preparation clients.Our business depends on our strong reputation and the value of our brands.Developing and maintaining awareness of our brands is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future services and products and is an important element in attracting new clients. In addition, our franchisees may operate their businesses under our brands. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to events or activities involving or attributed to us, our franchisees, employees, or agents or our services or products, which may be enhanced due to the nature of social media, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brands. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our services and products and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands.Failure to protect our intellectual property rights may harm our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third party allegations of infringement may be costly. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information, we may be unable to do so effectively in all cases. Our intellectual property could be wrongfully acquired as a result of a cyber attack or other wrongful conduct by employees or third parties. To the extent that our intellectual property is not protected effectively by trademarks, copyrights, patents, or other means, other parties with knowledge of our intellectual property, including former employees, may seek to exploit our intellectual property for their own or others' advantage. Competitors may also misappropriate our trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights or duplicate our technology and products. Any significant impairment or misappropriation of our intellectual property or proprietary information could harm our business and our brand, and may adversely affect our ability to compete. In addition, third parties may allege we are infringing their intellectual property rights, and we may face intellectual property challenges from other parties. We may not be successful in defending against any such challenges or in 142017 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.Table of Contentsobtaining licenses to avoid or resolve any intellectual property disputes and, in that event, we could lose significant revenues, incur significant license, royalty, or technology development expenses, suffer harm to our reputation, or pay significant monetary damages.Failure to maintain sound business relationships with our franchisees may have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Our financial success depends in significant part on our ability to maintain sound business relationships with our franchisees. The support of our franchisees is also critical for the success of our marketing programs and any new strategic initiatives we seek to undertake. Deterioration in our relationships with our franchisees or the failure of our franchisees to support our marketing programs and strategic initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Our international operations are subject to risks which may harm our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.We have international operations, including in Canada and Australia, and may consider expansion opportunities in additional countries in the future. There is uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from new or emerging foreign operations and expand into other international markets. Additionally, there are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including: (1) changes in trade regulations; (2) difficulties in managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences; (3) profit repatriation restrictions, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; (4) geopolitical events, including acts of war and terrorism, and economic and political instability; (5) compliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable foreign anti-corruption laws; (6) compliance with U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those concerning privacy, and data protection and retention; and (7) risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local laws. These risks inherent in our international operations and expansion could increase our costs of doing business internationally and could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.In addition, we prepare tax returns for taxpayers residing in foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union (EU), and we operate and have franchisees who operate in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, certain aspects of our operations are subject to the laws, regulations, and policies of those jurisdictions that regulate the collection, use, and transfer of personal data, and in the future we may be subject to additional, more stringent requirements, including those found in the EU General Data Protection Regulation. Costs for us to comply with such laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to us could be significant.  We may also face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to these laws, regulations, and policies that could result in the imposition of penalties or fines.We may be adversely impacted by changes in corporate tax rates, the adoption of new tax legislation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and exposure to additional tax liabilities. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions where our subsidiaries are organized and conduct their operations. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries are organized and conduct their operations may change significantly as a result of political or economic factors beyond our control. Additionally, our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Our tax returns and other tax matters are periodically examined by tax authorities and governmental bodies, including the IRS, which may disagree with positions taken by us in determining our tax liability. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. As described above, tax reform is a focus of the federal government, and there are competing proposals regarding changes to the corporate tax rate. If enacted, corporate tax reform may significantly change the U.S. corporate tax rate and the tax rules to which we are subject. In addition, projects undertaken by international organizations may change international tax norms relating to each country’s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade. Given the unpredictability of these and other possible changes to tax laws and related regulations, it is difficult to assess H&R Block, Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K15Table of Contentsthe overall effect of such potential changes, but any such changes could, if adopted and applicable to us, adversely impact our effective tax rates. If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected. RISKS RELATING TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSSand Canyon Corporation, previously known as Option One Mortgage Corporation (including its subsidiaries, collectively, SCC) is subject to potential contingent losses related to representation and warranty claims, which may have an adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. SCC has accrued, and may in the future accrue, an estimated liability related to these contingent losses, which may not be adequate. SCC exited its mortgage business in fiscal year 2008. SCC remains exposed to losses relating to mortgage loans it previously originated. Mortgage loans originated by SCC were sold either as whole loans to single third-party buyers or in the form of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs). In connection with the sale of loans or RMBSs, SCC made certain representations and warranties. Claims under these representations and warranties together with any settlement arrangements related to these losses are collectively referred to as ""representation and warranty claims."" These representations and warranties varied based on the nature of the transaction and the buyer's or insurer's requirements, but generally pertained to the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, borrower fraud, the loan's compliance with the criteria for inclusion in the transaction, including compliance with SCC's underwriting standards or loan criteria established by the buyer, ability to deliver required documentation, and compliance with applicable laws. Representations and warranties related to borrower fraud in whole loan sale transactions to institutional investors, which were generally securitized by such investors and represented approximately 68% of the disposal of loans originated in calendar years 2005, 2006 and 2007, included a ""knowledge qualifier"" limiting SCC's liability to those instances where SCC had knowledge of the fraud at the time the loans were sold. Representations and warranties made in other sale transactions effectively did not include a knowledge qualifier as to borrower fraud. To the extent that any remaining repurchase obligations exist, SCC believes it would have an obligation to repurchase a loan only if it breached a representation and warranty and such breach materially and adversely affects the value of the mortgage loan or certificate holder's interest in the mortgage loan.The statute of limitations for a contractual claim to enforce a representation and warranty obligation is generally six years or such shorter limitations period that may apply under the law of a state where the economic injury occurred. On June 11, 2015, the New York Court of Appeals, New York's highest court, held in ACE Securities Corp. v. DB Structured Products, Inc., that the six-year statute of limitations under New York law starts to run at the time the representations and warranties are made, not the date when the repurchase demand was denied. This decision applies to claims and lawsuits brought against SCC where New York law governs. New York law governs many, though not all, of the transactions into which SCC entered. However, this decision would not affect representation and warranty claims and lawsuits SCC has received or may receive, for example, where the statute of limitations has been tolled by agreement or a suit was timely filed. In response to the statute of limitations rulings in the ACE case and similar rulings in other state and federal courts, parties seeking to pursue representation and warranty claims or lawsuits have sought, and may in the future seek, to distinguish certain aspects of the ACE decision, pursue alternate legal theories of recovery, or assert claims against other contractual parties such as securitization trustees. For example, a 2016 ruling by a New York intermediate appellate court allowed a counterparty to pursue litigation on additional loans in the same trust even though only some of the loans complied with the condition precedent of timely pre-suit notice and opportunity to cure or repurchase. Additionally, plaintiffs in litigation to which SCC is not party have alleged breaches of an independent contractual duty to provide notice of material breaches of representations and warranties, and pursued separate claims to which, they argue, the statute of limitations ruling in the ACE case does not apply. The impact on SCC, if any, from alternative legal theories seeking to avoid or distinguish the ACE decision, or judicial limitations on the ACE decision, is unclear.162017 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.Table of ContentsSCC has concluded that a loss related to certain representation and warranty claims is probable and has accrued a liability as of April 30, 2017, of $4.5 million. If SCC were required to pay material amounts with respect to contingent losses arising from representation and warranty claims, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, as SCC's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are included in our consolidated financial statements. Except where specified, the accrued liability does not include potential losses related to litigation matters discussed in the risk factor below and in Item 8, note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. Also see Item 8, note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.SCC is subject to potential contingent losses related to securitization transactions in which SCC participated as a depositor or loan originator, which may result in significant financial losses.Between January 2005 and November 2007, SCC originated mortgage loans totaling approximately $80 billion. Mortgage loans originated by SCC were sold either as whole loans to single third-party buyers, who generally securitized such loans, or in the form of RMBSs. SCC estimates approximately 90% of the loans it originated in 2005, 2006, and 2007 were securitized in approximately 110 securitization transactions. In most of these securitization transactions, SCC agreed, subject to certain conditions and limitations, to indemnify the underwriters or depositors for certain losses and expenses that the underwriters or depositors may incur as a result of certain claims made against them relating to loans originated by SCC, including certain legal expenses the underwriters or depositors incur in their defense of such claims. Some of those underwriters and depositors are defendants in lawsuits where various other parties allege a variety of claims, including violations of U.S. federal and state securities law and common law fraud based on alleged materially inaccurate or misleading disclosures, arising out of the activities of such underwriters or depositors in their sale of RMBSs or mortgage loans. Based on information currently available to SCC, it believes that the 21 lawsuits in which notice of a claim for indemnification has been made involve 39 securitization transactions with original investments of approximately $14 billion (of which the outstanding principal amount is approximately $4 billion). Certain of the notices received included, and future notices may include, a reservation of rights to assert claims for contribution, which are referred to herein as ""contribution claims."" Contribution claims may become operative if indemnification is unavailable or insufficient to cover all of the losses and expenses involved. These indemnification and contribution claims are frequently not subject to a contractual term or limit.In addition, securitization trustees are, or have been, involved in lawsuits related to securitization transactions in which SCC participated. Plaintiffs in these lawsuits allege, among other things, that originators, depositors, servicers or other parties breached their representations and warranties or otherwise failed to fulfill their obligations, including that securitization trustees breached their contractual obligations, breached their fiduciary duties, or violated statutory requirements by failing to properly protect the certificate holders’ interests.Additional lawsuits against the underwriters, depositors, or securitization trustees may be filed in the future, and SCC may receive additional notices of claims for indemnification or contribution from underwriters, depositors, or securitization trustees with respect to existing or new lawsuits or settlements of such lawsuits. In addition, other counterparties to the securitization transactions, including certificate holders and monoline insurance companies, have filed or may file lawsuits, or may assert indemnification claims, directly against depositors and loan originators in securitization transactions alleging a variety of claims, including U.S. federal and state securities law violations, common law torts and fraud and breach of contract claims, among others. Additional or new lawsuits or claims may be filed or asserted against SCC in the future. We have not concluded that a loss related to any of these indemnification or contribution claims is probable and have not accrued a liability for these claims. However, if SCC were required to pay material amounts with respect to these matters, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows, as SCC's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows are included in our consolidated financial statements. See Item 8, note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.H&R Block has guaranteed the payment of certain limited claims against SCC.SCC is subject to representation and warranty claims by counterparties to SCC whole loan sales and securitization transactions, including certificate holders, securitization trustees, monoline insurance companies, and subsequent purchasers of whole loans. In certain limited circumstances described below, H&R Block guaranteed payment if claims are successfully asserted by such counterparties.H&R Block, Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K17Table of ContentsThese guarantees include representation and warranty claims with respect to a limited number of whole loan sales by SCC with an aggregate outstanding principal and liquidated amount of approximately $1.0 billion as of April 30, 2017, based on the data available to SCC. There have been a total of approximately $41 million of representation and warranty claims with respect to these whole loan sales.These guarantees also cover limited representation and warranty claims on other outstanding securitization transactions, with a potential claims exposure of less than $200 million. In addition, as is customary in divestiture transactions, H&R Block guaranteed the payment of any indemnification claims from the purchaser of SCC's servicing business, including claims relating to pre-closing services (closing occurred in 2008).We could be subject to claims by the creditors of SCC.As discussed above, SCC is subject to representation and warranty claims, indemnification and contribution claims, and other claims and litigation related to its past sales and securitizations of mortgage loans. Additional claims and litigation may be asserted in the future. If the amount that SCC is ultimately required to pay with respect to these claims and litigation, together with related administration and legal expense, exceeds its net assets, the creditors of SCC, or a bankruptcy trustee if SCC were to file or be forced into bankruptcy, may attempt to assert claims against us for payment of SCC's obligations. Claimants have also attempted, and may in the future attempt, to assert claims or seek payment directly from the Company even if SCC's assets exceed its liabilities. SCC's principal assets, as of April 30, 2017, total approximately $318 million and consist primarily of an intercompany note receivable. We believe our legal position is strong on any potential corporate veil-piercing arguments; however, if this position is challenged and not upheld, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, in certain limited instances, H&R Block guaranteed amounts as outlined in the above risk factor"

RISK FACTORSThere are a number of significant factors which could cause actual conditions, events or results todiffer materially from those described in forward-looking statements, many of which are beyondmanagements control or its ability to accurately forecast or predict. In addition, other factorsbesides those listed below or discussed in reports filed with the SEC could adversely affect ourresults, as this list is not a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties.Our access to liquidity may be negatively impacted if disruptions in credit markets occur, ifcredit rating downgrades occur or if we fail to meet certain covenants. Funding costs may increase,leading to reduced earnings.We need liquidity to meet our off-season working capital requirements, to service debt obligationsincluding refinancing of maturing obligations, and related activities. Although we believe we havesufficient liquidity to meet our current needs, our access to and the cost of liquidity could benegatively impacted in the event of credit-rating downgrades or if we fail to meet existing debtcovenants. In addition, events could occur which could increase our need for liquidity abovecurrent levels.     If rating agencies downgrade our credit rating, the cost of debt would likely increase andcapital market availability could decrease or become unavailable. Ourunsecured committed lines of credit (CLOCs) are subject to12Table of Contentsvarious covenants, including a covenant requiring that we maintain minimum equity equal to $650.0million, and a requirement that we reduce the aggregate outstanding principal amount of short-termdebt (as defined) to $200.0 million or less for a minimum period of thirty consecutive days duringthe period from March 1 to June 30 of each year. Violation of a covenant could impair our access toliquidity currently available through the CLOCs. If current sourcesof liquidity were to become unavailable, we would need to obtainadditional sources of funding, which may not be possible.The financial services industry faces substantial litigation risks, and such litigation may damageour reputation or result in material liabilities and losses.We have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, includingarbitrations, class actions, and other litigation, arising in connection with our various businessactivities. Adverse outcomes related to litigation could result in substantial damages and couldcause our earnings to decline. Negative public opinion can also result from our actual or allegedconduct in such claims, possibly damaging our reputation and could cause the market price of ourstock to decline. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings for additional information.Failure to comply with laws and regulations that protect our customers personal and financialinformation could result in significant fines, penalties and damages and could harm our brand andreputation.Privacy concerns relating to the disclosure of consumer financial information have drawn increasedattention from federal and state governments. The IRS generally prohibits the use or disclosure bytax return preparers of taxpayers information without the prior written consent of the taxpayer.In addition, other regulations require financial service providers to adopt and disclose consumerprivacy policies and provide consumers with a reasonable opportunity to opt-out of havingpersonal information disclosed to unaffiliated third-parties for marketing purposes. Although wehave established security procedures to protect against identity theft, breaches of our clientsprivacy may occur. To the extent the measures we have taken prove to be insufficient or inadequate,we may become subject to litigation or administrative sanctions, which could result in significantfines, penalties or damages and harm to our brand and reputation.     In addition, changes in these federal and state regulatory requirements could result in morestringent requirements and could result in a need to change business practices, including howinformation is disclosed. Establishing systems and processes to achieve compliance with these newrequirements may increase costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities.We are subject to operational risk, which may result in incurring financial and reputationallosses.There is a risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, theft or fraud.These can occur in many forms including, among others, errors, business interruptions,inappropriate behavior of or misconduct by our employees or those contracted to perform servicesfor us, and vendors that do not perform in accordance with their contractual agreements. Theseevents can potentially result in financial losses or other damages. We rely on internal andexternal information and technological systems to manage our operations and are exposed to risk ofloss resulting from breaches in the security or other failures of these systems. Replacement of ourmajor operational systems could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct our corebusiness operations and increase our risk of loss resulting from disruptions of normal operatingprocesses and procedures that may occur during the implementation of new information andtransaction systems.     We also face the risk that the design of our controls and procedures may prove to beinadequate or are circumvented, thereby causing delays in detection of errors or inaccuracies indata and information. It is possible that any lapses in the effective operations of controls andprocedures could materially affect earnings or harm our reputation. In an organization as large andcomplex as ours, lapses or deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting could bematerial to us.TAX SERVICESGovernment initiatives that simplify tax return preparation could reduce the need for our servicesas a third-party tax return preparer.Many taxpayers seek assistance from paid tax return preparers such as us because of the level ofcomplexity involved in the tax return preparation and filing process. From time to time, governmentofficials propose measures seeking to simplify the preparation and filing of tax returns or toprovide additional assistance with respect to preparing and filing such tax returns. The passage ofany measures that significantly13Table of Contentssimplify tax return preparation or otherwise reduce the need for a third-party tax return preparercould reduce demand for our services, causing our revenues or results of operations to decline.Federal and state legislators and regulators have increasingly taken an active role in regulating,and third-party financial institutions may cease or significantly reduce the offering of, financialproducts such as RALs. These trends or potential developments could impede our ability tofacilitate these financial products, reduce demand for our services and harm our business.Changes in government regulation related to RALs could limit theoffering of RALs  to our clients or ourability to purchase participation interests. Third-party financial institutions currentlyoriginating RALs and similar products could decide to cease or significantly limit such offeringsand related collection practices. Changes in IRS practices could impair our ability to limit ourbad debt exposure. Changes in any of these, as well as possible litigation related to RALs, maycause our revenues or results of operations to decline. See discussion of RAL litigation in Item 3,Legal Proceedings.     Loss of the RAL program could cause our revenues or profitability to decline. In addition tothe loss of revenues and income directly attributable to the RAL program, the inability to offerRALs could indirectly result in the loss of retail tax clients and associated tax preparationrevenues, unless we were able to take mitigating actions.     Total revenues related directly to the RAL program (including revenues from participationinterests) were $189.8 million for the year ended April 30, 2008, representing 4.3% of consolidatedrevenues and contributed $87.0 million to the Tax Services segments pretax results. Revenuesrelated directly to the RAL program totaled $193.5 million for the year ended April 30, 2007,representing 4.8% of consolidated revenues and contributed $120.5 million to pretax results.Increased competition for tax preparation clients in our retail offices, online and softwarechannels could adversely affect our current market share and profitability, and could limit ourability to grow our client base.The retail tax services business is highly competitive. There are a substantial number of taxreturn preparation firms and accounting firms offering tax return preparation services. Many taxreturn preparation firms and many firms not otherwise in the tax return preparation business areinvolved in providing electronic filing, RALs and other related services to the public. Commercialtax return preparers and electronic filers are highly competitive with regard to price and service.     Our digital tax solutions businesses compete with a number of companies. Price and marketingcompetition for tax preparation services increased in recent years.     See clients served statistics included in Item 7, under Tax Services.BUSINESS SERVICESOur alternative practice structure involves relationships with Attest Firms that are subject toregulatory restrictions and other constraints. Failure to comply withthese restrictions, or operational difficulties involving the AttestFirms,  could damage our brand reputation, lead toreduced earnings and impair our investment in RSM.Our relationship with the Attest Firms requires us to comply with applicable regulations regardingthe practice of public accounting and auditor independence rules and requirements. Many of ourclients are also clients of the Attest Firms. In addition, our relationship with the Attest Firmsclosely links our RSM McGladrey brand with the Attest Firms. If the Attest Firms were to encounterregulatory or independence issues resulting from their relationship with us or if significantlitigation arose involving the Attest Firms or their services, such developments could have anadverse effect on our brand reputation and our ability to realize the mutual benefits of ourrelationship. In addition, a significant judgment or settlement of a claim against the Attest Firmscould (1) impair M&Ps ability to repay amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility itmaintains with us, (2) impact RSMs ability to attract and retain clients and qualityprofessionals, (3) have a significant indirect adverse effect on RSM, as the Attest Firm partnersare also RSM employees, and (4) result in significant management distraction. This in turn couldresult in reduced revenue and earnings and, if sufficiently significant, impairment of ourinvestment in RSM.14Table of ContentsCONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICESWe are subject to extensive government regulation, including banking and securities rules andregulations. If we fail to comply with applicable securities and banking laws, rules andregulations, we could be subject to disciplinary actions, damages, penalties or restrictions thatcould significantly harm our business.The SEC, FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations and state securities commissions can, amongother things, censure, fine, issue cease-and-desist orders or suspend or expel a broker-dealer orany of its officers or employees. The OTS may take similar action with respect to our bankingactivities. Similarly, the attorneys general of each state could bring legal action on behalf ofthe citizens of the various states to ensure compliance with local laws.     HRBFA must comply with many laws and rules, including rules relating to possession and controlof customer funds and securities, margin lending and execution and settlement of transactions. TheSEC, FINRA and various other regulatory agencies have stringent rules with respect to themaintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker-dealers. Net capital is the networth of a broker or dealer (assets minus liabilities), less deductions for certain types ofassets. Failure to maintain the required net capital could result in suspension or revocation ofregistration by the SEC and suspension or expulsion by FINRA and could ultimately lead toliquidation.     HRB Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the OTS.Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may trigger actions by regulators that, if undertaken,could have a direct material effect on HRB Bank. HRB Bankmust meet specific capital guidelines involving quantitative measures of assets, liabilities andcertain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. A bankscapital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulatorsabout the strength of components of its capital, risk-weightings of assets, off-balance sheettransactions and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capitaladequacy require HRB Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of tangible equity, totalrisk-based capital and Tier 1 capital. In addition to these minimum ratio requirements, HRB Bank isrequired to continually maintain a 12.0% minimum leverage ratio through fiscal year 2012.     See Item 8, note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for the calculation of requiredratios.Economic conditions that negatively affect housing prices and the job market may result indeterioration in credit quality of our loan portfolio, and such deterioration could have a negativeimpact on our business.The overall credit quality of mortgage loans held for investment is impacted by the strength of theU.S. economy and local economic conditions, including residential housing prices. Economic trendsthat negatively affect housing prices and the job market could result in deterioration in creditquality of our mortgage loan portfolio and a decline in the value of associated collateral. Futureinterest rate resets could also lead to increased delinquencies in our mortgage loans held forinvestment. Recent trends in the residential mortgage loan market reflect an increase in loandelinquencies and declining collateral values. As a result of similar trends in our loan portfolio,we recorded significant loan loss provisions during fiscal year 2008.     Our loan portfolio is concentrated in the states of Florida, California, New York andWisconsin, which represented 19.9%, 17.3%, 12.8% and 8.8%, respectively, of our total mortgageloans held for investment at April 30, 2008. No other state held more than 5% of our loan balances.If adverse trends in the residential mortgage loan market continue, particularly in geographicareas in which we own a greater concentration of mortgage loans, we could incur additionalsignificant loan loss provisions.     Mortgage loans purchased from OOMC and its affiliates represented approximately 75% of totalloans held for investment at April 30, 2008. These loans have been subject to higher delinquencyrates than other loans in our portfolio, and may expose us to greater risk of credit loss.Downturns in the securities markets increase the credit risk associated with margin lending andstock loan transactions.We permit customers to purchase securities on margin. A downturn in the securities markets mayimpact the value of collateral held in connection with margin receivables and may reduce its valuebelow the amount borrowed, potentially creating collections issues with our margin receivables. Inaddition, we frequently borrow securities from and lend securities to other broker-dealers. Underregulatory guidelines, when we borrow or lend securities, we must generally simultaneously disburseor receive cash deposits. A sharp change in security market values may result in losses ifcounterparties to the borrowing and lending transactions fail to honor their commitments.15Table of ContentsOur ability to retain and attract qualified financial advisors is critical to the success of ourbusiness and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.Attracting and retaining experienced financial advisors is extremely competitive in the investmentindustry. Additionally, in this industry, clients tend to follow their advisors, regardless oftheir affiliated investment firm. The inability to recruit and retain qualified and productiveadvisors may cause our revenues or profitability to decline.Changes in interest rates may adversely affect our business, including net interest income andearnings.Net interest income is an important source of revenue for this segment. Our results of operationsdepend, in part, on our level of net interest income and our effective management of the impact ofchanging interest rates and varying asset and liability maturities.     HRB Bank raises funds by, among other things, accepting deposits from depositors, which we useto make loans to customers and invest in debt securities and other interest-earning assets. We earninterest on these loans and assets and pay interest on the money we borrow and on the deposits weaccept from depositors. Changes in interest rates, including changes in the relationship betweenshort-term rates and long-term rates, may have negative effects on our net interest income andearnings. Changes in interest rates and responses by our competitors to those changes may affectthe rate of customer prepayments for mortgages and the level of mortgage loan delinquencies. Thesechanges can reduce the overall yield on our assets. Changes in interest rates and responses by ourcompetitors to these changes may also affect customer decisions to maintain balances in the depositaccounts they have with us. These changes may require us to replace withdrawn balances withhigher-cost alternative sources of funding.     HRBFA holds interest bearing receivables from customers, brokers and dealers, which consistprimarily of amounts due on margin transactions and also earns a spread on customer balances heldin FDIC-insured bank accounts. We fund short-term margin balances with short-term variable rateliabilities from customers, brokers and dealers, including stock loan activity. Our fixed incomeportfolio is affected by changes in market rates and prices.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSOOMC is subject to potential contingent liabilities stemming from discontinued mortgage operations,which may result in significant financial losses.Litigation. Although OOMC terminated its mortgage loan origination activities and sold its loanservicing business during fiscal year 2008, it remains subject to investigations, claims andlawsuits pertaining to its loan origination and servicing activities prior to such termination andsale. The costs involved in defending against and/or resolving these investigations, claims andlawsuits may be substantial in some instances and the ultimate resulting liability is difficult topredict. In the current non-prime mortgage environment, the number and frequency of investigations,claims and lawsuits has increased over historical experience and is likely to continue at increasedlevels. In the event of unfavorable outcomes, the amount OOMC may be required to pay in thedischarge of liabilities or settlements could be substantial and, because OOMCs operating resultsare included in our consolidated financial statements, could have a material adverse impact on ourconsolidated results of operations.     Loan Repurchase Obligations. OOMC remains exposed to losses relating to mortgage loans itpreviously originated. Non-prime mortgage loans originated by OOMC were sold either as whole-loansales to single third-party buyers or in the form of a securitization. In the case of asecuritization, non-prime mortgage loans were pooled and sold as mortgage backed securities,generally with a residual interest retained by OOMC. Retained residuals were frequently pooled andsold in subsequent transactions referred to as net interest margin transactions.     OOMC entered into indemnification agreements with third-parties relating to mortgage loanstransferred through whole-loan sales or securitizations, which may require OOMC to repurchase loanspreviously sold or otherwise indemnify third-parties for losses incurred by them up to the agreedupon amount of indemnification.In some instances, H&R Block, Inc. was required to guarantee OOMCs obligations.Obligations to repurchase loans may arise from early paymentdefault provisions or representation and warranty breaches. Early payment default provisionsinvolved third-party whole-loan buyers whereby OOMC is generally required to repurchase loans ifthe first monthly payment due to the purchaser is not made. Given that OOMC ceased originatingloans in January 2008, we do not expect continuing risk of loss related to early payment defaults.Repurchase obligations may also arise from breaches of various representations and warranties OOMCmade when selling loans, which in turn may require OOMC to either repurchase the applicablemortgage loans or indemnify the purchaser or insurer. These16Table of Contentsrepresentations and warranties vary based on the nature of the transaction and the buyersrequirements but generally pertain to, among other things, (1) OOMCs ownership of the loan, (2)the validity of the lien securing the loan, (3) the absence of delinquent taxes or liens againstproperty securing the loan, (4) the effectiveness of title insurance on the property securing theloan, (5) the process used in selecting loans for inclusion in a transaction, (6) compliance withloan criteria established by the purchaser, (7) the accuracy of information provided by theborrowers, (8) compliance with OOMC underwriting guidelines,and (9) compliance with applicable laws. These representations and warranties andcorresponding repurchase obligations generally are not subject to stated limits or a stated termand, therefore, may continue for the foreseeable future.     When OOMC repurchases loans, it is subject to loss for the difference between the principalamount of the loan (together with accrued interest) and the value it will realize upon resale ofthe loan or liquidation of the property securing the loan. OOMC routinely estimates futurepotential obligations relating to loan repurchases and records liabilities currently for losses itmay realize in the future. Future losses may exceed amounts currently reflected in the financialstatements and are impacted by the following factors: § The volume of claims by third-parties requesting OOMC to repurchase loans. Claim volumemay be impacted by future delinquencies in the underlying loans and/or actual or perceivedcredit loss exposure;  § OOMCs ability to defend against claims that do not represent valid representation andwarranty breaches;  § The value that OOMC is able to realize for loans actually repurchased. Those values areimpacted primarily by demand and pricing for mortgage loans in the secondary market, andresidential home prices.     To the extent that future claim volumes exceed current estimates, or the value of mortgageloans and residential home prices decline, future losses may be greater than these estimates andthose differences may be significant.The valuation of OOMCs residual interests and mortgage loans held for sale includes many estimatesand assumptions made by management surrounding interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit losses.Variation in the factors underlying these assumptions could affect our results of operations.AtApril 30, 2008, OOMC held residual interests valued at$16.7 million, mortgage loans held for sale (netof related allowances) totaling $13.0 million and real estate owned of $6.2 million. The mortgageindustry and housing market continue to be extremely volatile, which could result in furtherimpairments to OOMCs residual interests and mortgage loans held for sale. See additionaldiscussion of the performance of mortgage operations in Item 7, under Discontinued Operations."
11,HRB,BLOCK H & R INC,2007-06-29,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSIn this report, and from time to time throughout the year, we share our expectations for theCompanys future performance. The following explains the critical risk factors impacting ourbusiness and reasons actual results may differ from our expectations. This discussion does notintend to be a comprehensive list and there may be other risks and factors that may have an effecton our business.     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL  We use capital primarily to fund working capital requirements, paydividends, repurchase shares of our common stock and acquire businesses. We are also dependent oncommercial paper issuances and/or lines of credit to fund RAL participations and seasonal workingcapital needs. A disruption in such markets could adversely affect our access to these funds. Tomeet our future financing needs, we may issue additional debt or equity securities.     LITIGATION  We are involved in lawsuits in the normal course of our business related to RALs,our POM guarantee program, electronic filing of tax returns, Express IRAs, losses incurred bycustomers in their investment accounts, mortgage lending activities, business valuation servicesand other matters. Adverse outcomes related to litigation could result in substantial damages andcould adversely affect our results of operations. Negative public opinion can also result from ouractual or alleged conduct in such claims, possibly damaging our reputation and adversely affectingthe market price of our stock. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings for additional information.     PRIVACY OF CLIENT INFORMATION  Privacy concerns relating to the disclosure of consumerfinancial information have drawn increased attention from federal and state governments. The IRSgenerally prohibits the use or disclosure by tax return preparers of taxpayers information withoutthe prior written consent of the taxpayer. In addition, other regulations require financial serviceproviders to adopt and disclose consumer privacy policies and provide consumers with a reasonableopportunity to opt-out of having personal information disclosed to unaffiliated third parties formarketing purposes. Although we have established security procedures to protect against identitytheft, breaches of our clients privacy may occur. To the extent the measures we have taken proveto be insufficient or inadequate, we may become subject to litigation or administrative sanctions,which could result in significant fines, penalties or damages and harm to our brand and reputation.     In addition, changes in these federal and state regulatory requirements could result in morestringent requirements and could result in a need to change business practices, including howinformation is disclosed. These changes could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition and results of operations, and our ability to access the capital markets.     INTERNAL CONTROL CERTIFICATION  We have documented and tested our internal control proceduresin accordance with various SEC rules governing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX 404). SOX404 requires us to assess the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reportingannually, and obtain an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls from our IndependentRegistered Public Accounting Firm. Managements assessment of our internal controls over financialreporting may identify deficiencies that need to be addressed in our internal controls overfinancial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors. Should we, or ourindependent auditors, determine in future periods that we have a material weaknesses in ourinternal controls over financial reporting, our results of operations or financial condition may beadversely affected and the price of our common stock may decline.     OPERATIONAL RISK  There is a risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes orsystems, theft or fraud. These can occur in many forms including, among others, errors, businessinterruptions, inappropriate behavior of or misconduct by our employees or those contracted toperform services for us, and15Table of Contentsvendors that do not perform in accordance with their contractual agreements. These events canpotentially result in financial losses or other damages. We rely on internal and externalinformation and technological systems to manage our operations and are exposed to risk of lossresulting from breaches in the security, or other failures of these systems. Replacement of ourmajor operational systems could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct our corebusiness operations and increase our risk of loss resulting from disruptions of normal operatingprocesses and procedures that may occur during the implementation of new information andtransaction systems.     POTENTIAL SALE TRANSACTION  On April 19, 2007, we entered into an agreement to sell OOMC. Thepurchase price to be received in connection with the sale of OOMC will consist of payments based onthe fair value of the adjusted tangible net assets of OOMC (as defined in the agreement) as of thedate of sale less $300.0 million. Because the final sale price will be based on third-party bidsand valuations received at closing as well as the ultimate value received upon disposition ofcertain assets after closing, and because market conditions have changed and may changesignificantly during the period prior to closing, the value of the adjusted tangible net assets ofthe business at closing may be significantly different than the value as of April 30, 2007. Inaddition, the transaction is subject to various closing conditions, including that (1) OOMCmaintain at least $8.0 billion of total capacity in its warehouse facilities throughout the periodto the closing date (of which at least $2.0 billion is to be in the form of unused capacity at theclosing date), (2) OOMC have servicer ratings of at least RPS2 by Fitch, SQ2 by Moodys and AboveAverage by S&P, and (3) agreed upon regulatory and other approvals and consents be obtained. Seediscussion of warehouse facilities and related waivers in Item 7 under Off-Balance Sheet FinancingArrangements. If the closing conditions are not satisfied by the requisite time, the sale could beterminated. Failure to complete this transaction could adversely affect the market price of ourstock. If conditions in the non-prime mortgage industry, particularly in home appreciation, continue to decline, our operating results, capital levels and liquidity could benegatively impacted during the periods we continue to own OOMC.TAX SERVICESCOMPETITIVE POSITION  Increased competition for tax preparation clients in our retail offices,online and software channels could adversely affect our current market share and limit our abilityto grow our client base. See clients served statistics included in Item 7, under Tax Services.     REFUND ANTICIPATION LOANS  Changes in government regulation related to RALs could adverselyaffect our ability to offer RALs or our ability to purchase participation interests. Third-partyfinancial institutions currently originating RALs and similar products could decide to cease orsignificantly limit such offerings and related collection practices. Changes in IRS practices couldadversely affect our ability to use the IRS debt indicator to limit our bad debt exposure. Changesin any of these, as well as possible litigation related to RALs, may adversely affect our resultsof operations. See discussion of RAL litigation in Item 3, Legal Proceedings.     Since July 1996, we have been a party to agreements with HSBC and its predecessors toparticipate in RALs provided by a lending bank to H&R Block tax clients. During fiscal year 2006,we signed a new agreement with HSBC under which HSBC and its designated bank will provide fundingof all RALs offered through June 2011. We may extend this agreement for two successive one-yearperiods. If HSBC and its designated bank do not continue to provide funding for RALs, we could seekother RAL lenders to continue offering RALs to our clients or consider alternative fundingstrategies.     The RAL program is regularly reviewed both from a business perspective and to ensurecompliance with applicable state and federal laws. It is our intention to continue to offer the RALprogram in the foreseeable future.     Loss of the RAL program could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to the lossof revenues and income directly attributable to the RAL program, the inability to offer RALs couldindirectly result in the loss of retail tax clients and associated tax preparation revenues, unlesswe were able to take mitigating actions. Total revenues related directly to the RAL program(including revenues from participation interests) were $193.5 million for the year ended April 30,2007, representing 4.8% of consolidated revenues and contributed $120.5 million to the segmentspretax results. Revenues related directly to the RAL program totaled $179.3 million for the yearended April 30, 2006, representing 5.0% of consolidated revenues and contributed $106.5 million tothe segments pretax results.BUSINESS SERVICESALTERNATIVE PRACTICE STRUCTURE WITH ATTEST FIRMS  Our relationship with the Attest Firms requiresus to comply with applicable regulations regarding the practice of public accounting and auditorindependence rules and requirements. In addition, our relationship with the Attest Firms closelylinks our RSM McGladrey brand with the Attest Firms. If the Attest Firms were to encounterregulatory or independence issues resulting from their relationship with us or if significantlitigation arose16Table of Contentsinvolving the Attest Firms or their services which implicated RSM, our brand reputation and ourability to realize the mutual benefits of our relationship, such as the ability to attract andretain quality professionals, could be impaired.CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICESREGULATORY ENVIRONMENT  GENERAL  The securities and banking industries are subject to extensiveregulation. The SEC, the NYSE, the NASD and other self-regulatory organizations and statesecurities commissions can, among other things, censure, fine, issue cease-and-desist orders orsuspend or expel a broker-dealer or any of its officers or employees. The OTS may take similaraction with respect to our banking activities. Similarly, the attorneys general of each state couldbring legal action on behalf of the citizens of the various states to ensure compliance with locallaws.     REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT  BROKER-DEALER  HRBFA must comply with many laws and rules, includingrules relating to possession and control of customer funds and securities, margin lending andexecution and settlement of transactions.     The SEC, NYSE and NASD and various other regulatory agencies have stringent rules with respectto the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker-dealers. Net capital isthe net worth of a broker or dealer (assets minus liabilities), less deductions for certain typesof assets. Failure to maintain the required net capital could result in suspension or revocation ofregistration by the SEC and suspension or expulsion by the NYSE and/or NASD, and could ultimatelylead to the firms liquidation.     HRBFA will be transitioning individual clients in certain fee-in-lieu-of-commission accountsto a commission-based or alternative brokerage account, or to investment adviser accounts as aresult of recent court actions on an SEC rule. As of April 30, 2007, HRBFA had approximately $2.9billion of assets under management and realized approximately $24.0 million in revenue from theseaccounts for fiscal year 2007. During the process of converting these accounts, we are exposed torisk in advisor and client retention, product pricing and related production revenues.     REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT  BANKING  H&R Block, Inc., as a savings and loan holding company, andHRB Bank, as a federally chartered savings bank, are subject to extensive regulation, supervisionand examination by the OTS and FDIC. Such regulation covers all banking business, including lendingpractices, safeguarding deposits, capital structure, recordkeeping, transactions with affiliatesand conduct and qualifications of personnel.     HRB Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the OTS.Failure to meet minimum capital requirements may trigger actions by regulators that, if undertaken,could have a direct material effect on HRB Bank and our consolidated financial statements. HRB Bankmust meet specific capital guidelines involving quantitative measures of assets, liabilities andcertain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. A bankscapital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulatorsabout the strength of components of its capital, risk weightings of assets, off-balance sheettransactions and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capitaladequacy require HRB Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of tangible equity, totalrisk-based capital and Tier 1 capital. In addition to theseminimum ratio requirements, HRB Bank is required to continuallymaintain a 12.0% minimum leverage ratio as a condition ofits charter-approval order through fiscal year 2009. This condition was extended through fiscalyear 2012 as a result of a Supervisory Directive issued on May 29, 2007. There are no conditions orevents since March 31, 2007 that management believes havechanged HRB Banks category. We will monitor regulatorycompliance with this ratio monthly and discuss with the OTS in theevent the minimum is not maintained.     As of March 31, 2007, our most recent Thrift Financial Report (TFR) filing with the OTS, HRBBank was a well capitalized institution under the prompt corrective action provisions of theFDIC. See Item 8, note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.     H&R Block, Inc. is subject to a three percent minimum ratio of adjusted tangible capital toadjusted total assets, as defined by the OTS. We fell below the three percent minimum ratio atApril 30, 2007 and the OTS issued a Supervisory Directive on May 29, 2007. Failure to comply withthe Supervisory Directive could trigger additional discretionary actions by the OTS such as asupervisory agreement, cease-and-desist orders and civil monetary penalties. See Item 7,Regulatory Environment and Item 8, note 17 to the consolidated financial statements foradditional information, including discussion of our non-compliance with the three percent minimumcapital requirement and actions taken by the OTS. If we are not in a position to cure deficiencies,a resulting failure could impair our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock, acquirebusinesses and pay dividends.     CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK  The overall credit quality of HRB Banks mortgage loans heldfor investment is impacted by the strength of the U. S. economy and local economies. We continuallymonitor changes in the economy, particularly unemployment rates and housing prices, as thesefactors can impact the ability of borrowers to repay their loans. Economic trends that negativelyaffect housing prices and the job17Table of Contentsmarket could result in, among other things, deterioration in credit quality of our loan portfolio.Our loan portfolio is concentrated in the states of Florida, California, New York and Wisconsin,which represented 18.8%, 16.3%, 12.8% and 9.7%, respectively, of our total mortgage loans held forinvestment at April 30, 2007. No other state held more than 5% of our loan balances.     INTEGRATION INTO THE H&R BLOCK BRAND  We are working to foster an advice-based relationshipwith our tax clients through our retail tax office network. This advice-based relationship is keyto the integration of Consumer Financial Services into the H&R Block brand and deepening ourcurrent client relationships. If we are unable to successfully integrate, it may significantlyimpact our ability to differentiate our business from other financial service providers and growour client base.     RECRUITING AND RETENTION OF FINANCIAL ADVISORS  Attracting and retaining experiencedfinancial advisors is extremely competitive in the investment industry. Additionally, in thisindustry, clients tend to follow their advisors, regardless of their affiliated investment firm.The inability to recruit and retain qualified and productive advisors, may adversely affect ourresults of operations.     INTEREST RATE RISK  Net interest income is an important source of revenue for this segment.Our ability to manage interest rate risk could impact our financial condition. Our results ofoperations depend, in part, on our level of net interest income and our effective management of theimpact of changing interest rates and varying asset and liability maturities. Many factors affectinterest rates, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economicand political conditions.     RECURRING OPERATING LOSSES  Continuing operating losses at HRBFA mayimpact the valuation of goodwill and long-lived assets. Such losses could also necessitateadditional capital contributions to comply with regulatory requirements. The inability to operatethis segment in a profitable manner may adversely affect our results of operations.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL  We are dependent on the use of our off-balance sheet arrangements to fundour daily non-prime mortgage loan originations, and depend on the secondary market to securitizeand sell mortgage loans and residual interests. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are subject tocertain covenants, including a minimum net income financial covenant. As of April 30, 2007, OOMCdid not meet the minimum net income financial covenant contained in certain of its committedwarehouse facilities. This covenant requires OOMC to maintain a cumulative minimum net income of atleast $1 for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended April 30, 2007. On April 27, 2007, OOMCobtained waivers of the minimum net income financial covenants from all of the warehouse facilityproviders. These waivers extend through various dates. Two waivers are subject to OOMC having aspecified amount of total warehouse capacity. If we do not obtain extensions of facilities andwaivers that expire before July 31, 2007 or expand existingcapacity, we would be in violation of this warehouse capacityrequirement.     OOMC will not meet this financial covenant at July 31, 2007. We have, however, obtainedwaivers from a sufficient number of warehouse providers to allow OOMC to continue its off-balancesheet financing activities. At our current origination levels, we estimate we would only needwaivers for between $3.0 billion and $4.0 billion of available capacity at any given time. However,the sale of OOMC is subject to various closing conditions, including that OOMC maintain at least$8.0 billion of total capacity in its warehouse facilities throughout the period to the closingdate (of which at least $2.0 billion is to be in the form of unused capacity at the closing date).     If OOMC cannot obtain extensions or waivers, warehouse facility providers would have the rightto terminate their future funding obligations under the applicable warehouse facilities, terminateOOMCs right to service the loans remaining in the applicable warehouse or request funding of the10% guarantee. This termination could adversely impact OOMCs ability to fund new loans and ourability to complete the OOMC sales transaction. See additional discussion in Item 7, underOff-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements.     COMPETITIVE POSITION  The majority of our mortgage loan applications are submitted through anetwork of brokers who have relationships with many other mortgage lenders. Unfavorable changes inour pricing, service or other factors could result in a decline in our mortgage origination volume.A significant decline in our servicer ratings could adversely affect our pricing and originationvolume. Increased competition among mortgage lenders can also result in a decline in coupon ratesoffered to our borrowers, which in turn lowers margins and could adversely affect our gains onsales of mortgage loans.     MARKET RISKS  Our day-to-day operating activities of originating and selling mortgage loanshave many aspects of interest rate risk. Additionally, the valuation of our retained residualinterests and mortgage servicing rights includes many estimates and assumptions made by managementsurrounding interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit losses. Variation in interest rates or thefactors underlying our assumptions could affect our results of operations. See Item 7A, underDiscontinued Operations for discussion of interest rate risk, and Item 7, Critical AccountingPolicies for discussion of our valuation methodology.18Table of Contents     Conditions in the non-prime mortgage industry were challenging throughout fiscal year 2007,and particularly in our fourth quarter. Our mortgage operations, as well as the entire industry,were impacted by deteriorating conditions in the secondary market, where reduced investor demandfor loan purchases, higher investor yield requirements and increased estimates for future lossesreduced the value of non-prime loans. Under these conditions non-prime originators generallyreported significant increases in losses and many were unable to meet their financial obligations.As a result, during our fourth quarter our mortgage operations originated mortgage loans that, bythe time we sold them in the secondary market, were valued at less than par. Conditions in thenon-prime mortgage industry resulted in significant losses in our mortgage operations during thefourth quarter of fiscal year 2007. See additional discussion of the performance of our mortgageoperations in Item 7, under Discontinued Operations. If conditions in the non-prime mortgageindustry do not improve, it could adversely affect the results of our mortgage operations.     LEGISLATION AND REGULATION  Several states and cities are considering or have passed laws,regulations or ordinances aimed at curbing predatory lending and servicing practices. The federalgovernment is also considering legislative and regulatory proposals in this regard. In general,these proposals involve lowering the existing federal HOEPA thresholds for defining a high-costloan and establishing enhanced protections and remedies for borrowers who receive such loans. Ifunfavorable laws and regulations are passed, it could restrict our ability to originate loans. Ifrating agencies refuse to rate our loans, loan buyers may not want to purchase loans labeled ashigh-cost, and it could restrict our ability to sell our loans in the secondary market.Accordingly, all of these items could adversely affect our results of operations.     In 2002, the Federal Reserve Board adopted changes to Regulation C promulgated under the HMDA.Among other things, the new regulations require lenders to report pricing data on loans with annualpercentage rates that exceed the yield on treasury bills with comparable maturities by 3%. Theexpanded reporting was effective in 2004 for reports filed in 2005. We anticipate that a majorityof our loans would be subject to the expanded reporting requirements. The expanded reporting doesnot provide for additional loan information such as credit risk, debt-to-income ratio,loan-to-value ratio, documentation level or other salient loan features. However, reportedinformation may lead to increased litigation as the information could be misinterpreted by thirdparties and could adversely affect our results of operations.     COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK  Derivative instruments involve counterparty credit risk, which isthe risk that a counterparty may fail to perform on its contractual obligations. We manage thisrisk through the use of a policy that includes credit standard guidelines, counterpartydiversification, monitoring of counterparty financial condition, use of master netting agreementswith counterparties, and exposure limits based on counterparty credit, exposure amount andmanagement risk tolerance. The policy is reviewed on an annual basis and as conditions warrant. SeeItem 7A, under Discontinued Operations and Item 8, note 20 to our consolidated financialstatements for discussion of our derivative instruments.     DELINQUENCY RATES  Our underwriting criteria or collection methods may not provide adequateprotection against the risks inherent in the loans we originate and sell. In the event of adefault, we may be required to repurchase loans previously sold. Repurchased loans are normallysold in subsequent sale transactions. In the event a repurchased loan cannot be sold, thecollateral value of the financed item may not cover the outstanding loan balance and costs ofrecovery. In the event our mortgage loans held for sale or mortgage loans underlying our residualinterests in securitizations experience higher delinquencies, foreclosures, repossessions or lossesthan anticipated, our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected. Anysustained period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could harm our ability tooriginate and sell loans, the prices we receive on our loans, or the values of our mortgageservicing rights and residual interests in securitizations, which could adversely affect ourfinancial condition and results of operations. See additional discussion of our loan repurchases inItem 8, note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.     REAL ESTATE MARKET  Our residual interests and beneficial interest in Trusts are secured bymortgage loans, which are in turn secured by residential real estate. Any material decline in realestate values would likely result in higher delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures and losses.Additionally, a significant portion of the mortgage loans we originate or service is secured byproperties in California. A decline in the economy or the residential real estate market values, orthe occurrence of a natural disaster not covered by standard homeowners insurance policies, suchas an earthquake, hurricane or wildfire, could decrease the value of mortgaged properties"
7,HRB,BLOCK H & R INC,2006-06-30,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSIn this report, and from time to time throughout the year, we share our expectations for theCompanys future performance. The following explains the critical risk factors impacting ourbusiness and reasons actual results may differ from our expectations. This discussion does notintend to be a comprehensive list and there may be other risks and factors that may have an effecton our business.     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL  We use capital primarily to fund working capital requirements, paydividends, repurchase shares of our common stock and acquire businesses. We are dependent on theuse of our off-balance sheet arrangements to fund our daily non-prime originations and thesecondary market to securitize and sell mortgage loans and residual interests. See Item 7, underOff-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements. We are also dependent on commercial paper issuancesand/or bank lines to fund RAL participations and seasonal working capital needs. A disruption insuch markets could adversely affect our access to these funds. To meet our future financing needs,we may issue additional debt or equity securities.     LITIGATION  We are involved in lawsuits in the normal course of our business related toRALs, our Peace of Mind guarantee program, electronic filing of tax returns, Express IRAs, lossesincurred by customers in their investment accounts, mortgage lending activities and other matters.Adverse outcomes related to litigation could result in substantial damages and could adverselyaffect our results of operations. Negative public opinion can also result from our actual oralleged conduct in such claims, possibly damaging our reputation and adversely affecting the marketprice of our stock. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings for additional information.     PRIVACY OF CLIENT INFORMATION  We manage highly sensitive client information in all of ouroperating segments, which is regulated by law. Problems with the safeguarding and proper use ofthis information could result in regulatory actions and negative publicity, which could adverselyaffect our reputation and results of operations.     INTERNAL CONTROL CERTIFICATION  We have documented and tested our internal controlprocedures in accordance with various SEC rules governing Section 404 ofthe Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX 404). SOX 404 requires us to assess the effectiveness of our internalcontrols over financial reporting annually, and obtain an opinion on the effectiveness of thisinternal control from our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. We may14 encounter problemsor delays in completing the review and evaluation, the implementation of improvements and thereceipt of an attestation from our independent auditors. Additionally, managements assessment ofour internal controls over financial reporting may identify deficiencies that need to be addressedin our internal controls over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns forinvestors. Should we, or our independent auditors, determine in future periods that we have amaterial weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, our results of operations orfinancial condition may be adversely affected and the price of our common stock may decline.     OPERATIONAL RISK  There is a risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes orsystems, theft or fraud. These can occur in many forms including, among others, errors, businessinterruptions, inappropriate behavior of or misconduct by our employees or those contracted toperform services for us, and vendors that do not perform in accordance with their contractualagreements. These events can potentially result in financial losses or other damages. We rely oninternal and external information and technological systems to manage our operations and areexposed to risk of loss resulting from breaches in the security, or other failures of thesesystems. Replacement of our major operational systems could have a significant impact on ourability to conduct our core business operations and increase our risk of loss resulting fromdisruptions of normal operating processes and procedures that may occur during the implementationof new information and transaction systems.TAX SERVICESCOMPETITIVE POSITION  Increased competition for tax preparation clients in our retail offices,online and software channels could adversely affect our current market share and limit our abilityto grow our client base. See clients served statistics included in Item 7, under Tax Services.     REFUND ANTICIPATION LOANS  Changes in government regulation related to RALs could adverselyaffect our ability to offer RALs or our ability to purchase participation interests. Changes in IRSpractices could adversely affect our ability to use the IRS debt indicator to limit our bad debtexposure. Changes in any of these, as well as possible litigation related to RALs, may adverselyaffect our results of operations. See discussion of RAL litigation in Item 3, Legal Proceedings.MORTGAGE SERVICESCOMPETITIVE POSITION  The majority of our mortgage loan applications are submitted through anetwork of brokers who have relationships with many other mortgage lenders.

In addition, our relationship with the Attest Firms closelylinks our RSM McGladrey brand with the Attest Firms. If the Attest Firms were to encounterregulatory or independence issues resulting from their relationship with us or if significantlitigation arose involving the Attest Firms or their services which implicated RSM McGladrey, ourbrand reputation and our ability to realize the mutual benefits of our relationship, such as theability to attract and retain quality professionals, could be impaired.     INTEGRATION OF AMERICAN EXPRESS TAX AND BUSINESS SERVICES  The integration of AmericanExpress Tax and Business Services is proceeding according to plan. While we expect a successfulintegration, there is the potential that it could be delayed or otherwise impacted, which couldadversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.INVESTMENT SERVICESREGULATORY ENVIRONMENT  The broker-dealer industry continues to come under increased scrutiny byfederal and state regulators and self-regulatory organizations and, as a result, more focus hasbeen placed on compliance issues. If we do not comply with these regulations, it could result inregulatory actions and negative publicity, which could adversely affect our results of operationsand our ability to recruit and retain qualified advisors. Negative public opinion about ourindustry could damage our reputation even if we are in compliance with such regulations.     INTEGRATION INTO THE H&R BLOCK BRAND  We are working to foster an advice-based relationshipwith our tax clients through our retail tax office network. This advice-based relationship is keyto the integration of Investment Services into the H&R Block brand and deepening our current clientrelationships.
