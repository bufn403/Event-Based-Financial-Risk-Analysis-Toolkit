Among the risks are: (i) risks associated with our business, (ii) risks associated with ourcommon stock and (iii) risks associated with our industry. Our business, financial condition, cashflows or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.Risks Associated with Our Business     If we are not able to implement our growth strategy successfully, which includes opening newdomestic Buffet Units and reimaging existing restaurants, our ability to increase our revenues andoperating profits could be materially adversely affected.     A significant component of our growth strategy for developing new domestic franchised andCompany-owned restaurants is the implementation of our new prototype Buffet Unit concept. We andour franchisees face many challenges in opening new restaurants, including, among other things,selection and availability of suitable restaurant locations and suitable employees, increases infood, paper, labor, utilities, fuel, employee benefits, insurance and similar costs, negotiation ofsuitable lease or financing terms, constraints on permitting and construction of restaurants,higher than anticipated construction costs, the hiring, training and retention of management andother personnel and securing required domestic or foreign governmental permits and approvals.     The opening of additional franchise restaurants also depends, in part, upon the availabilityof prospective franchisees who meet our criteria. Our new concept development program may requireconsiderable management time as well as start-up expenses for franchisee recruitment and trainingand market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated.     Accordingly, we may not be able to meet planned growth targets, open restaurants in marketsnow targeted for expansion or operate profitably in existing markets. In addition, even if we areable to continue to open new restaurants, we may not be able to keep restaurants from closing at afaster rate than we are able to open restaurants.     Our earnings and business growth strategy depends on the success of our franchisees, and wemay be harmed by actions taken by our franchisees that are outside of our control.     A significant portion of our earnings comes from royalties generated by our franchisedrestaurants. Franchisees are independent operators whose employees are not our employees. Weprovide limited training and support to franchisees, but the quality of franchised restaurantoperations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. Consequently,franchisees may not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards andrequirements, or may not hire and train qualified managers and other store personnel. If they donot, our image and reputation may suffer, and revenues could decline. Our franchisees may takeactions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property or reputation. Our domesticand international franchisees may not operate their franchises successfully. If one or more of ourkey franchisees were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable or unwilling to pay us ourroyalties, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.     Loss of key personnel or our inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel couldhurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully.     Our success will depend to a significant extent on our leadership team and other keymanagement personnel. We may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel orattract additional qualified management. Our success also will depend on our ability to attractand retain qualified personnel to oversee our restaurants, distribution operations andinternational operations. The loss of these employees or any inability to recruit and retainqualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.     We face risks of litigation from customers, franchisees, employees and others in the ordinarycourse of business, which diverts our financial and management resources. Any adverse litigationor publicity may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.     Claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the foodservice industry. In addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting ourmanagement resources, adverse8Table of Contentspublicity or a substantial judgment against us could negatively impact our financialcondition, results of operations and brand reputation, hindering our ability to attract and retainfranchisees and grow our business.          Further, we may be subject to employee, franchisee and other claims in the future based on,among other things, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and wage, rest break and mealbreak issues, including those relating to overtime compensation. If one or more of these claimswere to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims, ourbusiness, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.          Shortages or interruptions in the delivery of food products could adversely affect ouroperating results.          We, and our franchisees, are dependent on frequent deliveries of food products that meet ourspecifications. Our Company-owned domestic restaurants purchase substantially all food and relatedproducts from our distribution division, Norco. Domestic franchisees are only required to purchasethe flour mixture, spice blend and certain other items from Norco, and changes in purchasingpractices by domestic franchisees as a result of delivery disruptions or otherwise could adverselyaffect the financial results of our distribution operation. Interruptions in the delivery of foodproducts caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution by Norco, oursuppliers, or our distribution service providers, inclement weather (including hurricanes and othernatural disasters) or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost ofingredients, which would adversely affect our operating results.          An increase in the cost of cheese or other commodities, including fuel and labor, couldadversely affect our profitability and operating results.          An increase in our operating costs could adversely affect our profitability. Factors such asinflation, increased food costs, increased labor and employee benefit costs and increased energycosts may adversely affect our operating costs. Most of the factors affecting costs are beyond ourcontrol and, in many cases, we may not be able to pass along these increased costs to our customersor franchisees even if we attempted to do so. Most ingredients used in our pizza, particularlycheese, are subject to significant price fluctuations as a result of seasonality, weather,availability, demand and other factors. Sustained increases in fuel and utility costs couldadversely affect the profitability of our restaurant and distribution businesses. Labor costs arelargely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our restaurant and distribution centerpersonnel and, generally, are a function of the availability of labor. Further governmentinitiatives, such as proposed minimum wage rate increases, could adversely affect us as well as therestaurant industry in general.          If we are not able to continue purchasing our key pizza ingredients from our current suppliersor find suitable replacement suppliers our financial results could be materially adverselyaffected.          We are dependent on a few suppliers for our some of our key ingredients. Domestically, werely upon sole suppliers for our cheese and flour mixture which are key ingredients. Alternativesources for these ingredients may not be available on a timely basis to supply these keyingredients or be available on terms as favorable to us as under our current arrangements. Anydisruptions in our supply of key ingredients could adversely affect our operations.          We are subject to extensive government regulation, and any failure to comply with existing orincreased regulations could adversely affect our business and operating results.          We are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, includingthose relating to:  the preparation and sale of food;   building and zoning requirements;   minimum wage, citizenship, overtime and other labor requirements;   compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act; and   working and safety conditions.          If we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we may be subject togovernmental or judicial fines or sanctions. In addition, our capital expenditures could increasedue to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any ofthese laws or regulations.9Table of Contents     We are also subject to a Federal Trade Commission rule and to various state and foreign lawsthat govern the offer and sale of franchises. These laws regulate various aspects of the franchiserelationship, including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises. The failure to complywith these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvalscould result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales, fines or other penalties,or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution, any of which could adversely affect ourbusiness and operating results.     Our current insurance coverage may not be adequate, our insurance premiums may increase and wemay not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates, or at all.     Our insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in ourbusiness. In addition, in the future our insurance premiums may increase and we may not be able toobtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms, or at all. Any such inadequacy of, orinability to obtain, insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition and results of operations.Risks Associated With Our Common Stock     Even though our common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, it has lessliquidity than the stock of many other companies quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Markets Global Marketor on a national securities exchange.     The trading volume in our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market has been relatively lowwhen compared with larger companies listed on the Nasdaq Global Market or the other stockexchanges. Shareholders, therefore, may experience difficulty selling a substantial number ofshares for the same price at which shareholders could sell a smaller number of shares. We cannotpredict the effect, if any, that future sales of our common stock in the market, or theavailability of shares of common stock for sale in the market, will have on the market price of ourcommon stock. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the market, or the potential forlarge amounts of sales in the market, may cause the price of our common stock to declineor impair our future ability to raise capital through sales of our common stock.     The market price of our common stock may fluctuate in the future, and these fluctuations maybe unrelated to our performance.     General market price declines or overall market volatility in the future could adverselyaffect the price of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of futuremarket prices.Risks Associated With Our Industry     If we are not able to compete effectively, our business, sales and earnings could bematerially adversely affected.     The restaurant industry in general, as well as the pizza segment of the industry, is intenselycompetitive, both internationally and domestically, with respect to price, service, location andfood quality. We compete against many regional and local businesses. There are manywell-established competitors with substantially greater brand awareness and financial and otherresources than we have. Some of these competitors may be better established in markets whererestaurants we operate or that are operated by our franchisees are, or may be, located. Experiencehas shown that a change in the pricing or other marketing or promotional strategies, including newproduct and concept developments, of one or more of our major competitors can have an adverseimpact on sales and earnings and our chainwide restaurant operations.     We could also experience increased competition from existing or new companies in the pizzasegment of the restaurant industry. If we are unable to compete, we could experience downwardpressure on prices, lower demand for our products, reduced margins, the inability to take advantageof new business opportunities and the loss of market share, all of which would have a materialadverse effect on our operating results.     We also compete on a broader scale with quick service, fast casual and other international,national, regional and local restaurants. The overall food service market and the quick servicerestaurant sector are intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price, service,convenience and concept. We also compete within the food service market and the restaurantindustry for management and hourly employees, suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees.10Table of Contents     Norco is also subject to competition from outside suppliers. If other suppliers who meet ourqualification standards were to offer lower prices or better service to our franchisees for theiringredients and supplies and, as a result, our franchisees chose not to purchase from Norco, ourfinancial condition, business and results of operations would be adversely affected.     Changes in consumer preferences and perceptions could decrease the demand for our products,which would reduce sales and harm our business.     Restaurant businesses are affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and localeconomic conditions, demographic trends, disposable purchasing power, traffic patterns and thetype, number and location of competing restaurants. For example, if prevailing health or dietarypreferences cause consumers to avoid pizza and other products we offer, or quick service restaurantofferings generally, in favor of foods that are perceived as more healthy, our business andoperating results would be harmed"
14,RAVE,RAVE RESTAURANT GROUP INC,2006-10-10,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.     In addition to the other information contained in this report, the following risks may affectus. Among the risks are: (i) risks associated with our business, (ii) risks associated with ourcommon stock and (iii) risks associated with our industry. Our business, financial condition, cashflows or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.     Risks Associated with Ongoing Operations     As a result of losses in recent quarters, our financial condition has been materially weakenedand our liquidity has decreased.     We have incurred losses of $490,000, $601,000, $477,000, and $4,421,000 in the first, second,third, and fourth quarters, respectively, of the fiscal year ended June 25, 2006. As a result, ourfinancial condition has been materially weakened and our liquidity diminished, and we remainvulnerable both to unexpected events (such as a sudden spike in block cheese prices or fuel prices)and to general declines in our operating environment (such as that resulting from significantlyincreased competition).     We are in default under our loan agreement, which has reduced available borrowing capacityunder our revolving credit line and resulted in diminished liquidity.     Since September 2005 we have been in default of our loan agreement with Wells Fargo Bank foron-going violations of certain financial ratio covenants in the loan agreement. As a result, WellsFargo has reduced the availability of revolving credit loans under the loan agreement from$6,000,000 to $2,250,000. The reduction in available borrowing capacity may diminish our cash flowand liquidity positions and adversely affect our ability to (i) meet our new restaurant developmentgoals, and (ii) effectively address competitive challenges and adverse operating and economicconditions.     On August 14, 2006, we entered into a limited forbearance agreement, with Wells Fargo underwhich Wells Fargo agreed to forbear until October 1, 2006 from exercising its rights and remediesas a result of our existing defaults under the revolving credit loan agreement, provided that theaggregate principal amount of all such revolving credit loans does not exceed $2,250,000 at any onetime. Wells Fargo and we entered into the forbearance agreement to provide us with time to pursuediscussions with Wells Fargo regarding various possible options for refinancing our indebtednessand liabilities to Wells Fargo under the revolving credit loan agreement. The limited forbearanceagreement has not been extended beyond October 1, 2006.8Table of Contents     Our substantial indebtedness could materially adversely affect our business and limit ourability to plan for or respond to changes in our business.     As of September 20, 2006, our consolidated long-term indebtedness was $7.9 million, the fullamount of which has been reclassified on our balance sheet as current debt since December 25, 2005as a result of our on-going loan default. Our indebtedness and the fact that a portion of ourreduced cash flow from operations must be used to make principal and interest payments on ourindebtedness could have important consequences to us. For example, they could:  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our loan agreement;   increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;   reduce the availability of our cash flow for other purposes;   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and theindustry in which we operate, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared toour competitors that may have less debt; and   limit, by the financial and other restrictive covenants in our loan agreement, ourability to borrow additional funds.     Payments we are required to make under a settlement agreement with our former president andchief executive officer could result in diminished liquidity and cash flow positions.     On September 24, 2006, we entered into a settlement agreement with Ronald W. Parker, ourformer president and chief executive officer, relating to the arbitration actions filed by theCompany and Mr. Parker in January 2005. Under the settlement agreement, we are obligated to payMr. Parker $2.8 million through a structured payment schedule beginning on the date of thesettlement with the final payment of $2.05 million to be paid within 180 days of the date of thesettlement. All payments under the settlement agreement would automatically and immediately becomedue and payable upon any sale lease-back transaction involving our corporate headquarters officeand distribution facilities. These payments will reduce the availability of our cash flow forother purposes, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business andindustry, and alter or postpone implementation of our growth strategy. We expect to be able tofund the payments under the settlement agreement by utilizing available equity in our corporateheadquarters office and distribution facilities to refinance existing mortgage debt on thatproperty and/or engage in a sale lease-back transaction for that property. We may not be able torealize sufficient value from our real estate assets or otherwise be able to fund the paymentsunder the settlement agreement. If we are not able to fund the payments under the settlementagreement or obtain financing, or enter into a sale lease-back transaction, on terms reasonablysatisfactory to us, then our liquidity, financial condition, business, and results of operationsmay be materially adversely affected.     If we do not prevail in litigation with a former beverage supplier, we could be liable forsignificant monetary damages.     An adverse outcome in our litigation with PepsiCo, Inc. could result in a liability ofapproximately $2.6 million, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity, financialposition and results of operation. No accrual for any amount of potential liability for thismatter has been made as of June 25, 2006.     We also face risks of litigation from customers, franchisees, employees and others in theordinary course of business, which diverts our financial and management resources. Any adverselitigation or publicity may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.     Claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the foodservice industry. In addition to decreasing our sales and profitability and diverting ourmanagement resources, adverse publicity or a substantial judgment against us could negativelyimpact our financial condition, results of operations and brand reputation, hindering our abilityto attract and retain franchisees and grow our business.     Further, we may be subject to employee, franchisee and other claims in the future based on,among other things, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and wage, rest break and mealbreak issues, including those relating to overtime compensation. If one or more of these claimswere to be successful or if there is a significant increase in the number of these claims, ourbusiness, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.9Table of Contents     If we are not able to implement our growth strategy successfully, which includes opening newdomestic Buffet Units and reimaging existing restaurants, our ability to increase our revenues andoperating profits could be materially adversely affected.     A significant component of our growth strategy for developing new domestic franchised andCompany-owned restaurants is the implementation of our new prototype Buffet Unit concept.
