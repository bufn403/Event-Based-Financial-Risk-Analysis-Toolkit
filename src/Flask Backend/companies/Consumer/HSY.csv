9,HSY,HERSHEY CO,2023-02-17,">Item 1A.    RISK FACTORSYou should carefully read the following discussion of significant factors, events and uncertainties when evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, these risk factors do not identify all the risks we face, and there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be significant that may have a material adverse effect on our business, performance or financial condition in the future.Risks Related to Our Business and OperationsOur Company’s reputation or brand image might be impacted as a result of issues or concerns relating to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging, human and workplace rights, and other environmental, social or governance matters, which in turn could result in litigation or otherwise negatively impact our operating results.In order to sell our iconic, branded products, we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers, consumers, suppliers, vendors and employees, among others.  Issues related to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our Company’s image and reputation.  We have in the past and may in the future need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption.  Negative publicity related to these types of concerns, or related to product contamination or product tampering, whether valid or not, could decrease demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.  In addition, negative publicity related to our environmental, social or governance practices could also impact our reputation with customers, consumers, suppliers and vendors.We have been in the past and in the future could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions as a result of issues or concerns relating to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging, human and workplace rights, and other environmental, social or governance matters, which could result in payments of fines or damages.  Costs associated with these potential actions, as well as the potential impact on our reputation or ability to sell our products, could negatively affect our operating results.  Disruption to our manufacturing operations or supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver finished products, resulting in a negative impact on our operating results.Approximately 70% of our manufacturing capacity is located in the United States.  Disruption to our global manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from, among other factors, the following:•Natural disaster;•Pandemic outbreak of disease (such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) global pandemic);•Climate change and severity of extreme weather;•Fire or explosion;•Terrorism or other acts of violence;•Labor strikes or other labor activities;•Unavailability of raw or packaging materials;•Operational and/or financial instability of key suppliers, and other vendors or service providers; and•Suboptimal production planning which could impact our ability to cost-effectively meet product demand.We believe that we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions.  We have strategies and plans in place to manage disruptive events if they were to occur, including our global supply chain strategies and our principle-based global labor relations strategy.  If we are unable, or find that it is not financially feasible, to effectively plan for, mitigate or manage operational stability and business resiliency, particularly within our international markets and snacks portfolio, due to the potential impacts of such disruptive events on our manufacturing operations or supply chain, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if such events were to occur.  Table of ContentsThe Hershey Company  |  2022 Form 10-K  |  Page 9We might not be able to hire, engage and retain the talented global human capital we need to drive our growth strategies.Our future success depends upon our ability to identify, hire, develop, engage and retain talented personnel across the globe. Competition for global talent is intense, and we might not be able to identify and hire the personnel we need to continue to evolve and grow our business. In particular, if we are unable to hire the right individuals to fill new or existing senior management positions as vacancies arise, our business performance may be impacted. Activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals require significant time and attention. We may also need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract talented new employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments.    In addition to hiring new employees, we must continue to focus on retaining and engaging the talented individuals we need to sustain our core business and lead our developing businesses into new markets, channels and categories. This may require significant investments in training, coaching and other career development and retention activities. If we are not able to effectively retain and grow our talent, our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely affected, which may impact our financial condition and results of operations.Risks associated with climate change and other environmental impacts, and increased focus and evolving views of our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders on climate change issues, could negatively affect our business and operations.Climate-related changes can increase variability in, or otherwise impact, natural disasters, including weather patterns, with the potential for increased frequency and severity of significant weather events, natural hazards, rising mean temperature and sea levels, and long-term changes in precipitation patterns. Climate change or weather-related disruptions to our supply chain can impact the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs.Increased focus on climate change has led to legislative and regulatory efforts to combat both potential causes and adverse impacts of climate change, including regulation of GHG emissions. New or increasing laws and regulations related to GHG emissions and other climate change related concerns may adversely affect us, our suppliers and our customers, and may require additional capital investments. Our value chain faces similar challenges as our products rely on agricultural ingredients and a global supply chain. Climate change poses a significant and increasing risk to global food production systems and to the safety and resilience of the communities where we live, work and source our ingredients. The GHG impacts of land-use change are most pronounced in our cocoa supply chain, where we have already been working for several years to prevent deforestation. Additionally, any non-compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements could negatively impact our reputation and ability to do business.Investors, customers, advisory services, government regulators and other market participants have increasingly focused on the environmental or sustainability practices of companies, including Hershey. Shareholders and financial institutions have increasingly evaluated a company’s ESG practices, disclosures and performance before making investments or other financial decisions. We believe our practices, disclosures and performance are strong and growing. However, if our environmental goals do not meet investor or other external stakeholder expectations and standards, our access to capital may be negatively impacted. An enforcement action could harm our reputation, financial position and ability to grow. A failure to meet expectations may adversely affect our results of operations, ability to manage our liquidity, or implement our strategies.The Company publishes its environmental goals, with a particular focus on achieving a 50% absolute reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and a 25% absolute reduction in our Scope 3 GHG emissions by 2030 (compared to a 2018 baseline), as well as having 100% of plastic packaging be reusable, recyclable or compostable and 25 million pounds of packaging be eliminated by 2030. The costs of these voluntary commitments may be greater than expected, and there can be no assurance the Company will achieve its goals, or meet the evolving sustainability expectations and standards of our investors or other external stakeholders. Any failure to achieve our goals, a perception of our failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment, or failure to respond to new or evolving legal and regulatory requirements or other sustainability concerns could adversely affect our business, reputation and increase risk of litigation. Table of ContentsThe Hershey Company  |  2022 Form 10-K  |  Page 10The effects and costs of climate change, or any failure to meet related requirements and expectations, could have a negative impact on our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.Risks Related to the Industry in Which We OperateIncreases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results. We use many different commodities for our business, including cocoa products, sugar, corn products, dairy products, wheat products, peanuts, almonds, natural gas and diesel fuel. Commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors, including: •Commodity market fluctuations;•Currency exchanges rates;•Imbalances between supply and demand;•Rising levels of inflation and interest rates related to domestic and global economic conditions or supply chain issues;•The effects of climate change and extreme weather on crop yield and quality;•Speculative influences;•Trade agreements among producing and consuming nations;•Supplier compliance with commitments;•Import/export requirements for raw materials and finished goods;•Political unrest in producing countries;•Introduction of living income premiums or similar requirements;•Changes in governmental agricultural programs and energy policies; and•Other events beyond our control such as the impacts on the business or supply chain arising from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.Although we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices, commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs.  If we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity. We may be able to pass some or all raw material, energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products; however, higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume and/or consumption.  If we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes (including if inflation outpaces our pricing elasticity) sufficiently, or in a timely manner, to offset increased raw material, energy or other input costs, including packaging, freight, direct labor, overhead and employee benefits, or if our sales volume decreases significantly, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  Market demand for new and existing products could decline. We operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products.  To generate revenues and profits, we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers.  Our continued success is impacted by many factors, including the following:•Effective retail execution;•Appropriate advertising campaigns and marketing programs;•Our ability to secure adequate shelf space at retail locations;•Our ability to drive sustainable innovation and maintain a strong pipeline of new products in the confectionery and broader snacking categories;•Changes in product category consumption;•Our response to consumer demographics and trends, including but not limited to, trends relating to store trips and the impact of the growing digital commerce channel; andTable of ContentsThe Hershey Company  |  2022 Form 10-K  |  Page 11•Consumer health concerns, including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients.There continues to be competitive product and pricing pressures in the markets where we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins.  We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including retailers and distributors, to compete effectively.  Our largest customer, McLane Company, Inc., accounted for approximately 28% of our total net sales in 2022.  McLane Company, Inc. is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Increased marketplace competition could hurt our business. The global confectionery and snacks packaged goods industry is intensely competitive and consolidation in this industry continues.  Some of our competitors are large companies that have significant resources and substantial international operations.  We continue to experience increased levels of in-store activity for other snack items, which has pressured confectionery category growth.  In order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment, we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising, and must continue to introduce and establish new products.  Due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance, increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits.  In addition, we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment. Risks Related to Strategic InitiativesOur financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures.From time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives.  The success of such activity depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable buyers, sellers or business partners; perform effective assessments prior to contract execution; negotiate contract terms; and, if applicable, obtain government approval.  These activities may present certain financial, managerial, staffing and talent, and operational risks, including diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses; difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations; and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made.  If the acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.In 2021, we successfully completed the divestiture of LSFC as we better prioritize resources against assets and brands that fit our business model and scale capabilities. Additionally, we completed the acquisitions of Lily’s in June 2021 and Dot’s and Pretzels in December 2021.  While we believe significant operating synergies can be obtained in connection with these acquisitions, achievement of these synergies will be driven by our ability to successfully leverage Hershey’s resources, expertise, capability-building, distribution locations and customer base.  In addition, the acquisitions of Dot’s and Pretzels are important steps in our journey to expand our breadth in snacking, as they should enable us to bring scale and category management capabilities to a key sub-segment of the warehouse snack aisle. If we are unable to successfully couple Hershey’s scale and expertise in brand building with Lily’s, Dot’s and Pretzels’ existing operations, it may impact our ability to expand our snacking footprint at our desired pace.Table of ContentsThe Hershey Company  |  2022 Form 10-K  |  Page 12Our international operations may not achieve projected growth objectives, which could adversely impact our overall business and results of operations. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, we derived approximately 12.5%, 13.0% and 13.6% of our net sales from customers located outside of the United States.  Additionally, approximately 18% of our total long-lived assets were located outside of the United States as of December 31, 2022.  As part of our strategy, we have made investments outside of the United States, particularly in Canada, Malaysia, Mexico, Brazil and India.  As a result, we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including:•The inability to manage operational stability and business resiliency within our international markets due to unforeseen global economic and environmental changes resulting in business interruption, supply constraints, inflation, deflation or decreased demand;•The inability to establish, develop and achieve market acceptance of our global brands in international markets;•Difficulties and costs associated with compliance and enforcement of remedies under a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and regulations;•Unexpected changes in regulatory environments;•Political and economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, terrorism, mass violence or armed conflict;•Nationalization of our properties by foreign governments;•Tax rates that may exceed those in the United States and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation;•Potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;•The imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;•Increased costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation;•The impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies;•Failure to gain sufficient profitable scale in certain international markets resulting in an inability to cover manufacturing fixed costs or resulting in losses from impairment or sale of assets; and•Failure to recruit, retain and build a talented and engaged global workforce.If we are not able to achieve our projected international growth objectives and mitigate the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.We may not fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies associated with our strategic initiatives or restructuring programs, which may have an adverse impact on our business.We depend on our ability to evolve and grow, and as changes in our business environment occur, we may adjust our business plans by introducing new strategic initiatives or restructuring programs to meet these changes. Recently introduced strategic initiatives include our efforts to continue to expand our presence in digital commerce, to transform our manufacturing, commercial and corporate operations through digital technologies and to enhance our data analytics capabilities to develop new commercial insights.  If we are not able to capture our share of the expanding digital commerce market, if we do not adequately leverage technology to improve operating efficiencies or if we are unable to develop the data analytics capabilities needed to generate actionable commercial insights, our business performance may be impacted, which may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.Additionally, from time to time we implement business realignment activities to support key strategic initiatives designed to maintain long-term sustainable growth, such as the International Optimization Program, which we commenced in the fourth quarter of 2020. This program is intended to increase our operating effectiveness and efficiency, to reduce our costs and/or to generate savings that can be reinvested in other areas of our business. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives and restructuring programs, that we will achieve or sustain the intended benefits under these programs, or that the benefits, even if achieved, will be adequate to meet our long-term growth and profitability expectations, which could in turn adversely affect our business.Table of ContentsThe Hershey Company  |  2022 Form 10-K  |  Page 13Risks Related to Governmental and Regulatory ChangesChanges in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products. Changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment.  These negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws, laws related to advertising and marketing practices, accounting standards, taxation compliance and requirements, competition laws, employment laws, import/export requirements and environmental laws, among others.  It is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Political, economic and/or financial market conditions, including impacts on our business arising from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, could negatively impact our financial results.Our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases, which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions, consumer confidence, employment levels, the availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit, consumer debt levels, energy costs and other factors.  Volatility in food and energy costs, sustained global recessions, broad political instability, rising unemployment, pandemic outbreak of disease (such as COVID-19), climate change, weather, natural and other disasters and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues, profitability and financial condition.Changes in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms, which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our Company, our customers and our suppliers.  A significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service providers, resulting in disruption to our supply chain and/or higher costs, and could impact our customers, resulting in a reduction in our revenue, or a possible increase in bad debt expense.Additionally, in February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine and this conflict is still ongoing. In response, the U.S. and other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia and may impose further sanctions that could damage or disrupt international commerce and the global economy. With respect to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the situation remains dynamic and subject to rapid and possibly material change. The Company’s efforts to manage and mitigate any direct or indirect effects from this conflict may ultimately be unsuccessful, and the effectiveness of these efforts depends on factors beyond our control, including the duration of the conflict and potential governmental actions. The potential effects of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine may also impact many of the other risk factors described herein.Risks Related to Digital Transformation, Cybersecurity and Data PrivacyDisruptions, failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations.Information technology is critically important to our business operations.  We use information technology to manage all business processes including manufacturing, financial, logistics, sales, marketing and administrative functions.  These processes collect, interpret and distribute business data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, customers and other third parties.We are regularly the target of cyber, ransomware and other security threats.  Therefore, we continuously monitor and update our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. We invest in industry standard security technology to protect the Company’s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack.  Our data security management program includes identity, trust, vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies.  We measure our data security effectiveness through industry-accepted methods and remediate significant findings.  Additionally, we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards.  We maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery, along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third party as part of our business resiliency preparedness.  We also have processes in place to prevent disruptions resulting from our implementation of new software and systems.Table of ContentsThe Hershey Company  |  2022 Form 10-K  |  Page 14While we have been subject to cyber attacks, ransomware and other security breaches, these incidents did not have a significant impact on our business operations. We believe our security technology tools and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security and data breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks. Nevertheless, despite continued vigilance in these areas, disruptions in or failures of information technology systems are possible and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation.  Failure of our systems, including failures due to cyber attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended, could cause transaction errors, loss of customers and sales, and could have negative consequences to our Company, our employees and those with whom we do business. This in turn could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results or operations. In addition, the cost to remediate any damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyber attack could be significant.Complications with the design or implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system could adversely impact our business and operations.We rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results.  We are in the process of a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. This ERP system will replace our existing operating and financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company’s financial records, enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to the Company’s management team related to the operation of the business. The ERP system implementation process has required, and will continue to require, the investment of significant personnel and financial resources. We may not be able to successfully implement the ERP system without experiencing further delays, increased costs and other difficulties. If we are unable to successfully design and implement the new ERP system as planned, our financial positions, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned or the ERP system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess those controls adequately could be further delayed"

The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, these risk factors do not identify all the risks we face, and there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be significant that may have a material adverse effect on our business, performance or financial condition in the future.Risks Related to Macroeconomic ConditionsOur business and financial results may be negatively impacted by the failure to successfully manage a disruption in consumer and trade patterns, as well as operational challenges associated with the actual or perceived effects of a disease outbreak, including epidemics, pandemics or similar widespread public health concerns, such as the current coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) global pandemic.Our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels, impulse purchases, the availability of our products at retail and our ability to manufacture, store and distribute products to our customers and consumers in an effective and efficient manner. The fear of exposure to or actual effects of a disease outbreak, epidemic, pandemic or similar widespread public health concern, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can negatively impact our overall business and financial results. Specific factors that may impact our operations, some of which have had an unfavorable impact on our operations as a result of COVID-19, include, but are not limited to:•Significant reductions or volatility in demand for one or more of our products, which may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship, shifts in demand away from one or more of our products, or pantry-loading activity; if prolonged, such impacts may further increase the difficulty of planning for operations and may negatively impact our results;•Significant reductions in the availability of one or more of our products as a result of retailers, common carriers or other shippers modifying restocking, fulfillment and shipping practices;•The inability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing operations or supply arrangements caused by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or finished product components, transportation resources, workforce availability, or other manufacturing and distribution capability;•The inability to effectively manage evolving health and welfare strategies, including but not limited to ongoing or not yet fully known costs related to operational adjustments to ensure continued employee and consumer safety and adherence to health guidelines as they are modified and supplemented;•An inability to effectively modify our trade promotion and advertising activities to reflect changing consumer viewing and shopping habits due to the cancellation or postponement of major sporting and entertainment events, reduced in-store visits, travel restrictions and a shift in customer advertising priorities, among other things;•The failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who supply our ingredients, packaging, capital equipment and other necessary operating materials, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, commercial banks and external business partners, to meet their obligations to the Company, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties and may negatively impact our operations; or•Significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, including quarantines, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers, or customers from sufficiently Table of ContentsThe Hershey Company  |  2021 Form 10-K  |  Page 9staffing operations, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, sale, and support of our products, which could negatively impact our results.With respect to COVID-19, the situation remains dynamic and subject to rapid and possibly material change. The Company’s efforts to manage and mitigate these factors may ultimately be unsuccessful, and the effectiveness of these efforts depends on factors beyond our control, including the duration and severity of any disease outbreak, as well as third-party actions taken in response.Risks Related to Our Business and OperationsOur Company’s reputation or brand image might be impacted as a result of issues or concerns relating to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging, human and workplace rights, and other environmental, social or governance matters, which in turn could result in litigation or otherwise negatively impact our operating results.In order to sell our iconic, branded products, we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers, consumers, suppliers, vendors and employees, among others.

We may be able to pass some or all raw material, energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products; however, higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume and/or consumption.  If we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes (including if inflation outpaces our pricing elasticity) sufficiently, or in a timely manner, to offset increased raw material, energy or other input costs, including packaging, freight, direct labor, overhead and employee benefits, or if our sales volume decreases significantly, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  Market demand for new and existing products could decline. We operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products.  To generate revenues and profits, we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers.  Our continued success is impacted by many factors, including the following:•Effective retail execution;•Appropriate advertising campaigns and marketing programs;•Our ability to secure adequate shelf space at retail locations;•Our ability to drive sustainable innovation and maintain a strong pipeline of new products in the confectionery and broader snacking categories;•Changes in product category consumption;•Our response to consumer demographics and trends, including but not limited to, trends relating to store trips and the impact of the growing digital commerce channel; and•Consumer health concerns, including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients.Table of ContentsThe Hershey Company  |  2021 Form 10-K  |  Page 12There continues to be competitive product and pricing pressures in the markets where we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins.  We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including retailers and distributors, to compete effectively.  Our largest customer, McLane Company, Inc., accounted for approximately 30% of our total net sales in 2021.  McLane Company, Inc. is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Increased marketplace competition could hurt our business. The global confectionery and snacks packaged goods industry is intensely competitive and consolidation in this industry continues.  Some of our competitors are large companies that have significant resources and substantial international operations.  We continue to experience increased levels of in-store activity for other snack items, which has pressured confectionery category growth.  In order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment, we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising, and must continue to introduce and establish new products.  Due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance, increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits.  In addition, we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment. Risks Related to Strategic InitiativesOur financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures.From time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives.  The success of such activity depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable buyers, sellers or business partners; perform effective assessments prior to contract execution; negotiate contract terms; and, if applicable, obtain government approval.  These activities may present certain financial, managerial, staffing and talent, and operational risks, including diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses; difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations; and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made.  If the acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.In 2021, we successfully completed the divestiture of LSFC as we better prioritize resources against assets and brands that fit our business model and scale capabilities. Additionally, we completed the acquisitions of Lily’s in June 2021 and Dot’s and Pretzels in December 2021.  While we believe significant operating synergies can be obtained in connection with these acquisitions, achievement of these synergies will be driven by our ability to successfully leverage Hershey’s resources, expertise, capability-building, distribution locations and customer base.  In addition, the acquisitions of Dot’s and Pretzels are important steps in our journey to expand our breadth in snacking, as they should enable us to bring scale and category management capabilities to a key sub-segment of the warehouse snack aisle. If we are unable to successfully couple Hershey’s scale and expertise in brand building with Lily’s, Dot’s and Pretzels’ existing operations, it may impact our ability to expand our snacking footprint at our desired pace.Table of ContentsThe Hershey Company  |  2021 Form 10-K  |  Page 13Our international operations may not achieve projected growth objectives, which could adversely impact our overall business and results of operations. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, we derived approximately 13.0%, 13.6% and 15.8% of our net sales from customers located outside of the United States.  Additionally, approximately 19% of our total long-lived assets were located outside of the United States as of December 31, 2021.  As part of our strategy, we have made investments outside of the United States, particularly in Canada, Malaysia, Mexico, Brazil and India.  As a result, we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including:•The inability to manage operational stability and business resiliency within our international markets due to unforeseen global economic and environmental changes resulting in business interruption, supply constraints, inflation, deflation or decreased demand;•The inability to establish, develop and achieve market acceptance of our global brands in international markets;•Difficulties and costs associated with compliance and enforcement of remedies under a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and regulations;•Unexpected changes in regulatory environments;•Political and economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, terrorism, mass violence or armed conflict;•Nationalization of our properties by foreign governments;•Tax rates that may exceed those in the United States and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation;•Potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;•The imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;•Increased costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation;•The impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies;•Failure to gain sufficient profitable scale in certain international markets resulting in an inability to cover manufacturing fixed costs or resulting in losses from impairment or sale of assets; and•Failure to recruit, retain and build a talented and engaged global workforce.If we are not able to achieve our projected international growth objectives and mitigate the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.We may not fully realize the expected costs savings and/or operating efficiencies associated with our strategic initiatives or restructuring programs, which may have an adverse impact on our business.We depend on our ability to evolve and grow, and as changes in our business environment occur, we may adjust our business plans by introducing new strategic initiatives or restructuring programs to meet these changes. Recently introduced strategic initiatives include our efforts to continue to expand our presence in digital commerce, to transform our manufacturing, commercial and corporate operations through digital technologies and to enhance our data analytics capabilities to develop new commercial insights.  If we are not able to capture our share of the expanding digital commerce market, if we do not adequately leverage technology to improve operating efficiencies or if we are unable to develop the data analytics capabilities needed to generate actionable commercial insights, our business performance may be impacted, which may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.Additionally, from time to time we implement business realignment activities to support key strategic initiatives designed to maintain long-term sustainable growth, such as the International Optimization Program, which we commenced in the fourth quarter of 2020. This program is intended to increase our operating effectiveness and efficiency, to reduce our costs and/or to generate savings that can be reinvested in other areas of our business. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives and restructuring programs, that we will achieve or sustain the intended benefits under these programs, or that the benefits, even if achieved, will be adequate to meet our long-term growth and profitability expectations, which could in turn adversely affect our business.Table of ContentsThe Hershey Company  |  2021 Form 10-K  |  Page 14Risks Related to Governmental and Regulatory ChangesChanges in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products. Changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment.  These negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws, laws related to advertising and marketing practices, accounting standards, taxation compliance and requirements, competition laws, employment laws, import/export requirements and environmental laws, among others.  It is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Political, economic and/or financial market conditions could negatively impact our financial results.Our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases, which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions, consumer confidence, employment levels, the availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit, consumer debt levels, energy costs and other factors.  Volatility in food and energy costs, sustained global recessions, broad political instability, rising unemployment, pandemic outbreak of disease, climate change, weather, natural and other disasters and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues, profitability and financial condition.Changes in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms, which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our Company, our customers and our suppliers.  A significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service providers, resulting in disruption to our supply chain and/or higher costs, and could impact our customers, resulting in a reduction in our revenue, or a possible increase in bad debt expense.Risks Related to Digital Transformation, Cybersecurity and Data PrivacyDisruptions, failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations.Information technology is critically important to our business operations.  We use information technology to manage all business processes including manufacturing, financial, logistics, sales, marketing and administrative functions.  These processes collect, interpret and distribute business data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, customers and others.  We are regularly the target of cyber and other security threats.  Therefore, we continuously monitor and update our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. We invest in industry standard security technology to protect the Company’s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack.  Our data security management program includes identity, trust, vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies.  We measure our data security effectiveness through industry-accepted methods and remediate significant findings.  Additionally, we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards.  We maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery, along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third party as part of our business resiliency preparedness.  We also have processes in place to prevent disruptions resulting from our implementation of new software and systems.While we have been subject to cyber attacks and other security breaches, these incidents did not have a significant impact on our business operations. We believe our security technology tools and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks. Nevertheless, despite continued vigilance in these areas, disruptions in or failures of information technology systems are possible and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation.  Failure of our systems, including failures due to cyber attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended, could cause transaction errors, loss of customers and sales, and could have negative consequences to our Company, our employees and those with whom we do business. This in turn could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results or operations. In addition, the cost to remediate any damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyber attack could be significant.Table of ContentsThe Hershey Company  |  2021 Form 10-K  |  Page 15Complications with the design or implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system could adversely impact our business and operations.We rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results.  We are in the process of a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. This ERP system will replace our existing operating and financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company’s financial records, enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to the Company’s management team related to the operation of the business. The ERP system implementation process has required, and will continue to require, the investment of significant personnel and financial resources. We may not be able to successfully implement the ERP system without experiencing further delays, increased costs and other difficulties. If we are unable to successfully design and implement the new ERP system as planned, our financial positions, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned or the ERP system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess those controls adequately could be further delayed"
8,HSY,HERSHEY CO,2021-02-17,">Item 1A.    RISK FACTORSYou should carefully read the following discussion of significant factors, events and uncertainties when evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, these risk factors do not identify all the risks we face, and there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be significant that may have a material adverse effect on our business, performance or financial condition in the future.Risk Related to Macroeconomic ConditionsOur business and financial results may be negatively impacted by the failure to successfully manage a disruption in consumer and trade patterns, as well as operational challenges associated with the actual or perceived effects of a disease outbreak, including epidemics, pandemics or similar widespread public health concerns, such as, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (""COVID-19"") global pandemic.Our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels, impulse purchases, the availability of our products at retail and our ability to manufacture, store and distribute products to our customers and consumers in an effective and efficient manner. The fear of exposure to or actual effects of a disease outbreak, epidemic, pandemic or similar widespread public health concern, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could negatively impact our overall business and financial results. Specific factors that may impact our operations, some of which have had an unfavorable impact on our operations as a result of COVID-19, include, but are not limited to:•Significant reductions or volatility in demand for one or more of our products, which may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship, shifts in demand away from one or more of our products, or pantry-loading activity; if prolonged, such impacts may further increase the difficulty of planning for operations and may negatively impact our results;•Significant reductions in the availability of one or more of our products as a result of retailers, common carriers or other shippers modifying restocking, fulfillment and shipping practices;•The inability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing operations or supply arrangements caused by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or finished product components, transportation resources, workforce availability, or other manufacturing and distribution capability;•The inability to effectively manage evolving health and welfare strategies, including but not limited to ongoing or not yet fully known costs related to operational adjustments to ensure continued employee and consumer safety and adherence to health guidelines as they are modified and supplemented;•An inability to effectively modify our trade promotion and advertising activities to reflect changing consumer viewing and shopping habits due to the cancellation or postponement of major sporting and entertainment events, reduced in-store visits, travel restrictions and a shift in customer advertising priorities, among other things;•The failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who supply our ingredients, packaging, capital equipment and other necessary operating materials, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, commercial banks and external business partners, to meet their obligations to the Company, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties and may negatively impact our operations; or•Significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, including quarantines, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers, or customers from sufficiently Table of ContentsThe Hershey Company  |  2020 Form 10-K  |  Page 8staffing operations, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, sale, and support of our products, which could negatively impact our results.With respect to COVID-19, the situation remains dynamic and subject to rapid and possibly material change. The Company's efforts to manage and mitigate these factors may be unsuccessful, and the effectiveness of these efforts depends on factors beyond our control, including the duration and severity of any disease outbreak, as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate public health effects.Risks Related to Our Business and OperationsOur Company’s reputation or brand image might be impacted as a result of issues or concerns relating to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging, human and workplace rights, and other environmental, social or governance matters, which in turn could result in litigation or otherwise negatively impact our operating results.In order to sell our iconic, branded products, we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers, consumers, suppliers, vendors and employees, among others.  Issues related to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our Company’s image and reputation.  We have in the past and may in the future need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption.  Negative publicity related to these types of concerns, or related to product contamination or product tampering, whether valid or not, could decrease demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.  In addition, negative publicity related to our environmental, social or governance practices could also impact our reputation with customers, consumers, suppliers and vendors.We have in the past and in the future could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions as a result of issues or concerns relating to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging, human and workplace rights, and other environmental, social or governance matters, which could result in payments of fines or damages.  Costs associated with these potential actions, as well as the potential impact on our reputation or ability to sell our products, could negatively affect our operating results.  Disruption to our manufacturing operations or supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver finished products, resulting in a negative impact on our operating results.Approximately 72% of our manufacturing capacity is located in the United States.  Disruption to our global manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from, among other factors, the following:•Natural disaster;•Pandemic outbreak of disease;•Climate change and severity of extreme weather;•Fire or explosion;•Terrorism or other acts of violence;•Labor strikes or other labor activities;•Unavailability of raw or packaging materials;•Operational and/or financial instability of key suppliers, and other vendors or service providers; and•Suboptimal production planning which could impact our ability to cost-effectively meet product demand.We believe that we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions.  We have strategies and plans in place to manage disruptive events if they were to occur, including our global supply chain strategies and our principle-based global labor relations strategy.  If we are unable, or find that it is not financially feasible, to effectively plan for, mitigate or manage operational stability and business resiliency, particularly within our international markets and snacks portfolio, due to the potential impacts of such disruptive events on our manufacturing operations or supply chain, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if such events were to occur.  Table of ContentsThe Hershey Company  |  2020 Form 10-K  |  Page 9We might not be able to hire, engage and retain the talented global workforce we need to drive our growth strategies.Our future success depends upon our ability to identify, hire, develop, engage and retain talented personnel across the globe. Competition for global talent is intense, and we might not be able to identify and hire the personnel we need to continue to evolve and grow our business. In particular, if we are unable to hire the right individuals to fill new or existing senior management positions as vacancies arise, our business performance may be impacted. Activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals require significant time and attention. We may also need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract talented new employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments.    In addition to hiring new employees, we must continue to focus on retaining and engaging the talented individuals we need to sustain our core business and lead our developing businesses into new markets, channels and categories. This may require significant investments in training, coaching and other career development and retention activities. If we are not able to effectively retain and grow our talent, our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely affected, which may impact our financial condition and results of operations.Risks Related to the Industry in Which We OperateIncreases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results. We use many different commodities for our business, including cocoa products, sugar, corn products, dairy products, peanuts, almonds, natural gas and diesel fuel. Commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors, including: •Commodity market fluctuations;•Currency exchanges rates;•Imbalances between supply and demand;•The effects of climate change and extreme weather on crop yield and quality;•Speculative influences;•Trade agreements among producing and consuming nations;•Supplier compliance with commitments;•Import/export requirements for raw materials and finished goods;•Political unrest in producing countries;•Introduction of living income premiums or similar requirements; and•Changes in governmental agricultural programs and energy policies.Although we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices, commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs.  If we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity. We may be able to pass some or all raw material, energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products; however, higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume and/or consumption.  If we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently, or in a timely manner, to offset increased raw material, energy or other input costs, including packaging, freight, direct labor, overhead and employee benefits, or if our sales volume decreases significantly, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  Table of ContentsThe Hershey Company  |  2020 Form 10-K  |  Page 10Market demand for new and existing products could decline. We operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products.  To generate revenues and profits, we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers.  Our continued success is impacted by many factors, including the following:•Effective retail execution;•Appropriate advertising campaigns and marketing programs;•Our ability to secure adequate shelf space at retail locations;•Our ability to drive sustainable innovation and maintain a strong pipeline of new products in the confectionery and broader snacking categories;•Changes in product category consumption;•Our response to consumer demographics and trends, including but not limited to, trends relating to store trips and the impact of the growing digital commerce channel; and•Consumer health concerns, including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients.There continues to be competitive product and pricing pressures in the markets where we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins.  We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including retailers and distributors, to compete effectively.  Our largest customer, McLane Company, Inc., accounted for approximately 31% of our total net sales in 2020.  McLane Company, Inc. is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Increased marketplace competition could hurt our business. The global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive and consolidation in this industry continues.  Some of our competitors are large companies that have significant resources and substantial international operations.  We continue to experience increased levels of in-store activity for other snack items, which has pressured confectionery category growth.  In order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment, we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising, and must continue to introduce and establish new products.  Due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance, increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits.  In addition, we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment. Risks Related to Strategic InitiativesOur financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures.From time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives.  The success of such activity depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable buyers, sellers or business partners; perform effective assessments prior to contract execution; negotiate contract terms; and, if applicable, obtain government approval.  These activities may present certain financial, managerial, staffing and talent, and operational risks, including diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses; difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations; and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made.  If the acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Table of ContentsThe Hershey Company  |  2020 Form 10-K  |  Page 11In 2020, we successfully completed the divestitures of Krave and the Scharffen Berger and Dagoba brands as we better prioritize resources against assets and brands that fit our business model and scale capabilities. Additionally, over the last several years, we have continued to invest in our snacks portfolio, specifically with the acquisitions of ONE Brands, LLC in September 2019, Pirate Brands in October 2018 and Amplify Snack Brands, Inc. in January 2018, respectively.  While we believe significant operating synergies can be obtained in connection with these acquisitions, achievement of these synergies will be driven by our ability to successfully leverage Hershey's resources, expertise, capability-building, distribution locations and customer base.  In addition, these acquisitions are important steps in our journey to expand our breadth in snacking, as they should enable us to bring scale and category management capabilities to a key sub-segment of the warehouse snack aisle. If we are unable to successfully couple Hershey’s scale and expertise in brand building with ONE Brands, Pirate Brands and Amplify's existing operations, it may impact our ability to expand our snacking footprint at our desired pace.Our international operations may not achieve projected growth objectives, which could adversely impact our overall business and results of operations. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, we derived approximately 13.6%, 15.8% and 16.1% of our net sales from customers located outside of the United States.  Additionally, approximately 20% of our total long-lived assets were located outside of the United States as of December 31, 2020.  As part of our strategy, we have made investments outside of the United States, particularly in Canada, Malaysia, Mexico, Brazil and India.  As a result, we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including:•The inability to manage operational stability and business resiliency within our international markets due to unforeseen global economic and environmental changes resulting in business interruption, supply constraints, inflation, deflation or decreased demand;•The inability to establish, develop and achieve market acceptance of our global brands in international markets;•Difficulties and costs associated with compliance and enforcement of remedies under a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and regulations;•Unexpected changes in regulatory environments;•Political and economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, terrorism, mass violence or armed conflict;•Nationalization of our properties by foreign governments;•Tax rates that may exceed those in the United States and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation;•Potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;•The imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;•Increased costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation;•The impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies;•Failure to gain sufficient profitable scale in certain international markets resulting in an inability to cover manufacturing fixed costs or resulting in losses from impairment or sale of assets; and•Failure to recruit, retain and build a talented and engaged global workforce.If we are not able to achieve our projected international growth objectives and mitigate the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Table of ContentsThe Hershey Company  |  2020 Form 10-K  |  Page 12We may not fully realize the expected costs savings and/or operating efficiencies associated with our strategic initiatives or restructuring programs, which may have an adverse impact on our business.We depend on our ability to evolve and grow, and as changes in our business environment occur, we may adjust our business plans by introducing new strategic initiatives or restructuring programs to meet these changes.

These programs are intended to increase our operating effectiveness and efficiency, to reduce our costs and/or to generate savings that can be reinvested in other areas of our business. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives and restructuring programs, that we will achieve or sustain the intended benefits under these programs, or that the benefits, even if achieved, will be adequate to meet our long-term growth and profitability expectations, which could in turn adversely affect our business.Risks Related to Governmental and Regulatory ChangesChanges in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products. Changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment.  These negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws, laws related to advertising and marketing practices, accounting standards, taxation requirements, competition laws, employment laws, import/export requirements and environmental laws, among others.  It is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Political, economic and/or financial market conditions could negatively impact our financial results.Our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases, which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions, consumer confidence, employment levels, the availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit, consumer debt levels, energy costs and other factors.  Volatility in food and energy costs, sustained global recessions, broad political instability, rising unemployment, pandemic outbreak of disease, climate change, weather, natural and other disasters and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues, profitability and financial condition.Changes in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms, which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our Company, our customers and our suppliers.  A significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service providers, resulting in disruption to our supply chain and/or higher costs, and could impact our customers, resulting in a reduction in our revenue, or a possible increase in bad debt expense.Table of ContentsThe Hershey Company  |  2020 Form 10-K  |  Page 13Risks Related to Digital Transformation, Cybersecurity and Data PrivacyDisruptions, failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations.Information technology is critically important to our business operations.

We may not be able to successfully implement the ERP system without experiencing further delays, increased costs and other difficulties. We selectively paused certain aspects of the ERP system implementation due to resource constraints and challenges associated with the critical design phase during these uncertain times. We expect this to delay our overall ERP implementation by approximately one year. If we are unable to successfully design and implement the new ERP system as planned, our financial positions, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned or the ERP system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess those controls adequately could be further delayed"
16,HSY,HERSHEY CO,2020-02-20,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORSCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the exhibits hereto and the information incorporated by reference herein, contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Other than statements of historical fact, information regarding activities, events and developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future, including, but not limited to, information relating to our future growth and profitability targets and strategies designed to increase total shareholder value, are forward-looking statements based on management’s estimates, assumptions and projections.  Forward-looking statements also include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future economic and financial condition and results of operations, the plans and objectives of management and our assumptions regarding our performance and such plans and objectives.  Many of the forward-looking statements contained in this document may be identified by the use of words such as “intend,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “should,” “planned,” “projected,” “estimated” and “potential,” among others. Forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are predictions only and actual results could differ materially from management’s expectations due to a variety of factors, including those described below.  All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons working on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such risk factors.  The forward-looking statements that we make in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on management’s current views and assumptions regarding future events and speak only as of their dates. We assume no obligation to update developments of these risk factors or to announce publicly any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements that we make, or to make corrections to reflect future events or developments, except as required by the federal securities laws.Our Company’s reputation or brand image might be impacted as a result of issues or concerns relating to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging, human and workplace rights, and other environmental, social or governance matters, which in turn could negatively impact our operating results.In order to sell our iconic, branded products, we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers, consumers, suppliers, vendors and employees, among others.  Issues related to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our Company’s image and reputation.  Negative publicity related to these types of concerns, or related to product contamination or product tampering, whether valid or not, could decrease demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.  We may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption, and we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions, which could result in payments of fines or damages.  In addition, negative publicity related to our environmental, social or governance practices could also impact our reputation with customers, consumers, suppliers and vendors.  Costs associated with these potential actions, as well as the potential impact on our ability to sell our products, could negatively affect our operating results.  The Hershey Company |  2019 Form 10-K  |  Page 6Increases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results. We use many different commodities for our business, including cocoa products, sugar, corn products, dairy products, peanuts, almonds, natural gas and diesel fuel. Commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors, including: •Commodity market fluctuations;•Currency exchanges rates;•Imbalances between supply and demand;•The effect of weather on crop yield and quality;•Speculative influences;•Trade agreements among producing and consuming nations;•Supplier compliance with commitments;•Import/export requirements for raw materials and finished goods;•Political unrest in producing countries; and•Changes in governmental agricultural programs and energy policies.Although we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices, commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs.  If we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity. We may be able to pass some or all raw material, energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products; however, higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume and/or consumption.  If we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently, or in a timely manner, to offset increased raw material, energy or other input costs, including packaging, freight, direct labor, overhead and employee benefits, or if our sales volume decreases significantly, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  Market demand for new and existing products could decline. We operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products.  To generate revenues and profits, we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers.  Our continued success is impacted by many factors, including the following:•Effective retail execution;•Appropriate advertising campaigns and marketing programs;•Our ability to secure adequate shelf space at retail locations;•Our ability to drive sustainable innovation and maintain a strong pipeline of new products in the confectionery and broader snacking categories;•Changes in product category consumption;•Our response to consumer demographics and trends, including but not limited to, trends relating to store trips and the impact of the growing digital commerce channel; and•Consumer health concerns, including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients.There continues to be competitive product and pricing pressures in the markets where we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins.  We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including retailers and distributors, to compete effectively.  Our largest customer, McLane Company, Inc., accounted for approximately 30% of our total net sales in 2019.  McLane Company, Inc. is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. The Hershey Company |  2019 Form 10-K  |  Page 7Increased marketplace competition could hurt our business. The global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive and consolidation in this industry continues.  Some of our competitors are large companies that have significant resources and substantial international operations.  We continue to experience increased levels of in-store activity for other snack items, which has pressured confectionery category growth.  In order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment, we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising, and must continue to introduce and establish new products.  Due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance, increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits.  In addition, we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment. Disruption to our manufacturing operations or supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver finished products, resulting in a negative impact on our operating results.Approximately 70% of our manufacturing capacity is located in the United States.  Disruption to our global manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from, among other factors, the following:•Natural disaster;•Pandemic outbreak of disease;•Weather;•Fire or explosion;•Terrorism or other acts of violence;•Labor strikes or other labor activities;•Unavailability of raw or packaging materials;•Operational and/or financial instability of key suppliers, and other vendors or service providers; and•Suboptimal production planning which could impact our ability to cost-effectively meet product demand.We believe that we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions.  We have strategies and plans in place to manage disruptive events if they were to occur, including our global supply chain strategies and our principle-based global labor relations strategy.  If we are unable, or find that it is not financially feasible, to effectively plan for or mitigate the potential impacts of such disruptive events on our manufacturing operations or supply chain, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if such events were to occur.  Our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures.From time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives.  The success of such activity depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable buyers, sellers or business partners; perform effective assessments prior to contract execution; negotiate contract terms; and, if applicable, obtain government approval.  These activities may present certain financial, managerial, staffing and talent, and operational risks, including diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses; difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations; and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made.  If the acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We completed the acquisitions of ONE Brands, LLC in September 2019, Pirate Brands in October 2018 and Amplify Snack Brands, Inc. in January 2018, respectively.  While we believe significant operating synergies can be obtained in connection with these acquisitions, achievement of these synergies will be driven by our ability to successfully leverage Hershey's resources, expertise, capability-building, distribution locations and customer base.  In addition, these acquisitions are important steps in our journey to expand our breadth in snacking, as they should enable us to bring scale and category management capabilities to a key sub-segment of the warehouse snack aisle. If we are unable to successfully couple Hershey’s scale and expertise in brand building with ONE Brands, Pirate Brands and Amplify's existing operations, it may impact our ability to expand our snacking footprint at our desired pace.The Hershey Company |  2019 Form 10-K  |  Page 8Changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products. Changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment.  These negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws, laws related to advertising and marketing practices, accounting standards, taxation requirements, competition laws, employment laws, import/export requirements and environmental laws, among others.  It is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Political, economic and/or financial market conditions could negatively impact our financial results.Our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions, consumer confidence, employment levels, the availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit, consumer debt levels, energy costs and other factors.  Volatility in food and energy costs, sustained global recessions, broad political instability, rising unemployment, pandemic outbreak of disease, weather, natural and other disasters and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues, profitability and financial condition.Changes in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms, which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our Company, our customers and our suppliers.  A significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service providers, resulting in disruption to our supply chain and/or higher costs, and could impact our customers, resulting in a reduction in our revenue, or a possible increase in bad debt expense.Our international operations may not achieve projected growth objectives, which could adversely impact our overall business and results of operations. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, we derived approximately 16%, 16% and 17% of our net sales from customers located outside of the United States.  Additionally, approximately 20% of our total long-lived assets were located outside of the United States as of December 31, 2019.  As part of our strategy, we have made investments outside of the United States, particularly in Canada, China, Malaysia, Mexico, Brazil and India.  As a result, we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including:•Unforeseen global economic and environmental changes resulting in business interruption, supply constraints, inflation, deflation or decreased demand;•Inability to establish, develop and achieve market acceptance of our global brands in international markets;•Difficulties and costs associated with compliance and enforcement of remedies under a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and regulations;•Unexpected changes in regulatory environments;•Political and economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, terrorism, mass violence or armed conflict;•Nationalization of our properties by foreign governments;•Tax rates that may exceed those in the United States and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation;•Potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;•The imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;•Increased costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation;•The impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies;•Failure to gain sufficient profitable scale in certain international markets resulting in an inability to cover manufacturing fixed costs or resulting in losses from impairment or sale of assets; and•Failure to recruit, retain and build a talented and engaged global workforce.If we are not able to achieve our projected international growth objectives and mitigate the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.The Hershey Company |  2019 Form 10-K  |  Page 9Disruptions, failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations.Information technology is critically important to our business operations.  We use information technology to manage all business processes including manufacturing, financial, logistics, sales, marketing and administrative functions.  These processes collect, interpret and distribute business data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, customers and others.  We are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats.  Therefore, we continuously monitor and update our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. We invest in industry standard security technology to protect the Company’s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack.  Our data security management program includes identity, trust, vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies.  We measure our data security effectiveness through industry accepted methods and remediate significant findings.  Additionally, we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards.  We maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery, along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third party as part of our business continuity preparedness.  We also have processes in place to prevent disruptions resulting from the implementation of new software and systems of the latest technology.While we have been subject to cyber attacks and other security breaches, these incidents did not have a significant impact on our business operations. We believe our security technology tools and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks. Nevertheless, despite continued vigilance in these areas, disruptions in or failures of information technology systems are possible and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation.  Failure of our systems, including failures due to cyber attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended, could cause transaction errors, loss of customers and sales, and could have negative consequences to our Company, our employees and those with whom we do business. This in turn could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results or operations. In addition, the cost to remediate any damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyber attack could be significant.We might not be able to hire, engage and retain the talented global workforce we need to drive our growth strategies.Our future success depends upon our ability to identify, hire, develop, engage and retain talented personnel across the globe. Competition for global talent is intense, and we might not be able to identify and hire the personnel we need to continue to evolve and grow our business. In particular, if we are unable to hire the right individuals to fill new or existing senior management positions as vacancies arise, our business performance may be impacted. Activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals require significant time and attention. We may also need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract talented new employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments.    In addition to hiring new employees, we must continue to focus on retaining and engaging the talented individuals we need to sustain our core business and lead our developing businesses into new markets, channels and categories. This may require significant investments in training, coaching and other career development and retention activities. If we are not able to effectively retain and grow our talent, our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely affected, which may impact our financial condition and results of operations.The Hershey Company |  2019 Form 10-K  |  Page 10We may not fully realize the expected costs savings and/or operating efficiencies associated with our strategic initiatives or restructuring programs, which may have an adverse impact on our business.We depend on our ability to evolve and grow, and as changes in our business environment occur, we may adjust our business plans by introducing new strategic initiatives or restructuring programs to meet these changes. Recently introduced strategic initiatives include our efforts to continue to expand our presence in digital commerce, to transform our manufacturing, commercial and corporate operations through digital technologies and to enhance our data analytics capabilities to develop new commercial insights.  If we are not able to capture our share of the expanding digital commerce market, if we do not adequately leverage technology to improve operating efficiencies or if we are unable to develop the data analytics capabilities needed to generate actionable commercial insights, our business performance may be impacted, which may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.Additionally, from time to time we implement business realignment activities to support key strategic initiatives designed to maintain long-term sustainable growth, such as the Margin for Growth Program we commenced in the first quarter of 2017. These programs are intended to increase our operating effectiveness and efficiency, to reduce our costs and/or to generate savings that can be reinvested in other areas of our business. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives and restructuring programs, that we will achieve or sustain the intended benefits under these programs, or that the benefits, even if achieved, will be adequate to meet our long-term growth and profitability expectations, which could in turn adversely affect our business.Complications with the design or implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system could adversely impact our business and operations.We rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results.  We are in the process of a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. This ERP system will replace our existing operating and financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company’s financial records, enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to the Company’s management team related to the operation of the business. The ERP system implementation process has required, and will continue to require, the investment of significant personnel and financial resources. We may not be able to successfully implement the ERP system without experiencing delays, increased costs and other difficulties. If we are unable to successfully design and implement the new ERP system as planned, our financial positions, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned or the ERP system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed"

In particular, if we are unable to hire the right individuals to fill new or existing senior management positions as vacancies arise, our business performance may be impacted. Activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals require significant time and attention. We may also need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract talented new employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments.    In addition to hiring new employees, we must continue to focus on retaining and engaging the talented individuals we need to sustain our core business and lead our developing businesses into new markets, channels and categories. This may require significant investments in training, coaching and other career development and retention activities. If we are not able to effectively retain and grow our talent, our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely affected, which may impact our financial condition and results of operations.We may not fully realize the expected costs savings and/or operating efficiencies associated with our strategic initiatives or restructuring programs, which may have an adverse impact on our business.We depend on our ability to evolve and grow, and as changes in our business environment occur, we may adjust our business plans by introducing new strategic initiatives or restructuring programs to meet these changes. Recently introduced strategic initiatives include our efforts to continue to expand our presence in digital commerce, to transform our manufacturing, commercial and corporate operations through digital technologies and to enhance our data analytics capabilities to develop new commercial insights.  If we are not able to capture our share of the expanding digital commerce market, if we do not adequately leverage technology to improve operating efficiencies or if we are unable to develop the data analytics capabilities needed to generate actionable commercial insights, our business performance may be impacted, which may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.Additionally, from time to time we implement business realignment activities to support key strategic initiatives designed to maintain long-term sustainable growth, such as the Margin for Growth Program we commenced in the first quarter of 2017. These programs are intended to increase our operating effectiveness and efficiency, to reduce our costs and/or to generate savings that can be reinvested in other areas of our business. We cannot guarantee that we will 10be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives and restructuring programs, that we will achieve or sustain the intended benefits under these programs, or that the benefits, even if achieved, will be adequate to meet our long-term growth and profitability expectations, which could in turn adversely affect our business.Complications with the design or implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system could adversely impact our business and operations.We rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results.  We are in the process of a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. This ERP system will replace our existing operating and financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company’s financial records, enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to the Company’s management team related to the operation of the business. The ERP system implementation process has required, and will continue to require, the investment of significant personnel and financial resources. We may not be able to successfully implement the ERP system without experiencing delays, increased costs and other difficulties. If we are unable to successfully design and implement the new ERP system as planned, our financial positions, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned or the ERP system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed"
3,HSY,HERSHEY CO,2018-02-27,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORS Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the exhibits hereto and the information incorporated by reference herein, contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Other than statements of historical fact, information regarding activities, events and developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future, including, but not limited to, information relating to our future growth and profitability targets and strategies designed to increase total shareholder value, are forward-looking statements based on management’s estimates, assumptions and projections.  Forward-looking statements also include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future economic and financial condition and results of operations, the plans and objectives of management and our assumptions regarding our performance and such plans and objectives.  Many of the forward-looking statements contained in this document may be identified by the use of words such as “intend,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “should,” “planned,” “projected,” “estimated” and “potential,” among others. Forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are predictions only and actual results could differ materially from management’s expectations due to a variety of factors, including those described below.  All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons working on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such risk factors.  The forward-looking statements that we make in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on management’s current views and assumptions regarding future events and speak only as of their dates. We assume no obligation to update developments of these risk factors or to announce publicly any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements that we make, or to make corrections to reflect future events or developments, except as required by the federal securities laws.Issues or concerns related to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall and/or result in harm to the Company’s reputation, negatively impacting our operating results.In order to sell our iconic, branded products, we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers and consumers.  Issues related to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our Company’s image and reputation.  Negative publicity related to these types of concerns, or related to product contamination or product tampering, whether valid or not, could decrease demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.  We may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption.  In addition, we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions, which could result in payments of fines or damages.  Costs associated with these potential actions could negatively affect our operating results.  Increases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results. We use many different commodities for our business, including cocoa products, sugar, dairy products, peanuts, almonds, corn sweeteners, natural gas and fuel oil. Commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors, including: Commodity market fluctuations;Currency exchange rates;Imbalances between supply and demand;The effect of weather on crop yield;Speculative influences;Trade agreements among producing and consuming nations;Supplier compliance with commitments;Political unrest in producing countries; andChanges in governmental agricultural programs and energy policies.6Although we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices, commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs.  If we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity. We may be able to pass some or all raw material, energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products; however, higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume and/or consumption.  If we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently, or in a timely manner, to offset increased raw material, energy or other input costs, including packaging, freight, direct labor, overhead and employee benefits, or if our sales volume decreases significantly, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  Market demand for new and existing products could decline. We operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products.  To generate revenues and profits, we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers.  Our continued success is impacted by many factors, including the following:Effective retail execution;Appropriate advertising campaigns and marketing programs;Our ability to secure adequate shelf space at retail locations;Our ability to drive sustainable innovation and maintain a strong pipeline of new products in the confectionery and broader snacking categories;Changes in product category consumption;Our response to consumer demographics and trends, including but not limited to, trends relating to store trips and the impact of the growing e-commerce channel; andConsumer health concerns, including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients.There continues to be competitive product and pricing pressures in the markets where we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins.  We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including retailers and distributors, to compete effectively.  Our largest customer, McLane Company, Inc., accounted for approximately 29% of our total net sales in 2017.  McLane Company, Inc. is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Increased marketplace competition could hurt our business. The global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive and consolidation in this industry continues.  Some of our competitors are large companies that have significant resources and substantial international operations.  We continue to experience increased levels of in-store activity for other snack items, which has pressured confectionery category growth.  In order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment, we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising, and must continue to introduce and establish new products.  Due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance, increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits.  In addition, we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment. 7Disruption to our manufacturing operations or supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver finished products, resulting in a negative impact on our operating results.Approximately 70% of our manufacturing capacity is located in the United States.  Disruption to our global manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from, among other factors, the following:Natural disaster;Pandemic outbreak of disease;Weather;Fire or explosion;Terrorism or other acts of violence;Labor strikes or other labor activities; Unavailability of raw or packaging materials; Operational and/or financial instability of key suppliers, and other vendors or service providers; andSuboptimal production planning which could impact our ability to cost-effectively meet product demand.We believe that we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions.  We have strategies and plans in place to manage disruptive events if they were to occur, including our global supply chain strategies and our principle-based global labor relations strategy.  If we are unable, or find that it is not financially feasible, to effectively plan for or mitigate the potential impacts of such disruptive events on our manufacturing operations or supply chain, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if such events were to occur.  Our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures.From time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives.  The success of such activity depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable buyers, sellers or business partners; perform effective assessments prior to contract execution; negotiate contract terms; and, if applicable, obtain government approval.  These activities may present certain financial, managerial, staffing and talent, and operational risks, including diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses; difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations; and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made.  If the acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.In January 2018, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Amplify Snack Brands, Inc. While we believe significant operating synergies can be obtained in connection with this acquisition, achievement of these  synergies will be driven by our ability to successfully leverage Hershey's resources, expertise and capability-building.  In addition, the acquisition of Amplify is an important step in our journey to expand our breadth in snacking, as it should enable us to bring scale and category management capabilities to a key sub-segment of the warehouse snack aisle. If we are unable to successfully couple Hershey’s scale and expertise in brand building with Amplify’s existing operations, it may impact our ability to expand our snacking footprint at our desired pace.Changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products. Changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment.  These negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws, laws related to advertising and marketing practices, accounting standards, taxation requirements, competition laws, employment laws and environmental laws, among others.  It is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.8Political, economic and/or financial market conditions could negatively impact our financial results.Our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions, consumer confidence, employment levels, the availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit, consumer debt levels, energy costs and other factors.  Volatility in food and energy costs, sustained global recessions, rising unemployment and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues, profitability and financial condition.Changes in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms, which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our Company, our customers and our suppliers.  A significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service providers, resulting in disruption to our supply chain and/or higher costs, and could impact our customers, resulting in a reduction in our revenue, or a possible increase in bad debt expense.Our international operations may not achieve projected growth objectives, which could adversely impact our overall business and results of operations. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, we derived approximately 17% of our net sales from customers located outside of the United States.  Additionally, approximately 25% of our total long-lived assets were located outside of the United States as of December 31, 2017.  As part of our strategy, we have made investments outside of the United States, particularly in China, Malaysia, Mexico, Brazil and India.  As a result, we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including: Unforeseen global economic and environmental changes resulting in business interruption, supply constraints, inflation, deflation or decreased demand; Inability to establish, develop and achieve market acceptance of our global brands in international markets;Difficulties and costs associated with compliance and enforcement of remedies under a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and regulations; Unexpected changes in regulatory environments; Political and economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, terrorism, mass violence or armed conflict; Nationalization of our properties by foreign governments; Tax rates that may exceed those in the United States and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation; Potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; The imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; Increased costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation; The impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies; Failure to gain sufficient profitable scale in certain international markets resulting in an inability to cover manufacturing fixed costs or resulting in losses from impairment or sale of assets; andFailure to recruit, retain and build a talented and engaged global workforce. If we are not able to achieve our projected international growth objectives and mitigate the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Disruptions, failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations.Information technology is critically important to our business operations.  We use information technology to manage all business processes including manufacturing, financial, logistics, sales, marketing and administrative functions.  These processes collect, interpret and distribute business data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, customers and others.  9We are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats.  Therefore, we continuously monitor and update our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. We invest in industry standard security technology to protect the Company’s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack.  Our data security management program includes identity, trust, vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies.  We measure our data security effectiveness through industry accepted methods and remediate significant findings.  Additionally, we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards.  We maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery, along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third party as part of our business continuity preparedness.  We also have processes in place to prevent disruptions resulting from the implementation of new software and systems of the latest technology.While we have been subject to cyber attacks and other security breaches, these incidents did not have a significant impact on our business operations. We believe our security technology tools and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks. Nevertheless, despite continued vigilance in these areas, disruptions in or failures of information technology systems are possible and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation.  Failure of our systems, including failures due to cyber attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended, could cause transaction errors, loss of customers and sales, and could have negative consequences to our Company, our employees and those with whom we do business. This in turn could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results or operations. In addition, the cost to remediate any damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyber attack could be significant.We might not be able to hire, engage and retain the talented global workforce we need to drive our growth strategies.Our future success depends upon our ability to identify, hire, develop, engage and retain talented personnel across the globe.

Competition for global talent is intense, and we might not be able to identify and hire the personnel we need to continue to evolve and grow our business. In particular, if we are unable to hire the right individuals to fill new or existing senior management positions as vacancies arise, our business performance may be impacted. Activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals require significant time and attention. We may also need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract talented new employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments.    In addition to hiring new employees, we must continue to focus on retaining and engaging the talented individuals we need to sustain our core business and lead our developing businesses into new markets, channels and categories. This may require significant investments in training, coaching and other career development and retention activities. If we are not able to effectively retain and grow our talent, our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely affected, which may impact our financial condition and results of operations.We may not fully realize the expected costs savings and/or operating efficiencies associated with our strategic initiatives or restructuring programs, which may have an adverse impact on our business.We depend on our ability to evolve and grow, and as changes in our business environment occur, we may adjust our business plans by introducing new strategic initiatives or restructuring programs to meet these changes. From time to time, we implement business realignment activities to support key strategic initiatives designed to maintain long-term sustainable growth, such as the production and supply chain network optimization program we commenced in the second quarter of 2016. These programs are intended to increase our operating effectiveness and efficiency, to reduce our costs and/or to generate savings that can be reinvested in other areas of our business. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives and restructuring programs, that we will achieve or sustain the intended benefits under these programs, or that the benefits, even if achieved, will be adequate to meet our long-term growth and profitability expectations, which could in turn adversely affect our business"

Other than statements of historical fact, information regarding activities, events and developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future, including, but not limited to, information relating to our future growth and profitability targets and strategies designed to increase total shareholder value, are forward-looking statements based on management’s estimates, assumptions and projections.  Forward-looking statements also include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future economic and financial condition and results of operations, the plans and objectives of management and our assumptions regarding our performance and such plans and objectives.  Many of the forward-looking statements contained in this document may be identified by the use of words such as “intend,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “should,” “planned,” “projected,” “estimated” and “potential,” among others. Forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are predictions only and actual results could differ materially from management’s expectations due to a variety of factors, including those described below.  All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons working on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such risk factors.  The forward-looking statements that we make in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on management’s current views and assumptions regarding future events and speak only as of their dates. We assume no obligation to update developments of these risk factors or to announce publicly any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements that we make, or to make corrections to reflect future events or developments, except as required by the federal securities laws.Issues or concerns related to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall and/or result in harm to the Company’s reputation, negatively impacting our operating results.In order to sell our iconic, branded products, we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers and consumers.  Issues related to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our Company’s image and reputation.  Negative publicity related to these types of concerns, or related to product contamination or product tampering, whether valid or not, could decrease demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.  We may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption.  In addition, we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions, which could result in payments of fines or damages.  Costs associated with these potential actions could negatively affect our operating results.  Increases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results. We use many different commodities for our business, including cocoa products, sugar, dairy products, peanuts, almonds, corn sweeteners, natural gas and fuel oil. Commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors, including: Commodity market fluctuations;Currency exchange rates;Imbalances between supply and demand;The effect of weather on crop yield;Speculative influences;Trade agreements among producing and consuming nations;Supplier compliance with commitments;Political unrest in producing countries; andChanges in governmental agricultural programs and energy policies.Although we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices, commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs.  If 6we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity. We may be able to pass some or all raw material, energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products; however, higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume and/or consumption.  If we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently, or in a timely manner, to offset increased raw material, energy or other input costs, including packaging, direct labor, overhead and employee benefits, or if our sales volume decreases significantly, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  Market demand for new and existing products could decline. We operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products.  To generate revenues and profits, we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers.  Our continued success is impacted by many factors, including the following:Effective retail execution;Appropriate advertising campaigns and marketing programs;Our ability to secure adequate shelf space at retail locations;Our ability to drive innovation and maintain a strong pipeline of new products in the confectionery and broader snacking categories;Changes in product category consumption;Our response to consumer demographics and trends, including trends relating to store trips and the impact of the growing e-commerce channel; andConsumer health concerns, including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients.There continues to be competitive product and pricing pressures in the markets where we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins.  We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including retailers and distributors, to compete effectively.  Our largest customer, McLane Company, Inc., accounted for approximately 26% of our total net sales in 2015.  McLane Company, Inc. is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Increased marketplace competition could hurt our business. The global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive and consolidation in this industry continues.  Some of our competitors are large companies that have significant resources and substantial international operations.  We continue to experience increased levels of in-store activity for other snack items, which pressured confectionery category growth.  In order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment, we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising, and must continue to introduce and establish new products.  Due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance, increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits.  In addition, we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment. Disruption to our manufacturing operations or supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver finished products, resulting in a negative impact on our operating results.Approximately two-thirds of our manufacturing capacity is located in the United States.  Disruption to our global manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from, among other factors, the following:7Natural disaster;Pandemic outbreak of disease;Weather;Fire or explosion;Terrorism or other acts of violence;Labor strikes or other labor activities; Unavailability of raw or packaging materials; andOperational and/or financial instability of key suppliers, and other vendors or service providers.We believe that we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions.  We have strategies and plans in place to manage disruptive events if they were to occur, including our global supply chain strategies and our principle-based global labor relations strategy.  If we are unable, or find that it is not financially feasible, to effectively plan for or mitigate the potential impacts of such disruptive events on our manufacturing operations or supply chain, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if such events were to occur.  Our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures.From time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives.  The success of such activity depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable buyers, sellers or business partners; perform effective assessments prior to contract execution; negotiate contract terms; and, if applicable, obtain government approval.  These activities may present certain financial, managerial, staffing and talent, and operational risks, including diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses; difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations; and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made.  If the acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.During 2015, we faced a number of challenges in connection with the ongoing integration of SGM.  Since its acquisition in 2014, the SGM business has performed below expectations, with net sales and earnings well below pre-acquisition levels.  In addition, issues with the quality of SGM’s accounts receivables and existing distributor networks have affected our ability to fully realize many of the acquisition benefits that we believe will help accelerate our growth in China and enhance our ability to serve Chinese consumers.  As a result of SGM's poor performance and these other contributing factors, in the second and third quarters of 2015 we recorded a goodwill write-down of approximately $266 million, representing all of the goodwill relating to the SGM reporting unit.  While we believe we have appropriate strategies in place that will allow us to accelerate the SGM integration in 2016, additional challenges that impede further integration could jeopardize our growth strategy in China and could have a negative impact on the results of operations and cash flows of our International and Other reportable segment.Changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products. Changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment.  These negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws, laws related to advertising and marketing practices, accounting standards, taxation requirements, competition laws, employment laws and environmental laws, among others.  It is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Political, economic and/or financial market conditions could negatively impact our financial results.Our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions, consumer confidence, employment levels, the availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit, consumer debt levels, energy costs and other factors.  Volatility in food and energy costs, sustained 8global recessions, rising unemployment and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues, profitability and financial condition.Changes in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms, which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our Company, our customers and our suppliers.  A significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service providers, resulting in disruption to our supply chain and/or higher costs, and could impact our customers, resulting in a reduction in our revenue, or a possible increase in bad debt expense.Our expanding international operations may not achieve projected growth objectives, which could adversely impact our overall business and results of operations. In 2015, we derived approximately 17% of our net sales from customers located outside of the United States, versus 19% in 2014 and 18% in 2013.  Additionally, approximately 32% of our total long-lived assets were located outside of the United States as of December 31, 2015.  As part of our global growth strategy, we have made investments outside of the United States, particularly China and Asia, Mexico and Brazil.  As a result, we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including: Unforeseen global economic and environmental changes resulting in business interruption, supply constraints, inflation, deflation or decreased demand; Inability to establish, develop and achieve market acceptance of our global brands in international markets;Difficulties and costs associated with compliance and enforcement of remedies under a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and regulations; Unexpected changes in regulatory environments; Political and economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, terrorism, mass violence or armed conflict; Nationalization of our properties by foreign governments; Tax rates that may exceed those in the United States and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation; Potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; The imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; Increased costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation; The impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies; Failure to gain sufficient profitable scale in certain international markets resulting in an inability to cover manufacturing fixed costs or resulting in losses from impairment or sale of assets; andFailure to recruit, retain and build a talented and engaged global workforce. If we are not able to achieve our projected international growth objectives and mitigate the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Disruptions, failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations.Information technology is critically important to our business operations.  We use information technology to manage all business processes including manufacturing, financial, logistics, sales, marketing and administrative functions.  These processes collect, interpret and distribute business data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, customers and others.  We invest in industry standard security technology to protect the Company’s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack.  Our data security management program includes identity, trust, vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies.  We measure our data security effectiveness through industry accepted methods and remediate significant findings.  Additionally, we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards.  9We maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery, along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third party as part of our business continuity preparedness.  We also have processes in place to prevent disruptions resulting from the implementation of new software and systems of the latest technology.While we believe that our security technology and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks, disruptions in or failures of information technology systems are possible and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation.  Failure of our systems, including failures due to cyber attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended, could cause transaction errors, loss of customers and sales, and could have negative consequences to our Company, our employees, and those with whom we do business.We might not be able to hire, engage and retain the talented global workforce we need to drive our growth strategies.Our people continue to be our most important asset, and our future success depends upon our ability to identify, hire, develop, engage and retain talented personnel across the globe. Competition for global talent is intense, and we might not be able to identify and hire the personnel we need to continue to evolve and grow our business. In particular, if we are unable to hire the right individuals to fill the new senior management positions created as a result of the productivity initiative we announced in June 2015, our business performance may be impacted. Activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals require significant time and attention. We may also need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract talented new employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments.    In addition to hiring new employees, we must continue to focus on retaining and engaging the talented individuals we need to sustain our core business and lead our developing businesses into new markets, channels and categories. This may require significant investments in training, coaching and other career development and retention activities. If we are not able to effectively retain and grow our talent, our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely affected, which may impact our financial condition and results of operations"

In North America, we announced a weighted average price increase in July 2014 of approximately 8% across our instant consumable, multi-pack, packaged candy and grocery lines to help offset part of the significant increases in our input costs, including raw materials, packaging, fuel, utilities and transportation, which we expect to incur in the future.  While the increase was effective immediately, direct buying customers were given an opportunity to purchase transitional amounts of product at price points prior to the increase during the immediately following four-week period, and the increase is not expected to benefit seasonal sales until Halloween 2015.  Accordingly, we expect that the majority of the financial benefit from this pricing action will impact earnings in 2015. Market demand for new and existing products could decline. We operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products.  To generate revenues and profits, we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers.

In 2014, we derived approximately 18% of our net sales from customers located outside of the United States, versus 17% in 2013 and 16% in 2012.  Additionally, 35% of our total consolidated assets were located outside of the United States as of December 31, 2014.  As part of our global growth strategy, we are increasing our investments outside of the United States, particularly in Mexico, Brazil, India and China.  As a result, we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including: Unforeseen global economic and environmental changes resulting in business interruption, supply constraints, inflation, deflation or decreased demand; Inability to establish, develop and achieve market acceptance of our global brands in international markets;Difficulties and costs associated with compliance and enforcement of remedies under a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and regulations; Unexpected changes in regulatory environments; Political and economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, terrorism, mass violence or armed conflict; Nationalization of our properties by foreign governments; Tax rates that may exceed those in the United States and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation; Potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; The imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; Increased costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation; The impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies; Failure to gain sufficient profitable scale in certain international markets resulting in losses from impairment or sale of assets; andFailure to recruit, retain and build a talented and engaged global workforce.If we are not able to achieve our projected international growth objectives and mitigate the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Disruptions, failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations.Information technology is critically important to our business operations.

Failure of our systems, including failures due to cyber attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended, could cause transaction errors, loss of customers and sales, and could have negative consequences to our Company, our employees, and those with whom we do business.Future developments related to civil antitrust lawsuits and the possible investigation by government regulators of alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industry in the United States could negatively impact our reputation and our operating results.  We are a defendant in a number of civil antitrust lawsuits in the United States, including individual, class and putative class actions brought against us by purchasers of our products.  The U.S. Department of Justice also notified the Company in 2007 that it had opened an inquiry into certain alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industry, but has not requested any information or documents.  Additional information about these proceedings is contained in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Competition and antitrust law investigations can be lengthy and violators are subject to civil and/or criminal fines and other sanctions.  Class action civil antitrust lawsuits are expensive to defend and could result in significant judgments, including in some cases, payment of treble damages and/or attorneys' fees to the successful plaintiff.  Additionally, negative publicity involving these proceedings could affect our Company's brands and reputation, possibly resulting in decreased demand for our products.  These possible consequences, in our opinion, currently are not expected to materially impact our financial position or liquidity, but could materially impact our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which any fines, settlements or judgments are accrued or paid, respectively"
6,HSY,HERSHEY CO,2014-02-21,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORS We are subject to changing economic, competitive, regulatory and technological risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we note the following factors that, among others, could cause future results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, expectations and assumptions expressed or implied in this report.  Many of the forward-looking statements contained in this document may be identified by the use of words such as “intend,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “should,” “planned,” “projected,” “estimated” and “potential,” among others.  Among the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results projected in our forward-looking statements or could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations are the risk factors described below. Issues or concerns related to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall and/or result in harm to the Company’s reputation, negatively impacting our operating results.In order to sell our iconic, branded products, we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers and consumers.  Issues related to quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging, could jeopardize our Company’s image and reputation.  Negative publicity related to these types of concerns, or related to product contamination or product tampering, whether valid or not, could decrease demand for our products, or cause production and delivery disruptions.  We may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption.  In addition, we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions, which could result in payments of fines or damages.  Costs associated with these potential actions could negatively affect our operating results.  Increases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results. We use many different commodities for our business, including cocoa products, sugar, dairy products, peanuts, almonds, corn sweeteners, natural gas and fuel oil. Commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors, including: Commodity market fluctuations;Currency exchange rates;Imbalances between supply and demand;The effect of weather on crop yield;Speculative influences;Trade agreements among producing and consuming nations;Supplier compliance with commitments;Political unrest in producing countries; andChanges in governmental agricultural programs and energy policies.Although we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts, where possible, to hedge commodity prices, commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs.  If we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity. We may be able to pass some or all raw material, energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products; however, higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume and/or consumption.  If we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently to offset increased raw material, energy or other input costs, including packaging, direct labor, overhead and employee benefits, or if our sales volume decreases significantly, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 9Market demand for new and existing products could decline. We operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products.  To generate revenues and profits, we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers.  Our continued success is impacted by many factors, including the following:Effective retail execution;Appropriate advertising campaigns and marketing programs;Our ability to secure adequate shelf space at retail locations;Product innovation, including maintaining a strong pipeline of new products;Changes in product category consumption;Our response to consumer demographics and trends; andConsumer health concerns, including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients.There continue to be competitive product and pricing pressures in these markets, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins.  We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including retailers and distributors, to compete effectively.  Our largest customer, McLane Company, Inc., accounted for approximately 25.5% of our total net sales in 2013.  McLane Company, Inc. is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Increased marketplace competition could hurt our business. The global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive and consolidation in this industry continues.  Some of our competitors are much larger companies that have greater resources and more substantial international operations.  In order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment, we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising, and continue to introduce and establish new products.  Due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance, increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits.  In addition, we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment. Disruption to our manufacturing operations or our supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver our finished products, resulting in a negative impact on our operating results.Approximately three-quarters of our manufacturing capacity is located in the United States.  Disruption to our global manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from, among other factors, the following:Natural disaster;Pandemic outbreak of disease;Weather;Fire or explosion;Terrorism or other acts of violence;Labor strikes or other labor activities; Unavailability of raw or packaging materials; andOperational and/or financial instability of key suppliers, and other vendors or service providers.We believe that we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions.  We have strategies and plans in place to manage such events if they were to occur, including our global supply chain strategies and our principle-based global labor relations strategy.  If we are unable, or find that it is not financially feasible, to effectively plan for or mitigate potential impacts of such disruptive events on our manufacturing operations or supply chain, our financial condition and  results of operations could be negatively impacted if such events were to occur.  10Our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures.From time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives.  The success of such activity depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable buyers, sellers or business partners; perform effective assessments prior to contract execution; negotiate contract terms; and, if applicable, obtain government approval.  These activities may present certain financial, managerial, staffing and talent, and operational risks, including diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses; difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations; and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made.  If the acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products. Changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment.  These negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws, laws related to advertising and marketing practices, accounting standards, taxation requirements, competition laws, employment laws and environmental laws, among others.  It is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Political, economic, and/or financial market conditions could negatively impact our financial results.Our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions, consumer confidence, employment levels, availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit, consumer debt levels, energy costs and other factors.  Volatility in food and energy costs, sustained global recessions, rising unemployment and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues, profitability and financial condition.Changes in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our Company, our customers and our suppliers.  A significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service providers, resulting in disruption to our supply chain and/or higher costs, and could impact our customers, resulting in a reduction in our revenue, or a possible increase in bad debt expense.11International operations may not achieve projected growth objectives, which could adversely impact our overall business and results of operations. In 2013, we derived approximately 16.6% of our net sales from customers located outside of the United States.  Additionally, 19.4% of our total consolidated assets were located outside of the United States as of December 31, 2013.  As part of our global growth strategy, we are increasing our investments outside of the United States, particularly in Mexico, Brazil, India and China.  As a result, we are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including: Unforeseen global economic and environmental changes resulting in business interruption, supply constraints, inflation, deflation or decreased demand; Inability to establish, develop and achieve market acceptance of our global brands in international markets;Difficulties and costs associated with compliance and enforcement of remedies under a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and regulations; Unexpected changes in regulatory environments; Political and economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, terrorism, mass violence or armed conflict; Nationalization of our properties by foreign governments; Tax rates that may exceed those in the United States and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation; Potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; The imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; Increased costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation; The impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies; Failure to gain sufficient profitable scale in certain international markets resulting in losses from impairment or sale of assets; andFailure to recruit, retain and build a talented and engaged global workforce.If we are not able to achieve our projected international growth objectives and mitigate numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Disruptions, failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations.Information technology is critically important to our business operations.  We use information technology to manage all business processes including manufacturing, financial, logistics, sales, marketing and administrative functions.  These processes collect, interpret and distribute business data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, customers and others.  We invest in industry standard security technology to protect the Company’s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack.  Our data security management program includes identity, trust, vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies.  We measure our data security effectiveness through industry accepted methods and remediate significant findings.  Additionally, we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards.  We maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery, along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third party as part of our business continuity preparedness.  We also have processes in place to prevent disruptions resulting from the implementation of new software and systems of the latest technology.While we believe that our security technology and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks, disruptions in or failures of information technology systems are possible and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation.  Failure of our systems, including failures due to cyber attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended, could cause transaction 12errors, loss of customers and sales, and could have negative consequences to our Company, our employees, and those with whom we do business.Future developments related to civil antitrust lawsuits and the possible investigation by government regulators of alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industry in the United States could negatively impact our reputation and our operating results.  We are a defendant in a number of civil antitrust lawsuits in the United States, including individual, class, and putative class actions brought against us by purchasers of our products.  The U.S. Department of Justice also notified the Company in 2007 that it had opened an inquiry into certain alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industry, but has not requested any information or documents.  Additional information about these proceedings is contained in Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-K.  Competition and antitrust law investigations can be lengthy and violators are subject to civil and/or criminal fines and other sanctions.  Class action civil antitrust lawsuits are expensive to defend and could result in significant judgments, including in some cases, payment of treble damages and/or attorneys' fees to the successful plaintiff.  Additionally, negative publicity involving these proceedings could affect our Company's brands and reputation, possibly resulting in decreased demand for our products.  These possible consequences, in our opinion, currently are not expected to materially impact our financial position or liquidity, but could materially impact our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which any fines, settlements or judgments are accrued or paid, respectively"
14,HSY,HERSHEY CO,2013-02-22,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORS We are subject to changing economic, competitive, regulatory and technological risks and uncertainties because of the nature of our operations.  In connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we note the following factors that, among others, could cause future results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, expectations and assumptions expressed or implied in this report.  Many of the forward-looking statements contained in this document may be identified by the use of words such as “intend,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “should,” “planned,” “projected,” “estimated” and “potential,” among others.  Among the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results projected in our forward-looking statements are the risk factors described below. Issues or concerns related to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall and/or result in harm to the Company’s reputation, negatively impacting our operating results.In order to sell our iconic, branded products, we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers and consumers.  Issues related to quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging, could jeopardize our Company’s image and reputation.  Negative publicity related to these types of concerns, or related to product contamination or product tampering, whether valid or not, might negatively impact demand for our products, or cause production and delivery disruptions.  We may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption.  In addition, we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions, which could result in payments of fines or damages.  Costs associated with these potential actions could negatively affect our operating results.  Increases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results. We use many different commodities for our business, including cocoa products, sugar, dairy products, peanuts, almonds, corn sweeteners, natural gas and fuel oil. 9Commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors, including: Commodity market fluctuations;Currency exchange rates;Imbalances between supply and demand;The effect of weather on crop yield;Speculative influences;Trade agreements among producing and consuming nations;Supplier compliance with commitments;Political unrest in producing countries; andChanges in governmental agricultural programs and energy policies.Although we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts, where possible, to hedge commodity prices, commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs.

In 2007, the Competition Bureau of Canada began an inquiry into alleged violations of the Canadian Competition Act in the sale and supply of chocolate products sold in Canada between 2002 and 2008 by members of the confectionery industry, including Hershey Canada, Inc.  The U.S. Department of Justice also notified the Company in 2007 that it had opened an inquiry, but has not requested any information or documents.

We sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans.  Changes in interest rates or in the market value of plan assets could affect the funded status of our pension plans.  This could cause volatility in our benefits costs and increase future funding requirements for our pension plans.  Additionally, we could incur pension settlement losses if a significant number of employees who have retired or have left the Company decide to withdraw substantial lump sums from their pension accounts.  A significant increase in pension expense, in pension settlement losses or in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

These processes collect, interpret and distribute business data and communicate internally andexternally with employees, suppliers, customers and others.   13 We invest in industry standard security technology to protect the Companys data andbusiness processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack. Our data security management program includes identity, trust, vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as enforcement of standard data protectionpolicies such as Payment Card Industry compliance. We measure our data security effectiveness through industry accepted methods and remediate critical findings. Additionally, we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced servicesthrough accepted security certification measures. We maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery, along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third party as part of our business continuitypreparedness.  While we believe that our security technology and processes are adequate in preventing security breaches and inreducing cybersecurity risks, disruptions or failure of information technology systems is possible and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation. Failure of our systems, including failures due to cyber attacks that wouldprevent the ability of systems to function as intended could cause transaction errors, loss of customers and sales, and could have negative consequences to our Company, our employees, and those with whom we do business. Future developments related to the investigation by government regulators of alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industrycould impact our reputation, the regulatory environment under which we operate, and our operating results.  Governmentregulators are investigating alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industry in Canada. We are cooperating fully with the relevant authorities. We are also party to a number of civil antitrust suits in the United States andCanada. On December 31, 2011, Hershey Canada, Inc. entered into an agreement to settle the Canadian lawsuits. The settlement is subject to court approval. These matters could have a negative impact on our Companys reputation. We also maybe required to incur further costs associated with these matters and/or be subject to fines or damages. In addition, our costs could increase if we became subject to new or additional government-mandated regulatory controls. These possible actionscould negatively impact our future operating results.  Pension costs or funding requirements could increase at a higher than anticipatedrate.  We sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans. Changes in interest rates or in the market value of planassets could affect the funded status of our pension plans. This could cause volatility in our benefits costs and increase future funding requirements for our pension plans. Additionally, we could incur pension settlement losses if a significantnumber of employees who have retired or have left the Company decide to withdraw substantial lump sums from their pension accounts. A significant increase in pension expense, in pension settlement losses or in future funding requirements could havea negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. For more information, refer to page 43. Implementation of our Project Next Century program may not occur within the anticipated timeframe and/or may exceed our cost estimates. Inaddition, annual savings from this initiative may be less than we expect.  Completion of the Project Next Centuryprogram, described in greater detail beginning on page 24, is subject to multiple operating and executional risks, including coordination of manufacturing changes and production line startups, among others. If we are not able to complete the programinitiatives within the anticipated timeframe and within our cost estimates and/or if expected cost reductions from efficiency improvements are not realized, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. We estimatethat the Project Next Century program will incur pre-tax charges and non-recurring project implementation costs in the $150 million to $160 million range over the three-year implementation period. When fully implemented, Project Next Century isexpected to provide annual cost savings from efficiency improvements of $65 million to $80 million.   14"
7,HSY,HERSHEY CO,2011-02-18,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORS   We are subject to changing economic, competitive, regulatory and technological risks and uncertainties because of the nature of our operations. In connection with the safe harbor provisions ofthe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we note the following factors that, among others, could cause future results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, expectations and assumptions expressed or implied in thisreport. Many of the forward-looking statements contained in this document may be identified by the use of words such as intend, believe, expect, anticipate, should, planned,projected, estimated and potential, among others. Among the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results projected in our forward-looking statements are the risk factorsdescribed below.  Issues or concerns related to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging could cause a productrecall and/or result in harm to the Companys reputation, negatively impacting our operating results.  In order tosell our iconic, branded products, we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers and consumers. Issues related to quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging, could jeopardize our Companys image and reputation.Negative publicity related to these types of concerns, or related to product contamination or product tampering, whether valid or not, might negatively impact demand for our products, or   10 cause production and delivery disruptions. We may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption. In addition, we could potentially be subject to litigation orgovernment actions, which could result in payments of fines or damages. Costs associated with these potential actions could negatively affect our operating results.  Increases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results. We use many different commodities for our business, including cocoa products, sugar, dairy products, peanuts, almonds, corn sweeteners,natural gas and fuel oil.  Commodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors,including:      Commodity market fluctuations;      Currency exchange rates;      Imbalances between supply and demand;      The effect of weather on crop yield;      Speculative influences;      Trade agreements among producing and consuming nations;     Supplier compliance with commitments;      Political unrest in producing countries; and      Changes in governmental agricultural programs and energy policies. Although we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts, where possible, to hedge commodity prices, commodity priceincreases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs. If we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy, there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financialcondition.  Price increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volumedeclines associated with pricing elasticity.  We may be able to pass some or all raw material, energy and other inputcost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products; however, higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume. If we are not able toincrease our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently to offset increased raw material, energy or other input costs, including packaging, direct labor, overhead and employee benefits, or if our sales volume decreases significantly, therecould be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  Market demand for new and existing products coulddecline.  We operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products. To generate revenuesand profits, we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers. Our continued success is impacted by many factors, including the following:      Effective retail execution;      Appropriate advertising campaigns and marketing programs;     Our ability to secure adequate shelf space at retail locations;     Product innovation, including maintaining a strong pipeline of new products;   11    Changes in product category consumption;      Our response to consumer demographics and trends; and     Consumer health concerns, including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients. Our largest customer, McLane Company, Inc., accounted for approximately 22.1% of our total net sales in 2010 reflecting the continuingconsolidation of our customer base. In this environment, there continue to be competitive product and pricing pressures, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers,including retailers and distributors, to compete effectively. McLane Company, Inc. is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers, including Wal-MartStores, Inc.  Increased marketplace competition could hurt our business. The global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive. Some of our competitors are much larger firms that have greaterresources and more substantial international operations. In order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment, we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions andadvertising, and continue to introduce and establish new products. Due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance, increasedexpenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits. In addition, we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retailenvironment.  Disruption to our supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver our finished products, resulting in anegative impact on our operating results.  Disruption to our manufacturing operations or our supply chain could resultfrom, but are not limited to, the following:      Natural disaster;      Pandemic outbreak of disease;      Weather;      Fire or explosion;      Terrorism or other acts of violence;      Labor strikes;      Unavailability of raw or packaging materials; and      Operational and/or financial instability of key suppliers, and other vendors or service providers. We take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions, and have plans in place to manage such events if they wereto occur. If we are unable, or if it is not financially feasible, to effectively mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such disruptive events, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. Our financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures. From time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures that align with ourstrategic objectives. The success of such activity depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable buyers,   12 sellers or business partners; perform effective assessments prior to contract execution; negotiate contract terms; and, if applicable, obtain government approval. These activities may presentcertain financial, managerial and operational risks, including diversion of managements attention from existing core businesses; difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations; and challenges presented byacquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made. If the acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed, there could be a negativeimpact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  Changes in governmental laws and regulations could increaseour costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products.  Changes in laws and regulations and the manner in whichthey are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment. These negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws, laws related to advertising and marketing practices, accounting standards, taxation requirements, competitionlaws, employment laws and environmental laws, among others. It is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our results ofoperations and financial condition.  Political, economic, and/or financial market conditions could negatively impact our financialresults.  Our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which are affected by generalmacroeconomic conditions, consumer confidence, employment levels, availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit, consumer debt levels, energy costs and other factors. Volatility in food and energy costs, sustained globalrecessions, rising unemployment and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues, profitability and financial condition.  Changes in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our Company, our customersand our suppliers. A significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service providers, resulting in disruption to our supply chain and/or higher costs, and could impact our customers,resulting in a reduction in our revenue, or a possible increase in bad debt expense.  International operations could fluctuateunexpectedly and adversely impact our business.  In 2010, we derived approximately 15.2% of our net sales fromcustomers located outside of the United States. Some of our assets are also located outside of the United States. As part of our global growth strategy, we are increasing our investments outside of the United States, particularly in Mexico, Indiaand China. As a result, we are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including:      Unforeseen global economic and environmental changes resulting in business interruption, supply constraints, inflation, deflation or decreased demand;     Difficulties and costs associated with compliance and enforcement of remedies under a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and regulations;     Different regulatory structures and unexpected changes in regulatory environments;     Political and economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, terrorism, mass violence or armed conflict;     Nationalization of our properties by foreign governments;     Tax rates that may exceed those in the United States and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes uponrepatriation;   13    Potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;     The imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;     Increased costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation;     The impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies; and     Failure to gain sufficient profitable scale in certain international markets resulting in losses from impairment or sale of assets. Disruptions, failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impacton our operations.  Information technology is an important part of our business operations. We use informationtechnology to manage business processes, collect and interpret business data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, customers and others. We have backup systems and business continuity plans in place; however, adisruption or failure could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation.

Our operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases which areaffected by general macroeconomic conditions, consumer confidence, employment levels, availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit, consumer debt levels, energy costs and other factors. Continued volatility in food and energycosts, a sustained global recession, rising unemployment, and continued declines in personal spending could adversely impact the Companys revenues, profitability and financial condition.  Domestic and international financial institutions have reported significant losses as a result of asset write-offs. In addition, short and long-term debtinvestors have become increasingly cautious in providing financing to companies. As a result of these two events, our Company, our customers and our suppliers could face difficulty in securing debt financing. While governments around the world areenacting measures to support financial institutions and the credit markets, there are no guarantees that these efforts will ultimately succeed. If they do not, increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets couldcontinue. This could result in reduced liquidity for our Company, our customers and our suppliers. If current credit market conditions continue, the Company could experience an increase in bad debt expense or liquidity may be reduced and short-termfinancing costs could increase. These conditions could impair our ability to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms, resulting in higher interest expense, or reduced cash flows.  International operations could fluctuate unexpectedly and adversely impact our business.  In 2008, we derived approximately 14.4% of our net sales from customers located outside the United States. Some of our assets are also located outside ofthe United States. As part of our global growth strategy, we are increasing our investments outside of the United States, particularly in India and China. As a result, we are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties relating to internationalsales and operations, including:      Unforeseen global economic and environmental changes resulting in business interruption, supply constraints, inflation, deflation or decreased demand;     Difficulties and costs associated with complying with, and enforcing remedies under a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and regulations;     Different regulatory structures and unexpected changes in regulatory environments;      Political and economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest;      Nationalization of our properties by foreign governments;      Tax rates that may exceed those in the United States and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation;     Potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;      The imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;      Increased costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation;      The impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies; and      Failure to gain sufficient profitable scale in certain international markets resulting in losses from impairment or sale of assets.   12 Table of ContentsFuture developments related to the investigation by government regulators of alleged pricing practices by membersof the confectionery industry could impact our reputation, the regulatory environment under which we operate, and our operating results.  Government regulators are investigating alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industry in certain jurisdictions. We are cooperating fully with all relevant authorities. These allegations could have a negative impact onour Companys reputation. We also may be required to incur defense costs in litigation or government action and/or be subject to fines or damages. In addition, our costs could increase if we became subject to new or additionalgovernment-mandated regulatory controls. These possible actions could negatively impact our future operating results.  Pension costs or fundingrequirements could increase at a higher than anticipated rate.  Changes in interest rates or in the market value of plan assetscould affect the funded status of our pension plans. This could cause volatility in our benefits costs and increase future funding requirements of our pension plans. Additionally, we could incur pension settlement losses if a significant number ofemployees who have retired or have left the company decide to withdraw substantial lump sums from their pension accounts. Pension settlement losses of approximately $15.3 million and $11.8 million were incurred during 2008 and 2007, respectively,and we anticipate additional settlement costs in 2009. As of December 31, 2008, our pension benefits obligations exceeded the fair value of our pension plan assets by $40.8 million. A significant increase in pension expense or in future fundingrequirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. For more information, refer to page 42.  Annual savings from initiatives to transform our supply chain and advance our value-enhancing strategy may be less than we expect.  In February 2007, we announced a comprehensive global supply chain transformation program which includes a phased three-year plan to enhance our manufacturing, sourcing and customer service capabilities. We expectongoing annual savings from this program and previous initiatives to generate significant savings to invest in our growth initiatives and to advance our value-enhancing strategy. If ongoing annual savings do not meet our expectations, we may notobtain the anticipated future benefits.  Implementation of our global supply chain transformation program may not occur within the anticipatedtimeframe and/or may exceed our cost estimates.  Completion of the global supply chain transformation program is subject to multipleoperating and executional risks, including coordination of manufacturing changes, production line startups, cross-border legal, regulatory and political issues, and foreign currency exchange risks, among others. If we are not able to complete theprogram initiatives within the anticipated timeframe and within our cost estimates, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. We estimate that the global supply chain transformation program will incur pre-taxcharges and non-recurring project implementation costs at the upper end of a $575 million to $600 million range over the three-year implementation period, excluding possible increases in pension settlement charges as discussed on pages 49 and 50.  "
13,HSY,HERSHEY CO,2008-02-19,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORS  We are subjectto changing economic, competitive, regulatory and technological risks and uncertainties because of the nature of our operations. In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, wenote the following factors that, among others, could cause future results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, expectations and assumptions expressed or implied in this report. Many of the forward-looking statements contained inthis document may be identified by the use of words such as intend, believe, expect, anticipate, should, planned, projected, estimated andpotential, among others. Among the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results projected in our forward-looking statements are the risk factors described below.  Annual savings from initiatives to transform our supply chain and advance our value-enhancing strategy may be less than we expect.  In February 2007, we announced a comprehensive, supply chain transformation program which includes a phased three-year plan to enhance our manufacturing,sourcing and customer service capabilities. We expect ongoing annual savings from this program and previous initiatives to generate significant savings to invest in our growth initiatives and to advance our value-enhancing strategy. If ongoingannual savings do not meet our expectations, we may not obtain the anticipated future benefits.  Increases in raw material and energy costs couldaffect future financial results.  We use many different commodities for our business, including cocoa beans, cocoa products, sugar,dairy products, peanuts, almonds, corn sweeteners, natural gas and fuel oil.  Commodities are subject to price volatility and changes insupply caused by:      Commodity market fluctuations;      Currency exchange rates;      Imbalances between supply and demand;      The effect of weather on crop yield;      Speculative influences;      Trade agreements among producing and consuming nations;      Political unrest in producing countries; and      Changes in governmental agricultural programs and energy policies.  Although we use forward contracts and commodity futures contracts, where possible, to hedge commodity prices, commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energycosts. If we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy, there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. 9 Table of Contents  Price increases may not be sufficientto offset cost increases and maintain profitability.  We may be able to pass some or all raw material, energy and other input costincreases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products; however, higher product prices or decreased product size may also result in a reduction in sales volume. If we are not able to increaseour selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently to offset increased raw material, energy or other input costs, including packaging, direct labor, overhead and employee benefits, or if our sales volume decreases significantly, there could bea negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.  Implementation of our supply chain transformation program may not occurwithin the anticipated timeframe and/or may exceed our cost estimates.  We announced a comprehensive supply chain transformationprogram in February 2007 which is expected to be completed by December 2009. We estimate that this program will incur pre-tax charges and non-recurring project implementation costs of $525 million to $575 million over the three-year period.Completion of this program is subject to multiple operating and executional risks, including coordination of manufacturing changes, production line startups, cross-border legal, regulatory and political issues, and foreign currency exchange risks,among others. If we are not able to complete the program initiatives within the anticipated timeframe and within our cost estimates, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.  Issues related to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging could cause a product recall, resulting in harm to the Companys reputationand negatively impacting our operating results.  In order to sell our iconic, branded products, we need to maintain a goodreputation with our customers and consumers. Issues related to quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging, could jeopardize our Companys image and reputation. Negative publicity related to these types of concerns, or relatedto product contamination or product tampering, whether valid or not, might negatively impact demand for our products, or cause production and delivery disruptions. We may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption.In addition, we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions, which could result in payments of fines or damages. Costs associated with these potential actions could negatively affect our operating results.  A product recall and related temporary plant closure during the fourth quarter of 2006 was caused by a contaminated ingredient purchased from an outsidesupplier. We have filed a claim for damages and are currently in litigation. A receivable was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets related to the anticipated recovery of damages. Future developments in this case could impact ourability to recover the costs we incurred for the recall and temporary plant closure from responsible third-parties.  Future developments related tothe investigation by government regulators of alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industry could impact our reputation, the regulatory environment under which we operate, and our operating results.  Government regulators are investigating alleged pricing practices by members of the confectionery industries in certain jurisdictions. We are cooperatingfully with all relevant authorities. These allegations could have a negative impact on our Companys reputation. We may also be subject to subsequent litigation or government action, including payment of fines or damages. We may incur increasedcosts associated with this investigation. In addition, our costs could increase if we would be required to pay fines or damages, or institute additional, new, government-mandated regulatory controls. These possible actions could negatively impactour future operating results. 10 Table of Contents  Pension costs could increase at ahigher than anticipated rate.

The fair value of our pensionplan assets exceeded pension benefits obligations as of December 31, 2007. However, a significant increase in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Increases in our stock price could increase expenses.  Changes in the price of our Common Stock expose us to market risks. Expenses for incentive compensation could increase due to an increase in the price of our Common Stock.  Market demand for new and existing products could decline.  We operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products. To generate revenues and profits, we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers. Continued success isdependent on product innovation, including maintaining a strong pipeline of new products, effective retail execution, appropriate advertising campaigns and marketing programs, and the ability to secure adequate shelf space at retail locations. Inaddition, success depends on our response to consumer trends, consumer health concerns, including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients, and changes in product category consumption and consumer demographics.  Our largest customer, McLane Company, Inc., accounted for approximately 26% of our total net sales in 2007 reflecting the continuing consolidation of ourcustomer base. In this environment, there continue to be competitive product and pricing pressures, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including retailersand distributors, to compete effectively. McLane Company, Inc. is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Increased marketplace competition could hurt our business.  The global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive, as is the broader snack market. Some of our competitors are much larger firms that have greater resources and more substantial internationaloperations. In order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment, we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising, and continue to introduce andestablish new products. Due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance, increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintainingor enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits. In addition, we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment.  Changes in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products.  Changes in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment. This could affect our resultsof operations or increase our liabilities. These negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws, laws related to advertising and marketing practices, accounting standards, taxation requirements, competition laws, employment lawsand environmental laws, 11 Table of Contents  among others. It is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that couldresult in an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
