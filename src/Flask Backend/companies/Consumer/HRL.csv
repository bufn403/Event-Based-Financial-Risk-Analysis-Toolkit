16,HRL,HORMEL FOODS CORP,2023-12-06,"  RISK FACTORSBusiness and Operational RisksDeterioration of economic conditions could harm the Company’s business. The Company's business may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, tax rates, availability of capital, energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges), political developments, civil unrest, and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Decreases in consumer spending rates and shifts in consumer product preferences could also negatively impact the Company.Volatility in financial markets and the deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact the Company’s operations as follows:▪The financial stability of the Company's customers and suppliers may be compromised, which could result in challenges in collecting accounts receivable or non-performance by suppliers.▪Unfavorable economic conditions may lead customers and consumers to delay or reduce purchases of the Company's products.6Table of Contents▪Customer demand for products may not materialize to levels required to achieve the Company's anticipated financial results or may decline as distributors and retailers seek to reduce inventory positions if there is an economic downturn or economic uncertainty in key markets.▪The value of the Company's investments in debt and equity securities may decline, including most significantly the trading securities held as part of a rabbi trust to fund supplemental executive retirement plans and deferred income plans and the Company’s assets held in pension plans.▪Future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets could impair the Company's liquidity or increase costs of borrowing.▪The Company may be required to redirect cash flow from operations or explore alternative strategies, such as disposing of assets, to fulfill the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness.The Company has no operations in Russia or Ukraine, yet it has experienced inflated fuel costs and supply chain shortages and delays due to the impact of the military conflict on the global economy. If this conflict, or others such as the Israel-Hamas war, escalates further, it could result in, among other things, additional supply chain disruptions, rising prices for oil and other commodities, volatility in capital markets and foreign exchange rates, rising interest rates, or heightened cybersecurity risks, any of which may adversely affect the Company's business. In addition, the effects of the ongoing conflict could heighten many of the other risk factors included in Item 1A.The Company utilizes hedging programs to manage its exposure to various market risks, such as commodity prices and interest rates, which qualify for hedge accounting for financial reporting purposes. Volatile fluctuations in market conditions could cause these instruments to become ineffective, which could require any gains or losses associated with these instruments to be reported in the Company’s earnings each period. These instruments may limit the Company’s ability to benefit from market gains if commodity prices and/or interest rates become more favorable than those secured under the Company’s hedging programs. The Company's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Impairment testing requires judgment around estimates and assumptions and is impacted by factors such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, tax rates, royalty rates, and discount rates. An unfavorable change in these factors may lead to the impairment of goodwill and/or intangible assets. During fiscal 2023, an impairment was indicated for the Justin's® trade name, resulting in an impairment charge of $28.4 million.Additionally, if a highly pathogenic human disease outbreak developed, such as COVID-19, it may negatively impact the global economy, demand for Company products, the supply chain, the Company's co-manufacturers, and/or the Company’s workforce availability including leadership, and the Company’s financial results could suffer. The Company has developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on its operations, and will continue to update these plans as necessary. There can be no assurance given, however, that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative effects of any such diseases on the Company’s operating results.The Company’s operations are subject to the general risks associated with acquisitions, joint ventures, equity investments, and divestitures. The Company regularly reviews opportunities to support the Company’s strategic initiative of delivering long-term value to shareholders through acquisitions, joint ventures, and equity investments and to divest non-strategic assets. The Company has made several acquisitions, joint ventures, equity investments, and divestitures in recent years, including the acquisition of the Planters® snack nuts business in fiscal 2021 and purchase of a minority interest in Garudafood in fiscal 2023. Potential risks associated with these transactions include the inability to consummate a transaction timely or on favorable terms, diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, loss of key employees and customers of current or acquired companies, inability to integrate or divest operations successfully, assumption of unknown liabilities, disputes with buyers, sellers, or partners, inability to obtain favorable financing terms, impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved, and the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which the Company has limited or no prior experience. Due to the nature of these arrangements, joint ventures and equity investments involve further risks, including the possibility that the Company is unable to execute business strategies and manage operations given limitations of the Company's control. Additionally, partners may become bankrupt, make business decisions that are inconsistent with the Company's goals, or block or delay necessary decisions. Acquisitions, joint ventures, or equity investments outside the U.S. may also present unique challenges and increase the Company's exposure to the risks associated with foreign operations. Any or all of these risks could impact the Company’s financial results and business reputation. The Company's level of indebtedness increased significantly to fund the purchase of the Planters® snack nuts business and may continue to increase to fund future acquisitions, joint ventures, or equity investments. Higher levels of debt may, among other things, impact the Company's liquidity and increase the Company's exposure to negative fluctuations in interest rates. During fiscal 2023, an impairment was indicated for the Justin's® trade name, resulting in an impairment charge of $28.4 million and the Company recorded a $7.0 million impairment charge related to a corporate venturing investment to recognize a decline in fair value not believed to be temporary.The Company is subject to disruption of operations at co-manufacturers, suppliers, logistics providers, customers, or other third-party service providers.▪Disruption of operations at co‑manufacturers, suppliers, or logistics providers have and may continue to impact the Company’s product and input supplies as well as the ability to distribute products.7Table of Contents▪Disruptions related to significant customers or sales channels has and could continue to result in a reduction in sales or change in the mix of products sold.▪Disruption in services from partners such as third-party service providers used to support various business functions such as benefit plan administration, payroll processing, information technology and cloud computing services could have an adverse effect on the Company's business.Disruptions of third-party providers have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on the Company's financial results. Actions taken to mitigate the impact of any potential disruption, including increasing inventory in anticipation of a potential production or supply interruption, may adversely affect the Company’s financial results. Additionally, labor-related challenges have caused disruptions for many of these providers and may continue to impact the Company's ability to receive inputs or distribute products.The Company may not realize the anticipated cost savings or operating efficiencies associated with strategic initiatives. The Company operates in the highly competitive food industry and is subject to volatile cost inputs. Strategic initiatives are implemented to achieve a profitable cost structure, operate efficiently, better serve customers, and optimize cash flow. These initiatives may focus on opportunities to improve the procurement, manufacturing, and logistics within the Company’s supply chain as well as general and administrative processes. A failure or delay in implementing the improvements associated with these strategic initiatives could adversely impact the Company’s results, ability to meet its long-term growth expectations, and ability to fund future initiatives.The Company began an enterprise transformation and modernization initiative in the second half of fiscal 2023 to provide cost savings and operating efficiencies by fiscal 2026. If this initiative does not achieve the expected financial impact or is not completed in a timely manner, the Company’s financial results and ability to meet its long-term growth expectations could be adversely impacted.The Company is subject to the loss of a material contract. The Company is a party to several supply, distribution, contract packaging and other material contracts. The loss of a material contract or failure to obtain new material contracts could adversely affect the Company’s financial results.The Company may be adversely impacted if the Company is unable to protect information technology systems against, or effectively respond to, cyber attacks or security breaches. Information technology systems are an important part of the Company’s business operations. In addition, the Company increasingly relies upon third-party service providers for a variety of business functions, including cloud-based services. Cyber incidents are occurring more frequently across U.S. industries and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. Continued high-profile data security incidents at other companies evidence an external environment that is becoming increasingly hostile. From time to time, the Company has experienced, and may experience in the future, breaches of its security measures due to human error, malfeasance, insider threats, system errors or vulnerabilities or other irregularities, none of which have been material to date. Remote work arrangements may bring additional information technology and data security risks.Although the Company has programs in place related to business continuity, disaster recovery, and information security initiatives to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems, business applications, and customer information, the Company may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all potential cybersecurity threats, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, both domestic and foreign. Cybersecurity risk is increasingly difficult to identify and quantify and cannot be fully mitigated because of the rapidly evolving nature of the threats, targets, and consequences. In addition, the Company is in the midst of multi-year data and technology transformation projects to achieve better analytics, customer service, and process efficiencies. The projects, including modernizing the order-to-cash process, are expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business transaction processes and the underlying systems environment. Multiple phases of these projects have already been implemented and additional phases are expected to be implemented in the upcoming years. These implementations are a major undertaking from a financial, management, and personnel perspective and may prove to be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected, and there can be no assurance that these projects will be beneficial to the extent anticipated. Deterioration of labor relations, labor availability or increases in labor costs could harm the Company’s business. As of October 29, 2023, the Company employed approximately 20,000 people worldwide, of which approximately 20 percent were represented by labor unions, principally the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. Union contracts at two of the Company's manufacturing facilities, covering approximately 250 employees, will expire during fiscal 2024. A significant increase in labor costs or a deterioration of labor relations at any of the Company’s facilities or co-manufacturing facilities resulting in work slowdowns or stoppages could harm the Company’s financial results. Labor and skilled labor availability challenges could continue to have an adverse effect on the Company's business.8Table of ContentsIndustry RisksThe Company’s operations are subject to the general risks of the food industry. The food products manufacturing industry is subject to the risks posed by:▪food spoilage;▪food contamination caused by disease-producing organisms or pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, and pathogenic E coli.; ▪food allergens;▪nutritional and health-related concerns; ▪federal, state, and local food processing controls; ▪consumer product liability claims;▪product tampering; and ▪the possible unavailability and/or expense of liability insurance.The pathogens that may cause food contamination are found generally in livestock and in the environment and thus may be present in the Company's products. These pathogens can also be introduced to products as a result of improper handling by customers or consumers. The Company does not have control over handling procedures once products have been shipped for distribution. If one or more of these risks were to materialize, the Company’s brand and business reputation could be negatively impacted. In addition, revenues could decrease, costs of doing business could increase, and the Company’s operating results could be adversely affected.Outbreaks of disease among livestock and poultry flocks could harm the Company’s revenues and operating margins. The Company is subject to risks associated with the outbreak of disease in pork and beef livestock, and poultry flocks, including African swine fever (ASF), Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), pneumo-virus, Porcine Circovirus 2 (PCV2), Porcine Reproduction & Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDv), and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). The outbreak of such diseases could adversely affect the Company’s supply of raw materials, increase the cost of production, reduce utilization of the Company’s harvest facilities, and reduce operating margins. The impact of global climate change may increase these risks due to changes in weather or migratory patterns which may result in certain types of diseases occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Additionally, the outbreak of disease may hinder the Company’s ability to market and sell products both domestically and internationally.In recent years, the outbreak of ASF has impacted hog herds in China, Asia, Europe, and the Caribbean. If an outbreak of ASF were to occur in the U.S., the Company's supply of hogs and pork could be materially impacted.HPAI was detected within the Company's turkey supply chain during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and first quarter of fiscal 2024. The impact of HPAI has reduced and will continue to reduce production volume in the Company's turkey facilities into fiscal 2024. The Company is continuing to monitor the situation and will take the appropriate actions to protect the health of the turkeys across the supply chain. The Company has developed business continuity plans for various disease scenarios and will continue to update these plans as necessary. There can be no assurance given, however, that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative effects of any such diseases on the Company’s operating results.Fluctuations in commodity prices and availability of raw materials and other inputs could harm the Company’s earnings. The Company’s results of operations and financial condition are largely dependent upon the cost and supply of pork, poultry, beef, feed grains, and nuts as well as supplies, energy and other inputs and the selling prices for many of the Company's products, which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand.The Company takes a balanced approach to sourcing pork raw materials, including hogs purchased for the Austin, Minnesota processing facility, long-term supply agreements for pork, and spot market purchases of pork. This approach ensures a more stable supply of raw materials while minimizing extreme fluctuations in costs over the long-term. This may result, in the short-term, in higher or lower live hog costs compared to the cash spot market. Market-based pricing on certain product lines, and lead time required to implement pricing adjustments, may prevent all or part of these cost increases from being recovered, and these higher costs could adversely affect the Company's short-term financial results.The Company raises turkeys and contracts with turkey growers to meet its raw material requirements for whole birds and processed turkey products. Results in these operations are affected by the cost and supply of feed grains, which fluctuate due to climate conditions, production forecasts, and supply and demand conditions at local, regional, national, and worldwide markets. The Company attempts to manage some of its short-term exposure to fluctuations in feed prices by forward buying, using futures contracts, and pursuing pricing advances. However, these strategies may not be adequate to overcome sustained increases in market prices due to alternate uses for feed grains or other changes in these market conditions.9Table of ContentsThe Company may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for nuts, tomatoes, avocados, or other produce if poor growing conditions have a negative effect on agricultural productivity. Reductions in crop size or quality due to unfavorable growing conditions may have an adverse effect on the Company’s results.The supplies of natural and organic proteins may impact the Company’s ability to ensure a continuing supply of these products. To mitigate this risk, the Company partners with multiple long-term suppliers. International trade barriers and other restrictions or disruptions could result in decreased foreign demand and increased domestic supply of proteins, thereby potentially lowering prices. The Company occasionally utilizes in-country production to limit this exposure.Market demand for the Company’s products may fluctuate. The Company faces competition from producers of alternative meats and protein sources, including pork, beef, turkey, chicken, fish, nuts, nut butters, whey, and plant-based proteins. The factors on which the Company competes include:▪price;▪product quality and attributes;▪brand identification;▪breadth of product line; and▪customer service.Demand for the Company’s products is also affected by competitors’ promotional spending, the effectiveness of the Company’s advertising and marketing programs, and consumer perceptions. Failure to identify and react to changes in food trends such as sustainability of product sources and animal welfare could lead to, among other things, reduced demand for the Company’s brands and products. The Company may be unable to compete successfully on any or all of these factors in the future.Damage to the Company’s reputation or brand image can adversely affect its business. Maintaining and continually enhancing the perception of the Company’s reputation and brands is critical to business success. The Company’s reputation and brands have been in the past and could in the future be adversely impacted by a number of factors, including unfavorable consumer perception related to events or rumors, adverse publicity, and negative information disseminated through social and digital media. Failure to maintain, extend, and expand the Company’s reputation or brand image could adversely impact operating results.Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business and results of operations. There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. If such climate change has a negative impact on agricultural productivity, the Company may have decreased availability or less favorable pricing for the raw materials necessary for its operations. Climate change may also cause decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and supply chain. In addition, natural disasters and extreme weather, including those caused by climate change, could cause disruptions in the Company’s operations and supply chain.The increasing concern over climate change may also result in greater local, state, federal, and foreign legal requirements, including requirements to limit greenhouse gas emissions or conserve water usage. If such requirements are enacted, the Company could experience significant cost increases in its operations and supply chain. The Company has developed and publicly announced goals to reduce its impact on the environment such as the 20 by 30 Challenge and the recently announced validation of its greenhouse gas reduction targets by the Science Based Targets initiative. The Company's ability to achieve these goals is subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of which are outside of its control. Examples include, among others, evolving regulatory requirements, disclosure frameworks, and methodologies for reporting data. Failure to accomplish goals set by the Company related to climate change or meet expectations of various Company stakeholders may cause decreased demand for the Company’s products and have an adverse effect on results of operations.Legal and Regulatory RisksThe Company’s operations are subject to the general risks of litigation. The Company is involved on an ongoing basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Trends in litigation may include class actions involving employees, consumers, competitors, suppliers, shareholders, or others, and claims relating to product liability, contract disputes, antitrust regulations, intellectual property, advertising, labeling, wage and hour laws, employment practices or environmental matters. Neither litigation trends nor the outcomes of litigation can be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could negatively affect the Company’s financial results. 10Table of ContentsGovernment regulation, present and future, exposes the Company to potential sanctions and compliance costs that could adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, federal and state taxing authorities and other federal, state, and local authorities which oversee workforce immigration, taxation, animal welfare, food safety, and the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, and labeling of the Company’s products. The Company’s manufacturing facilities and products are subject to ongoing inspection by federal, state and local authorities. Claims or enforcement proceedings could be brought against the Company in the future. The availability of government inspectors due to a government furlough could also cause disruption to the Company’s manufacturing facilities. Additionally, the Company is subject to new or modified laws, regulations, and accounting standards. The Company’s failure or inability to comply with such requirements could subject the Company to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions. A federal district court ruling has had a negative impact on harvest capacity and labor costs. Harvest facilities the Company uses are negotiating to resolve the situation and expect to reach a solution, but harvest capacity and labor costs may continue to be negatively impacted until a solution is reached. There can be no assurance a solution will be reached, in which case the negative impacts of the ruling would continue.The Company is subject to stringent environmental regulations and potentially subject to environmental litigation, proceedings, and investigations. The Company’s past and present business operations and ownership and operation of real property are subject to stringent federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes (including solid and hazardous wastes) or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations, as well as any modifications, is material to the Company’s business. Some of the Company’s facilities have been in operation for many years and, over time, the Company and other prior operators of these facilities may have generated and disposed of wastes that now may be considered hazardous. Future discovery of contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of the Company’s present or former properties or manufacturing facilities and/or waste disposal sites could require the Company to incur additional expenses related to additional investigation, assessment or other requirements. The occurrence of any of these events, the implementation of new laws and regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws or regulations could adversely affect the Company’s financial results.The Company’s foreign operations pose additional risks to the Company’s business. The Company operates its business and markets its products internationally. The Company’s foreign operations are subject to the risks described above, as well as risks related to fluctuations in currency values, foreign currency exchange controls, compliance with foreign laws, compliance with applicable U.S. laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other economic or political uncertainties. International sales are subject to risks related to general economic conditions, imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other restrictions, enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and compliance with applicable foreign laws, and other economic and political uncertainties. All of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial results"
10,HRL,HORMEL FOODS CORP,2022-12-06,"  RISK FACTORS Business and Operational RisksDeterioration of economic conditions could harm the Company’s business. The Company's business may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, tax rates, availability of capital, energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges), political developments, civil unrest, and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Decreases in consumer spending rates and shifts in consumer product preferences could also negatively impact the Company.Volatility in financial markets and the deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact the Company’s operations as follows:▪The financial stability of the Company's customers and suppliers may be compromised, which could result in additional bad debts or non-performance by suppliers.▪The value of the Company's investments in debt and equity securities may decline, including most significantly the trading securities held as part of a rabbi trust to fund supplemental executive retirement plans and deferred income plans, and the Company’s assets held in pension plans.▪Future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets could impair the Company's liquidity or increase costs of borrowing.6Table of Contents▪The Company may be required to redirect cash flow from operations or explore alternative strategies, such as disposing of assets, to fulfill the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness.The Company has no operations in Russia or Ukraine, yet it has experienced inflated fuel costs and supply chain shortages and delays due to the impact of the military conflict on the global economy. Further escalation related to the conflict, including increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, could result in, among other things, additional supply chain disruptions, rising prices for oil and other commodities, volatility in capital markets and foreign exchange rates, rising interest rates or heightened cybersecurity risks, any of which may adversely affect the Company's business. In addition, the effects of the ongoing conflict could heighten many of the other risk factors included in Item 1A.The Company utilizes hedging programs to manage its exposure to various market risks, such as commodity prices and interest rates, which qualify for hedge accounting for financial reporting purposes. Volatile fluctuations in market conditions could cause these instruments to become ineffective, which could require any gains or losses associated with these instruments to be reported in the Company’s earnings each period. These instruments may limit the Company’s ability to benefit from market gains if commodity prices and/or interest rates become more favorable than those secured under the Company’s hedging programs. The Company's goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Impairment testing requires judgment around estimates and assumptions and is impacted by factors such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, tax rates, royalty rates, and discount rates. An unfavorable change in these factors may lead to the impairment of goodwill and/or intangible assets.Additionally, if another highly pathogenic human disease outbreak developed, it may negatively impact the global economy, demand for Company products, and/or the Company’s workforce availability, and the Company’s financial results could suffer. The Company has developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on its operations, and will continue to update these plans as necessary. There can be no assurance given, however, that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative effects of any such diseases on the Company’s operating results.The COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 global pandemic has had, and may continue to have, negative impacts across many of the Company's business units and facilities. The near- and long-term impacts of COVID-19 are unknown and impossible to predict with any level of certainty. The following potential risk factors arising from the COVID-19 pandemic have had and/or may continue to have one or more of the following impacts on the Company's operations: ▪One or more of the Company's manufacturing facilities may be shut down or have their operations significantly impacted due to employee illnesses, increased absenteeism, and/or actions by government agencies. Capital projects may be delayed as additional capacity is no longer currently needed or materials are unavailable. The Company's co-manufacturers and material suppliers may face similar impacts.▪Operating costs may increase as measures are put in place to prevent or slow down the spread of COVID-19, such as compliance with regulatory restrictions, vaccine mandates, facility improvements, employee testing, short-term disability policies, and manufacturing employee bonus payments. ▪Operations may be negatively impacted if members of the Company's leadership team, or other key employees, become ill with COVID-19 or otherwise terminate their employment as a result of COVID-19. Further, the Company may face challenges with labor availability, relations, labor costs, hiring, onboarding, and training new employees, including leadership, which may impact results. The Company also may face operational challenges if government quarantine orders restrict movement of employees.▪Supply chain disruptions of various types arising from COVID-19 may impact the Company's ability to make products, the cost for such products, and the ability to deliver products to customers. Closure or reduced operations of material suppliers could result in shortages of key raw materials, as well as impact prices for those materials. The volatility in the market for raw material and supplies could impact the Company's profitability.▪National, state, and local government orders closing or limiting operation of borders and ports, or imposing quarantine, could impact the Company's ability to obtain raw materials and to deliver finished goods to customers.▪Closures or reduced operations at foodservice establishments may impact results for the Company's foodservice business. Bankruptcy filings and/or delinquent payments from the foodservice industry or other customers may negatively impact cash flow. ▪A national and/or global economic downturn may impact consumer purchase behavior, such as reduced volume for foodservice products and premium brands. ▪If the Company's public relations efforts related to the pandemic are not effective or if consumers perceive them to be irresponsible, the Company's competitive position, reputation, and market share may suffer. The extent of the impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations is dependent on the length and severity of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact the Company's operations in one or more ways not identified to date.The Company’s operations are subject to the general risks associated with acquisitions and divestitures. The Company has made several acquisitions and divestitures in recent years, including the acquisition of the Planters® snack nuts business in 7Table of ContentsJune 2021, that align with the Company’s strategic initiative of delivering long-term value to shareholders. The Company regularly reviews strategic opportunities to grow through acquisitions and to divest non-strategic assets. Potential risks associated with these transactions include the inability to consummate a transaction timely or on favorable terms, diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, potential loss of key employees and customers of current or acquired companies, inability to integrate or divest operations successfully, possible assumption of unknown liabilities, potential disputes with buyers or sellers, inability to obtain favorable financing terms, potential impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved, and the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which the Company has limited or no prior experience. Any or all of these risks could impact the Company’s financial results and business reputation. In addition, acquisitions outside the U. S. may present unique challenges and increase the Company's exposure to the risks associated with foreign operations. The Company's level of indebtedness increased significantly to fund the purchase of the Planters® snack nuts business and may continue to increase to fund future acquisitions. Higher levels of debt may, among other things, impact the Company's liquidity and increase the Company's exposure to negative fluctuations in interest rates.The Company is subject to disruption of operations at co-manufacturers, suppliers, logistics providers, customers, or other third-party service providers. ▪Disruption of operations at co‑manufacturers, suppliers, or logistics providers have and may continue to impact the Company’s product and input supplies as well as the ability to distribute products.▪Disruptions related to significant customers or sales channels has and could continue to result in a reduction in sales or change in the mix of products sold.▪Disruption in services from partners such as third-party service providers used to support various business functions such as benefit plan administration, payroll processing, information technology and cloud computing services could have an adverse effect on the Company's business.Any of these disruptions could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial results. Actions taken to mitigate the impact of any potential disruption, including increasing inventory in anticipation of a potential production or supply interruption, may adversely affect the Company’s financial results. Additionally, labor-related challenges have caused disruptions for many of these providers and may continue to impact the Company's ability to receive inputs or distribute products. The Company is subject to the loss of a material contract. The Company is a party to several supply, distribution, contract packaging and other material contracts. The loss of a material contract or failure to obtain new material contracts could adversely affect the Company’s financial results. The Company may be adversely impacted if the Company is unable to protect information technology systems against, or effectively respond to, cyber attacks or security breaches. Information technology systems are an important part of the Company’s business operations. In addition, the Company increasingly relies upon third-party service providers for a variety of business functions, including cloud-based services. Cyber incidents are occurring more frequently and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. From time to time, the Company has experienced, and may experience in the future, breaches of its security measures due to human error, malfeasance, insider threats, system errors or vulnerabilities or other irregularities, none of which have been material to date. Remote work arrangements may bring additional information technology and data security risks.In addition, the Company is in the midst of a multi-year transformation project (Project Orion) to achieve better analytics, customer service, and process efficiencies through the use of Oracle Cloud Solutions. This project is expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business transaction processes and the underlying systems environment. During fiscal 2020, the Company implemented the human resource, payroll, and finance phases of the project. Additional integrations are expected to take place over the next few years. Such an implementation is a major undertaking from a financial, management, and personnel perspective. The implementation of the enterprise resource planning system may prove to be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected, and there can be no assurance that this system will be beneficial to the extent anticipated. In an attempt to mitigate these risks, the Company has implemented and continues to evaluate security initiatives and business continuity plans.Deterioration of labor relations, labor availability or increases in labor costs could harm the Company’s business. As of October 30, 2022, the Company employed more than 20,000 people worldwide, of which approximately 20 percent were represented by labor unions, principally the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. Union contracts at four of the Company's manufacturing facilities, covering approximately 2,400 employees, will expire during fiscal 2023. Negotiations have not yet been initiated. A significant increase in labor costs or a deterioration of labor relations at any of the Company’s facilities or co-manufacturing facilities resulting in work slowdowns or stoppages could harm the Company’s financial results. Labor and skilled labor availability challenges could continue to have an adverse effect on the Company's business.8Table of ContentsIndustry RisksThe Company’s operations are subject to the general risks of the food industry. The food products manufacturing industry is subject to the risks posed by:▪food spoilage;▪food contamination caused by disease-producing organisms or pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, and pathogenic E coli.; ▪food allergens;▪nutritional and health-related concerns; ▪federal, state, and local food processing controls; ▪consumer product liability claims;▪product tampering; and ▪the possible unavailability and/or expense of liability insurance. The pathogens that may cause food contamination are found generally in livestock and in the environment and thus may be present in the Company's products. These pathogens can also be introduced to products as a result of improper handling by customers or consumers. The Company does not have control over handling procedures once products have been shipped for distribution. If one or more of these risks were to materialize, the Company’s brand and business reputation could be negatively impacted. In addition, revenues could decrease, costs of doing business could increase, and the Company’s operating results could be adversely affected.Outbreaks of disease among livestock and poultry flocks could harm the Company’s revenues and operating margins. The Company is subject to risks associated with the outbreak of disease in pork and beef livestock, and poultry flocks, including African swine fever (ASF), Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), pneumo-virus, Porcine Circovirus 2 (PCV2), Porcine Reproduction & Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDv), and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). The outbreak of such diseases could adversely affect the Company’s supply of raw materials, increase the cost of production, reduce utilization of the Company’s harvest facilities, and reduce operating margins. Additionally, the outbreak of disease may hinder the Company’s ability to market and sell products both domestically and internationally. In recent years, the outbreak of ASF has impacted hog herds in China, Asia, Europe, and the Caribbean. If an outbreak of ASF were to occur in the U.S., the Company's supply of hogs and pork could be materially impacted.HPAI was detected within the U.S. in 2022 and was confirmed within the Company's Jennie-O Turkey Store supply chain. The impact of HPAI has reduced and will continue to reduce production volume in the Company's turkey facilities at least through the first half of fiscal 2023. The Company is continuing to monitor the situation and will take the appropriate actions to protect the health of the turkeys across the supply chain. The Company has developed business continuity plans for various disease scenarios and will continue to update these plans as necessary. There can be no assurance given, however, that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative effects of any such diseases on the Company’s operating results.Fluctuations in commodity prices and availability of raw materials and other inputs could harm the Company’s earnings. The Company’s results of operations and financial condition are largely dependent upon the cost and supply of pork, poultry, beef, feed grains, and nuts as well as supplies, energy and other inputs and the selling prices for many of the Company's products, which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand.The Company takes a balanced approach to sourcing pork raw materials, including hogs purchased for the Austin, Minnesota processing facility, long-term supply agreements for pork, and spot market purchases of pork. This approach ensures a more stable supply of raw materials while minimizing extreme fluctuations in costs over the long-term. This may result, in the short-term, in higher or lower live hog costs compared to the cash spot market. Market-based pricing on certain product lines, and lead time required to implement pricing adjustments, may prevent all or part of these cost increases from being recovered, and these higher costs could adversely affect the Company's short-term financial results.Jennie-O Turkey Store raises turkeys and contracts with turkey growers to meet its raw material requirements for whole birds and processed turkey products. Results in these operations are affected by the cost and supply of feed grains, which fluctuate due to climate conditions, production forecasts, and supply and demand conditions at local, regional, national, and worldwide markets. The Company attempts to manage some of its short-term exposure to fluctuations in feed prices by forward buying, using futures contracts, and pursuing pricing advances. However, these strategies may not be adequate to overcome sustained increases in market prices due to alternate uses for feed grains or other changes in these market conditions.9Table of ContentsThe Company may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for nuts, tomatoes, avocados, or other produce if poor growing conditions have a negative effect on agricultural productivity. Reductions in crop size or quality due to unfavorable growing conditions may have an adverse effect on the Company’s results.The supplies of natural and organic proteins may impact the Company’s ability to ensure a continuing supply of these products. To mitigate this risk, the Company partners with multiple long-term suppliers. International trade barriers and other restrictions or disruptions could result in decreased foreign demand and increased domestic supply of proteins, thereby potentially lowering prices. The Company occasionally utilizes in-country production to limit this exposure. Market demand for the Company’s products may fluctuate. The Company faces competition from producers of alternative meats and protein sources, including pork, beef, turkey, chicken, fish, nuts, nut butters, whey, and plant-based proteins. The factors on which the Company competes include:▪price;▪product quality and attributes;▪brand identification;▪breadth of product line; and▪customer service.Demand for the Company’s products is also affected by competitors’ promotional spending, the effectiveness of the Company’s advertising and marketing programs, and consumer perceptions. Failure to identify and react to changes in food trends such as sustainability of product sources and animal welfare could lead to, among other things, reduced demand for the Company’s brands and products. The Company may be unable to compete successfully on any or all of these factors in the future.Damage to the Company’s reputation or brand image can adversely affect its business. Maintaining and continually enhancing the perception of the Company’s reputation and brands is critical to business success. The Company’s reputation and brands have been in the past and could in the future be adversely impacted by a number of factors, including unfavorable consumer perception related to events or rumors, adverse publicity, and negative information disseminated through social and digital media. Failure to maintain, extend, and expand the Company’s reputation or brand image could adversely impact operating results.Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business and results of operations. There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. If such climate change has a negative impact on agricultural productivity, the Company may have decreased availability or less favorable pricing for the raw materials necessary for its operations. Climate change may also cause decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and supply chain. In addition, natural disasters and extreme weather, including those caused by climate change, could cause disruptions in the Company’s operations and supply chain.The increasing concern over climate change may also result in greater local, state, federal, and foreign legal requirements, including requirements to limit greenhouse gas emissions or conserve water usage. If such requirements are enacted, the Company could experience significant cost increases in its operations and supply chain. Further, failure to accomplish goals set by the Company related to climate change or meet expectations of various Company stakeholders may cause decreased demand for the Company’s products and have an adverse effect on results of operations.Legal and Regulatory RisksThe Company’s operations are subject to the general risks of litigation. The Company is involved on an ongoing basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Trends in litigation may include class actions involving employees, consumers, competitors, suppliers, shareholders, or others, and claims relating to product liability, contract disputes, antitrust regulations, intellectual property, advertising, labeling, wage and hour laws, employment practices or environmental matters. Neither litigation trends nor the outcomes of litigation can be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could negatively affect the Company’s financial results. Government regulation, present and future, exposes the Company to potential sanctions and compliance costs that could adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, federal and state taxing authorities and other federal, state, and local authorities which oversee workforce immigration, taxation, animal welfare, food safety, and the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, and labeling of the Company’s products. The Company’s manufacturing facilities and products are subject to ongoing inspection by federal, state and local authorities. Claims or enforcement proceedings could be brought against the Company in the future. The availability of government inspectors due 10Table of Contentsto a government furlough could also cause disruption to the Company’s manufacturing facilities. Additionally, the Company is subject to new or modified laws, regulations, and accounting standards. The Company’s failure or inability to comply with such requirements could subject the Company to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions. A recent federal district court ruling has had a negative impact on harvest capacity and labor costs. Harvest facilities the Company uses are negotiating to resolve the situation and expect to reach a solution, but harvest capacity and labor costs will continue to be negatively impacted until a solution is reached. There can be no assurance a solution will be reached, in which case the negative impacts of the ruling would continue.The Company is subject to stringent environmental regulations and potentially subject to environmental litigation, proceedings, and investigations. The Company’s past and present business operations and ownership and operation of real property are subject to stringent federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes (including solid and hazardous wastes) or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations, as well as any modifications, is material to the Company’s business. Some of the Company’s facilities have been in operation for many years and, over time, the Company and other prior operators of these facilities may have generated and disposed of wastes that now may be considered hazardous. Future discovery of contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of the Company’s present or former properties or manufacturing facilities and/or waste disposal sites could require the Company to incur additional expenses related to additional investigation, assessment or other requirements. The occurrence of any of these events, the implementation of new laws and regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws or regulations could adversely affect the Company’s financial results.The Company’s foreign operations pose additional risks to the Company’s business. The Company operates its business and markets its products internationally. The Company’s foreign operations are subject to the risks described above, as well as risks related to fluctuations in currency values, foreign currency exchange controls, compliance with foreign laws, compliance with applicable U.S. laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other economic or political uncertainties. International sales are subject to risks related to general economic conditions, imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other restrictions, enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and compliance with applicable foreign laws, and other economic and political uncertainties. All of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial results"
9,HRL,HORMEL FOODS CORP,2021-12-10,"  RISK FACTORS Business and Operational RisksDeterioration of economic conditions could harm the Company’s business. The Company's business may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, tax rates, availability of capital, energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges), political developments, civil unrest, and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Decreases in consumer spending rates and shifts in consumer product preferences could also negatively impact the Company.Volatility in financial markets and the deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact the Company’s operations as follows:▪The financial stability of our customers and suppliers may be compromised, which could result in additional bad debts for the Company or non-performance by suppliers.▪The value of our investments in debt and equity securities may decline, including most significantly the Company’s trading securities held as part of a rabbi trust to fund supplemental executive retirement plans and deferred income plans, and the Company’s assets held in pension plans.▪Future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets could impair the Company's liquidity or increase costs of borrowing.▪The Company may be required to redirect cash flow from operations or explore alternative strategies, such as disposing of assets, to fulfill the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness.The Company utilizes hedging programs to manage its exposure to various market risks, such as commodity prices and interest rates, which qualify for hedge accounting for financial reporting purposes. Volatile fluctuations in market conditions could cause these instruments to become ineffective, which could require any gains or losses associated with these instruments to be reported in the Company’s earnings each period. These instruments may limit the Company’s ability to benefit from market gains if commodity prices and/or interest rates become more favorable than those secured under the Company’s hedging programs. The Company's goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Impairment testing requires judgement around estimates and assumptions and is impacted by factors such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, tax rates, royalty rates, and discount rates. An unfavorable change in these factors may lead to the impairment of goodwill and/or intangible assets.Additionally, if another highly pathogenic human disease outbreak developed in the United States, it may negatively impact the national economy, demand for Company products, and/or the Company’s workforce availability, and the Company’s financial results could suffer. The Company has developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on its operations, and will continue to update these plans as necessary. There can be no assurance given, however, these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative effects of any such diseases on the Company’s operating results.6Table of ContentsThe uncertain and rapidly changing COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic has had, and will likely continue to have, negative impacts across many of the Company's business units and facilities. The Company's operations and business have been impacted directly and indirectly by various government actions taken to stop or slow the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions, border shutdowns, stay-at-home and shelter-in-place orders, shutdowns of non-essential businesses, and emergency declarations. The near- and long-term impacts of COVID-19 are unknown and impossible to predict with any level of certainty. The following potential risk factors arising from COVID-19 pandemic have had and/or may continue to have one or more of the following impacts on the Company's operations: ▪One or more of the Company's manufacturing facilities may be shut down or have their operations significantly impacted due to employee illnesses, increased absenteeism, and/or actions by government agencies. Capital projects may be delayed as additional capacity is no longer currently needed or materials are unavailable. The Company's co-manufacturers and material suppliers may face similar impacts.▪Regulatory restrictions and measures taken at the Company's facilities to prevent or slow down the spread of COVID-19 may impact the facilities’ efficiency.▪Operating costs may increase as measures are put in place to prevent or slow down the spread of COVID-19, such as facility improvements, employee testing, short-term disability policies, and manufacturing employee bonus payments. ▪Any new or additional measures required by national, state or local governments to combat COVID-19, such as a COVID-19 vaccine mandate, may similarly add additional operational costs. ▪Ongoing closure or reduced operations at foodservice establishments may impact results for the Company's foodservice business. Bankruptcy filings and/or delinquent payments from foodservice industry or other customers may negatively impact cash flow. ▪A national and/or global economic downturn may impact consumer purchase behavior such as reduced volume for foodservice products and premium brands. ▪It may become more difficult and/or expensive to obtain debt or equity financing necessary to sustain the Company's operations, make capital expenditures, and/or finance future acquisitions. ▪The Company may face litigation by stockholders, employees, suppliers, customers, consumers, and others relating to COVID-19 and its effects. ▪The Company relies on its dedicated employees, many of whom have a long tenure with the Company. Operations may be negatively impacted if members of the Company's leadership team, or other key employees, become ill with COVID-19 or otherwise terminate their employment as a result of COVID-19. Further, the Company may face challenges hiring, onboarding, and training new employees, including leadership, which may impact results. The Company also may face operational challenges if government quarantine orders restrict movement of employees.▪It is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic has and continues to negatively affect the Company's labor availability, relations, or labor costs.▪Many of the Company's office-based employees continue to work remotely on occasion, which may bring additional information technology and data security risks.▪Supply chain disruptions of various types arising from COVID-19 may impact the Company's ability to make products, the cost for such products, and the ability to deliver products to customers. Closure or reduced operations of material suppliers could result in shortages of key raw materials, as well as impact prices for those materials. The volatility in the market for raw material and supplies could impact the Company's profitability.▪National, state, and local government orders closing or limiting operation of borders and ports, or imposing quarantine, could impact the Company's ability to obtain raw materials and to deliver finished goods to customers.▪COVID-19 has wide-reaching impacts to society and the business, making all decisions, interactions, and transactions significantly more complex.▪The Company is committed to being transparent through communications to inform shareholders, employees, customers, consumers, and others about the enhanced safety protocols implemented. The Company must keep pace with a rapidly changing media environment. If the Company's public relations efforts are not effective or if consumers perceive them to be irresponsible, the Company's competitive position, reputation, and market share may suffer. The extent of the impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations is dependent on the length and severity of the pandemic. Vaccines to prevent COVID-19 were approved by health agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates, which began to be administered near the end of calendar year 2020. New variants of the virus appear to have increased transmissibility, which could complicate treatment and vaccination programs. The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented situation and the Company's understanding of and response to its impacts is changing and evolving. The additional risk factors identified here are based upon information known at this time. The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact the Company's operations in one or more ways not identified to date.7Table of ContentsThe Company’s operations are subject to the general risks associated with acquisitions and divestitures. The Company has made several acquisitions and divestitures in recent years, including the acquisition of the Planters® snack nuts business in June 2021, that align with the Company’s strategic initiative of delivering long-term value to shareholders. The Company regularly reviews strategic opportunities to grow through acquisitions and to divest non-strategic assets. Potential risks associated with these transactions include the inability to consummate a transaction timely or on favorable terms, diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, potential loss of key employees and customers of current or acquired companies, inability to integrate or divest operations successfully, possible assumption of unknown liabilities, potential disputes with buyers or sellers, inability to obtain favorable financing terms, potential impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved, and the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which the Company has limited or no prior experience. Any or all of these risks could impact the Company’s financial results and business reputation. In addition, acquisitions outside the United States may present unique challenges and increase the Company's exposure to the risks associated with foreign operations. The Company's level of indebtedness increased significantly to fund the purchase of the Planters® snack nuts business and may continue to increase to fund future acquisitions. Higher levels of debt may among other things, impact the Company's liquidity and increase the Company's exposure to negative fluctuations in interest rates.The Company is subject to disruption of operations at co-manufacturers, suppliers, logistics providers, customers, or other third-party service providers. ▪Disruption of operations at co‑manufacturers, suppliers, or logistics providers have and may continue to impact the Company’s product and input supplies as well as the ability to distribute products.▪Disruptions related to significant customers or sales channels has and could continue to result in a reduction in sales or change in the mix of products sold.▪Disruption in services from partners such as third-party service providers used to support various business functions such as benefit plan administration, payroll processing, information technology and cloud computing services could have an adverse effect on the Company's business.Any of these disruptions could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial results. Actions taken to mitigate the impact of any potential disruption, including increasing inventory in anticipation of a potential production or supply interruption, may adversely affect the Company’s financial results. Additionally, labor shortages have caused disruptions for many of these providers and may continue to impact the Company's ability to receive inputs or distribute products. The Company is subject to the loss of a material contract. The Company is a party to several supply, distribution, contract packaging and other material contracts. The loss of a material contract or failure to obtain new material contracts could adversely affect the Company’s financial results. The Company may be adversely impacted if the Company is unable to protect information technology systems against, or effectively respond to, cyber attacks or security breaches. Information technology systems are an important part of the Company’s business operations. In addition, the Company increasingly relies upon third-party service providers for a variety of business functions, including cloud-based services. Cyber incidents are occurring more frequently and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. From time to time, the Company has experienced, and may experience in the future, breaches of our security measures due to human error, malfeasance, insider threats, system errors or vulnerabilities or other irregularities, none of which have been material to date.In addition, the Company is in the midst of a multi-year transformation project (Project Orion) to achieve better analytics, customer service, and process efficiencies through the use of Oracle Cloud Solutions. This project is expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business transaction processes and the underlying systems environment. The initial phase to implement the human resource and payroll process was deployed during the first quarter of fiscal 2020. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company implemented the finance phase of the project. Additional integrations are expected to take place over the next few years. Such an implementation is a major undertaking from a financial, management, and personnel perspective. The implementation of the enterprise resource planning system may prove to be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected, and there can be no assurance that this system will be beneficial to the extent anticipated. In an attempt to mitigate these risks, the Company has implemented and continues to evaluate security initiatives and business continuity plans.Deterioration of labor relations, labor availability or increases in labor costs could harm the Company’s business. As of October 31, 2021, the Company employed more than 20,000 people worldwide, of which approximately 20 percent were represented by labor unions, principally the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. A significant increase in labor costs or a deterioration of labor relations at any of the Company’s facilities or co-manufacturing facilities resulting in work slowdowns or stoppages could harm the Company’s financial results. Labor and skilled labor availability challenges could continue to have an adverse effect on the Company's business.8Table of ContentsIndustry RisksThe Company’s operations are subject to the general risks of the food industry. The food products manufacturing industry is subject to the risks posed by:▪food spoilage;▪food contamination caused by disease-producing organisms or pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, and pathogenic E coli.; ▪food allergens;▪nutritional and health-related concerns; ▪federal, state, and local food processing controls; ▪consumer product liability claims;▪product tampering; and ▪the possible unavailability and/or expense of liability insurance. The pathogens that may cause food contamination are found generally in livestock and in the environment and thus may be present in our products. These pathogens can also be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling by customers or consumers. We do not have control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution. If one or more of these risks were to materialize, the Company’s brand and business reputation could be negatively impacted. In addition, revenues could decrease, costs of doing business could increase, and the Company’s operating results could be adversely affected.Outbreaks of disease among livestock and poultry flocks could harm the Company’s revenues and operating margins. The Company is subject to risks associated with the outbreak of disease in pork and beef livestock, and poultry flocks, including African swine fever (ASF), Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), pneumo-virus, Porcine Circovirus 2 (PCV2), Porcine Reproduction & Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDv), and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). The outbreak of such diseases could adversely affect the Company’s supply of raw materials, increase the cost of production, reduce utilization of the Company’s harvest facilities, and reduce operating margins. Additionally, the outbreak of disease may hinder the Company’s ability to market and sell products both domestically and internationally. In recent years, the outbreak of ASF has impacted hog herds in China, Asia, Europe, and the Caribbean. If an outbreak of ASF were to occur in the United States, the Company's supply of hogs and pork could be materially impacted. The Company has developed business continuity plans for various disease scenarios and will continue to update these plans as necessary. There can be no assurance given, however, that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative effects of any such diseases on the Company’s operating results.Fluctuations in commodity prices and availability of raw materials and other inputs could harm the Company’s earnings. The Company’s results of operations and financial condition are largely dependent upon the cost and supply of pork, poultry, beef, feed grains, and nuts as well as supplies, energy and other inputs and the selling prices for many of our products, which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand.The company takes a balanced approach to sourcing pork raw materials including hogs purchased for our Austin, Minnesota processing facility, long-term supply agreements for pork, and spot market purchases of pork. This approach ensures a more stable supply of raw materials while minimizing extreme fluctuations in costs over the long-term. This may result, in the short-term, in higher or lower live hog costs compared to the cash spot market. Market-based pricing on certain product lines, and lead time required to implement pricing adjustments, may prevent all or part of these cost increases from being recovered, and these higher costs could adversely affect our short-term financial results.Jennie-O Turkey Store raises turkeys and contracts with turkey growers to meet its raw material requirements for whole birds and processed turkey products. Results in these operations are affected by the cost and supply of feed grains, which fluctuates due to climate conditions, production forecasts, and supply and demand conditions at local, regional, national, and worldwide markets. The Company attempts to manage some of its short-term exposure to fluctuations in feed prices by forward buying, using futures contracts, and pursuing pricing advances.

The Company is involved on an ongoing basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Trends in litigation may include class actions involving employees, consumers, competitors, suppliers, shareholders, or others, and claims relating to product liability, contract disputes, antitrust regulations, intellectual property, advertising, labeling, wage and hour laws, employment practices or environmental matters. Neither litigation trends nor the outcomes of litigation can be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could negatively affect the Company’s financial results. Government regulation, present and future, exposes the Company to potential sanctions and compliance costs that could adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, federal and state taxing authorities and other federal, state, and local authorities which oversee workforce immigration, taxation, animal welfare, food safety, and the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, and labeling of the Company’s products. The Company’s manufacturing facilities and products are subject to ongoing inspection by federal, state and local authorities. Claims or enforcement proceedings could be brought against the Company in the future. The availability of government inspectors due to a government furlough could also cause disruption to the Company’s manufacturing facilities. Additionally, the Company is subject to new or modified laws, regulations, and accounting standards. The Company’s failure or inability to comply with such requirements could subject the Company to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions. A recent federal district court ruling has had a negative impact on harvest capacity and labor costs. Harvest facilities the Company uses are negotiating to resolve the situation and expect to reach a solution, but harvest capacity and labor costs will continue to be negatively impacted until a solution is reached. There can be no assurance a solution will be reached, in which case the negative impacts of the ruling would continue.The Company is subject to stringent environmental regulation and potentially subject to environmental litigation, proceedings, and investigations. The Company’s past and present business operations and ownership and operation of real property are subject to stringent federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes (including solid and hazardous wastes) or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations, as well as any modifications, is material to the Company’s business. Some of the Company’s facilities have been in operation for many years and, over time, the Company and other prior operators of these facilities may have generated and disposed of wastes that now may be considered hazardous. Future discovery of contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of the Company’s present or former properties or manufacturing facilities and/or waste disposal sites could require the Company to incur additional expenses related to additional investigation, assessment or other requirements. The occurrence of any of these events, the implementation of new laws and regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws or regulations could adversely affect the Company’s financial results.The Company’s foreign operations pose additional risks to the Company’s business. The Company operates its business and markets its products internationally. The Company’s foreign operations are subject to the risks described above, as well as risks related to fluctuations in currency values, foreign currency exchange controls, compliance with foreign laws, compliance with applicable U.S. laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other economic or political uncertainties. International sales are subject to risks related to general economic conditions, imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other restrictions, enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and compliance with applicable foreign laws, and other economic and political uncertainties. All of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial results.10Table of Contents"

There can be no assurance given, however, these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative effects of any such diseases on the Company’s operating results.The uncertain and rapidly changing COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic has had, and will likely continue to have, negative impacts across many of the Company's business units and facilities. The Company's operations and business have been impacted directly and indirectly by various government actions taken to stop or slow the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions, border shutdowns, stay-at-home and shelter-in-place orders, shutdowns of non-essential businesses, and emergency declarations.

The Company also may face operational challenges if government quarantine orders restrict movement of employees.•It is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively affect the Company's labor availability, relations, or labor costs.•In accordance with recommendations to reduce large gatherings and increase social distancing, many of the Company's office-based employees are working remotely, which may bring additional information technology and data security risks.•Supply chain disruptions of various types arising from COVID-19 may impact the Company's ability to make products, the cost for such products, and the ability to deliver products to customers. Closure or reduced operations of material suppliers could result in shortages of key raw materials, as well as impact prices for those materials. The volatility in the market for raw material and supplies could impact the Company's profitability.•National, state, and local government orders closing or limiting operation of borders and ports, or imposing quarantine, could impact the Company's ability to obtain raw materials and to deliver finished goods to customers.•COVID-19 has wide-reaching impacts to society and the business making all decisions, interactions, and transactions significantly more complex.•The Company is committed to being transparent through communications to inform shareholders, employees, customers, consumers, and others about the enhanced safety protocols implemented. The Company must keep pace with a rapidly changing media environment. If the Company's public relations efforts are not effective or if consumers perceive them to be irresponsible, the Company's competitive position, reputation, and market share may suffer. The Company has already seen several of these risks materialize. The extent of the impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations is dependent on the length and severity of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented situation and the Company's understanding of its impacts is changing and evolving. The additional risk factors identified here are based upon information known at this time. The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact the Company's operations in one or more ways not identified to date.The Company’s operations are subject to the general risks associated with acquisitions and divestitures. The Company has made several acquisitions and divestitures in recent years, most recently the acquisition of Sadler's Smokehouse, that align with the Company’s strategic initiative of delivering long-term value to shareholders. The Company regularly reviews strategic opportunities to grow through acquisitions and to divest non-strategic assets. Potential risks associated with these transactions include the inability to consummate a transaction on favorable terms, the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, the potential loss of key employees and customers of current or acquired companies, the inability to integrate or divest operations successfully, the possible assumption of unknown liabilities, potential disputes with buyers or sellers, potential impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved, and the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which the Company has limited or no prior experience. Any or all of these risks could impact the Company’s financial results and business reputation. In addition, acquisitions outside the United States may present unique challenges and increase the Company's exposure to the risks associated with foreign operations.The Company is subject to disruption of operations at co-manufacturers, suppliers, or other third-party service providers. Disruption of operations at co‑manufacturers or other suppliers may impact the Company’s product or raw material supply, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial results. Additionally, actions taken to mitigate the impact of any potential disruption, including increasing inventory in anticipation of a potential production or supply interruption, may adversely affect the Company’s financial results.The Company regularly engages third-party service providers to support various business functions such as benefit plan administration, payroll processing, information technology, and cloud computing services. A disruption in services from these partners could have an adverse effect on the Company's business.The Company is subject to the loss of a material contract. The Company is a party to several supply, distribution, contract packaging and other material contracts. The loss of a material contract could adversely affect the Company’s financial results. The Company currently sources approximately 30% of its pork raw materials from Wholestone Farms, LLC (Wholestone) under a supply agreement expiring in December 2021. The Company is in negotiations with Wholestone as well as evaluating alternative procurement options. The Company may be adversely impacted if the Company is unable to protect information technology systems against, or effectively respond to, cyber-attacks or security breaches. Information technology systems are an important part of the Company’s business operations. In addition, the Company increasingly relies upon third-party service providers for a variety of business functions, including cloud-based services. Attempted cyber-attack and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. In addition, the Company is in the midst of a multi-year transformation project (Project Orion) to achieve better analytics, customer service, and process efficiencies through the use of Oracle Cloud Solutions. This project is expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business transaction processes and the underlying systems environment. The initial phase to implement the human resource and payroll process was deployed during the first quarter of fiscal 2020. 7Table of ContentsDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company implemented the finance phase of the project. Additional integrations are expected to take place over the next few years. Such an implementation is a major undertaking from a financial, management, and personnel perspective. The implementation of the enterprise resource planning system may prove to be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected, and there can be no assurance that this system will be beneficial to the extent anticipated. In an attempt to mitigate these risks, the Company has implemented and continues to evaluate security initiatives and business continuity plans.Deterioration of labor relations or increases in labor costs could harm the Company’s Business. As of October 25, 2020, approximately 3,470 of the Company's employees were represented by labor unions, principally the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. A significant increase in labor costs or a deterioration of labor relations at any of the Company’s facilities or co-manufacturing facilities resulting in work slowdowns or stoppages could harm the Company’s financial results.INDUSTRY RISKSThe Company’s operations are subject to the general risks of the food industry. The food products manufacturing industry is subject to the risks posed by:▪food spoilage;▪food contamination caused by disease-producing organisms or pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, and pathogenic E coli.; ▪food allergens;▪nutritional and health-related concerns; ▪federal, state, and local food processing controls; ▪consumer product liability claims;▪product tampering; and ▪the possible unavailability and/or expense of liability insurance. The pathogens that may cause food contamination are found generally in livestock and in the environment and thus may be present in our products. These pathogens can also be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling by customers or consumers. We do not have control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution. If one or more of these risks were to materialize, the Company’s brand and business reputation could be negatively impacted. In addition, revenues could decrease, costs of doing business could increase, and the Company’s operating results could be adversely affected.Outbreaks of disease among livestock and poultry flocks could harm the Company’s revenues and operating margins. The Company is subject to risks associated with the outbreak of disease in pork and beef livestock, and poultry flocks, including African swine fever (ASF), Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), pneumo-virus, Porcine Circovirus 2 (PCV2), Porcine Reproduction & Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDv), and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). The outbreak of such diseases could adversely affect the Company’s supply of raw materials, increase the cost of production, reduce utilization of the Company’s harvest facilities, and reduce operating margins. Additionally, the outbreak of disease may hinder the Company’s ability to market and sell products both domestically and internationally. In recent years, the outbreak of ASF has impacted hog herds in China, Asia, and Europe. If an outbreak of ASF were to occur in the United States, the Company's supply of hogs and pork could be materially impacted. The Company has developed business continuity plans for various disease scenarios and will continue to update these plans as necessary. There can be no assurance given, however, that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative effects of any such diseases on the Company’s operating results.Fluctuations in commodity prices and availability of pork, poultry, beef, feed grains, avocados, peanuts, and energy could harm the Company’s earnings. The Company’s results of operations and financial condition are largely dependent upon the cost and supply of pork, poultry, beef, feed grains, avocados, and peanuts as well as energy costs and the selling prices for many of our products, which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand.The live hog industry has evolved to large, vertically-integrated operations using long-term supply agreements. Typically, this results in fewer hogs being available on the cash spot market. Consequently, the Company uses long-term supply contracts priced on market-based formulas or the cost of production to ensure a stable supply of raw materials while minimizing extreme fluctuations in costs over the long-term. This may result, in the short-term, in higher live hog costs compared to the cash spot market, depending on the relationship of the cash spot market to contract prices. Market-based pricing on certain product lines, and lead time required to implement pricing adjustments, may prevent all or part of these cost increases from being recovered, and these higher costs could adversely affect our short-term financial results.Jennie-O Turkey Store raises turkeys and contracts with turkey growers to meet its raw material requirements for whole birds and processed turkey products. Results in these operations are affected by the cost and supply of feed grains, which fluctuates due to climate conditions, production forecasts, and supply and demand conditions at local, regional, national, and worldwide 8Table of Contentsmarkets. The Company attempts to manage some of its short-term exposure to fluctuations in feed prices by forward buying, using futures contracts, and pursuing pricing advances. However, these strategies may not be adequate to overcome sustained increases in market prices due to alternate uses for feed grains or other changes in these market conditions.The supplies of natural and organic proteins may impact the Company’s ability to ensure a continuing supply of these products. To mitigate this risk, the Company partners with multiple long-term suppliers. International trade barriers and other restrictions could result in decreased foreign demand and increased domestic supply of proteins, thereby potentially lowering prices. The Company occasionally utilizes in-country production to limit this exposure. Market demand for the Company’s products may fluctuate. The Company faces competition from producers of alternative meats and protein sources, including pork, beef, turkey, chicken, fish, nut butters, whey, and plant-based proteins. The factors on which the Company competes include:▪price;▪product quality and attributes;▪brand identification;▪breadth of product line; and▪customer service.Demand for the Company’s products is also affected by competitors’ promotional spending, the effectiveness of the Company’s advertising and marketing programs, and consumer perceptions. Failure to identify and react to changes in food trends such as sustainability of product sources and animal welfare could lead to, among other things, reduced demand for the Company’s brands and products. The Company may be unable to compete successfully on any or all of these factors in the future.LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKSThe Company’s operations are subject to the general risks of litigation. The Company is involved on an ongoing basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Trends in litigation may include class actions involving employees, consumers, competitors, suppliers, shareholders, or injured persons, and claims relating to product liability, contract disputes, antitrust regulations, intellectual property, advertising, labeling, wage and hour laws, employment practices or environmental matters. Neither litigation trends nor the outcomes of litigation can be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could negatively affect the Company’s financial results. Government regulation, present and future, exposes the Company to potential sanctions and compliance costs that could adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, federal and state taxing authorities and other federal, state, and local authorities which oversee workforce immigration, taxation, animal welfare, food safety, and the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, and labeling of the Company’s products. The Company’s manufacturing facilities and products are subject to ongoing inspection by federal, state and local authorities. Claims or enforcement proceedings could be brought against the Company in the future. The availability of government inspectors due to a government furlough could also cause disruption to the Company’s manufacturing facilities. Additionally, the Company is subject to new or modified laws, regulations, and accounting standards. The Company’s failure or inability to comply with such requirements could subject the Company to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions.The Company is subject to stringent environmental regulation and potentially subject to environmental litigation, proceedings, and investigations. The Company’s past and present business operations and ownership and operation of real property are subject to stringent federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes (including solid and hazardous wastes) or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations, as well as any modifications, is material to the Company’s business. Some of the Company’s facilities have been in operation for many years and, over time, the Company and other prior operators of these facilities may have generated and disposed of wastes that now may be considered hazardous. Future discovery of contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of the Company’s present or former properties or manufacturing facilities and/or waste disposal sites could require the Company to incur additional expenses related to additional investigation, assessment or other requirements. The occurrence of any of these events, the implementation of new laws and regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws or regulations could adversely affect the Company’s financial results.The Company’s foreign operations pose additional risks to the Company’s business. The Company operates its business and markets its products internationally. The Company’s foreign operations are subject to the risks described above, as well as risks related to fluctuations in currency values, foreign currency exchange controls, compliance with foreign laws, compliance with applicable U.S. laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other economic or political uncertainties. International sales are subject to risks related to general economic conditions, imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other restrictions, enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and compliance with applicable foreign laws, and other economic and political uncertainties. All of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial results.9Table of Contents"
15,HRL,HORMEL FOODS CORP,2019-12-06,"  RISK FACTORS The Company’s operations are subject to the general risks of the food industry.  The food products manufacturing industry is subject to the risks posed by:▪food spoilage;▪food contamination caused by disease-producing organisms or pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, and pathogenic E coli.; ▪food allergens;▪nutritional and health-related concerns; ▪federal, state, and local food processing controls; ▪consumer product liability claims;▪product tampering; and ▪the possible unavailability and/or expense of liability insurance. The pathogens that may cause food contamination are found generally in livestock and in the environment and thus may be present in our products.  These pathogens can also be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling or cooking by customers or consumers.  We do not have control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution.  If one or more of these risks were to materialize, the Company’s brand and business reputation could be negatively impacted.  In addition, revenues could decrease, costs of doing business could increase, and the Company’s operating results could be adversely affected.Deterioration of economic conditions could harm the Company’s business.  The Company's business may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, availability of capital, energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges), and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions.  Decreases in consumer spending rates and shifts in consumer product preferences could also negatively impact the Company.Volatility in financial markets and the deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact the Company’s operations as follows:▪The financial stability of our customers and suppliers may be compromised, which could result in additional bad debts for the Company or non-performance by suppliers; and▪The value of our investments in debt and equity securities may decline, including most significantly the Company’s trading securities held as part of a rabbi trust to fund supplemental executive retirement plans and deferred income plans, and the Company’s assets held in pension plans.The Company utilizes hedging programs to manage its exposure to various commodity market risks, which qualify for hedge accounting for financial reporting purposes.  Volatile fluctuations in market conditions could cause these instruments to become ineffective, which could require any gains or losses associated with these instruments to be reported in the Company’s earnings each period.  These instruments may limit the Company’s ability to benefit from market gains if commodity prices become more favorable than those secured under the Company’s hedging programs. Additionally, if a highly pathogenic human disease outbreak developed in the United States, it may negatively impact the national economy, demand for Company products, and/or the Company’s workforce availability, and the Company’s financial results could suffer.  The Company has developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on its operations, and will continue to update these plans as necessary.  There can be no assurance given, however, these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative effects of any such diseases on the Company’s operating results.Outbreaks of disease among livestock and poultry flocks could harm the Company’s revenues and operating margins.

The outbreak of such diseases could adversely affect the Company’s supply of raw materials, increase the cost of production, reduce utilization of the Company’s harvest facilities, and reduce operating margins.  Additionally, the outbreak of disease may hinder the Company’s ability to market and sell products both domestically and internationally.  Most recently, the outbreak of ASF in China has eliminated over 30 percent of that country's hog herd compared to last year, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People's Republic of China.  The disease has also spread to additional countries in Asia and Europe.  If an outbreak of ASF were to occur in the United States, the Company's supply of hogs and pork could be materially impacted.  The Company has developed business continuity plans for various disease scenarios and will continue to update these plans as necessary.  There can be no assurance given, however, that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative effects of any such diseases on the Company’s operating results.7Table of ContentsFluctuations in commodity prices and availability of pork, poultry, beef, feed grains, avocados, peanuts, energy, and whey could harm the Company’s earnings.

Failure to identify and react to changes in food trends such as sustainability of product sources and animal welfare could lead to, among other things, reduced demand for the Company’s brands and products.  The Company may be unable to compete successfully on any or all of these bases in the future.The Company’s operations are subject to the general risks associated with acquisitions.  The Company has made several acquisitions in recent years, most recently the acquisitions of Columbus, Fontanini, and Ceratti, and regularly reviews opportunities for strategic growth through acquisitions.  Potential risks associated with acquisitions include the inability to integrate new operations successfully, the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, the potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies, the possible assumption of unknown liabilities, potential disputes with the sellers, potential impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline, and the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which the Company has limited or no prior experience.  Any or all of these risks could impact the Company’s financial results and business reputation.  In addition, acquisitions outside the United States may present unique challenges and increase the Company's exposure to the risks associated with foreign operations.The Company is subject to disruption of operations at co-packers or other suppliers.  Disruption of operations at co‑packers or other suppliers may impact the Company’s product or raw material supply, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial results.  Additionally, actions taken to mitigate the impact of any potential disruption, including increasing inventory in anticipation of a potential production or supply interruption, may adversely affect the Company’s financial results.The Company’s operations are subject to the general risks of litigation.  The Company is involved on an ongoing basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business.  Trends in litigation may include class actions involving employees, consumers, competitors, suppliers, shareholders, or injured persons, and claims relating to product liability, contract disputes, intellectual property, advertising, labeling, wage and hour laws, employment practices, or environmental matters.  Litigation trends and the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could adversely affect the Company’s financial results. The Company is subject to the loss of a material contract.  The Company is a party to several supply, distribution, contract packaging, and other material contracts.  The loss of a material contract could adversely affect the Company’s financial results.  Government regulation, present and future, exposes the Company to potential sanctions and compliance costs that could adversely affect the Company’s business.  The Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, federal and state taxing authorities, and other federal, state, and local authorities who oversee workforce immigration laws, tax regulations, animal welfare, food safety standards, and the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, and labeling of the Company’s products.  The Company’s manufacturing facilities and products are subject to continuous inspection by federal, state, and local authorities.  Claims or enforcement proceedings could be brought against the Company in the future.  The availability of government inspectors due to a government furlough could also cause disruption to the Company’s manufacturing facilities.  Additionally, the Company is subject to new or modified laws, regulations, and accounting standards.  The Company’s failure or inability to comply with such requirements could subject the Company to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls, or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions.8Table of ContentsThe Company is subject to stringent environmental regulation and potentially subject to environmental litigation, proceedings, and investigations.  The Company’s past and present business operations and ownership and operation of real property are subject to stringent federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes (including solid and hazardous wastes) or otherwise relating to protection of the environment.  Compliance with these laws and regulations, and the ability to comply with any modifications to these laws and regulations, is material to the Company’s business.  New matters or sites may be identified in the future requiring additional investigation, assessment, or expenditures.  In addition, some of the Company’s facilities have been in operation for many years and, over time, the Company and other prior operators of these facilities may have generated and disposed of wastes that now may be considered hazardous.  Future discovery of contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of the Company’s present or former properties or manufacturing facilities and/or waste disposal sites could require the Company to incur additional expenses.  The occurrence of any of these events, the implementation of new laws and regulations, or stricter interpretation of existing laws or regulations could adversely affect the Company’s financial results.The Company’s foreign operations pose additional risks to the Company’s business.  The Company operates its business and markets its products internationally.  The Company’s foreign operations are subject to the risks described above, as well as risks related to fluctuations in currency values, foreign currency exchange controls, compliance with foreign laws, compliance with applicable U.S. laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other economic or political uncertainties.  International sales are subject to risks related to general economic conditions, imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other restrictions, enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and compliance with applicable foreign laws, and other economic and political uncertainties.  All of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial results.The Company may be adversely impacted if the Company is unable to protect information technology systems against, or effectively respond to, cyber-attacks or security breaches.  Information technology systems are an important part of the Company’s business operations. Attempted cyber-attacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise.  In an attempt to mitigate this risk, the Company has implemented and continues to evaluate security initiatives and business continuity plans.Deterioration of labor relations or increases in labor costs could harm the Company’s business.  As of October 28, 2018, the Company had approximately 20,100 employees worldwide, of which approximately 4,450 were represented by labor unions, principally the United Food and Commercial Workers Union.  A significant increase in labor costs or a deterioration of labor relations at any of the Company’s facilities or contracted hog processing facilities resulting in work slowdowns or stoppages could harm the Company’s financial results.  Union contracts at the Company's facilities in Algona, Iowa; Atlanta, Georgia; Austin, Minnesota; and Beloit, Wisconsin will expire during fiscal 2019, covering approximately 2,300 employees.  Negotiations have not yet been initiated"

Hormel in 1891 in Austin, Minnesota, asGeorge A. Hormel & Company.  TheCompany started as a processor of meat and food products and continues in thisline of business.  The Company name waschanged to Hormel Foods Corporation on January 31, 1995.  The Company is primarily engaged in theproduction of a variety of meat and food products and the marketing of thoseproducts throughout the United States and internationally.  Although pork and turkey remain the major rawmaterials for its products, the Company has emphasized for several years themanufacturing and distribution of branded, value-added consumer items ratherthan the commodity fresh meat business. The Company has continually expanded its product portfolio throughorganic growth, new product development, and acquisitions. Internationally, the Company markets its productsthrough Hormel Foods International Corporation (HFIC), a wholly ownedsubsidiary.  HFIC has a presence in theinternational marketplace through joint ventures and placement of personnel instrategic foreign locations such as Australia, Canada, China, Japan, and thePhilippines.  HFIC also has a globalpresence with minority positions in food companies in Mexico (Hormel Alimentos,50% holding) and the Philippines (Purefoods-Hormel, 40% holding), and in a hogproduction and processing operation in Vietnam (San Miguel Purefoods (Vietnam)Co. Ltd., 49% holding). On October 26,2009, subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, the Company also completed theformation of MegaMex Foods, LLC, a joint venture which will market Mexicanfoods in the United States.  The Companywill have a 50 percent ownership interest in this joint venture, and theinvestment will be included in the Companys Grocery Products segment. The Company has not been involved in any bankruptcy,receivership, or similar proceedings during its history.  Substantially all of the assets of theCompany have been acquired in the ordinary course of business. The Company had no significant change in the type ofproducts produced or services rendered, or in the markets or methods ofdistribution since the beginning of the 2009 fiscal year. (b)  Segments The Companys businessis reported in five segments: Grocery Products, Refrigerated Foods, Jennie-OTurkey Store (JOTS), Specialty Foods, and All Other.  Net sales to unaffiliated customers andoperating profit, and the presentation of certain other financial informationby segment, are reported in Note L of the Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements and in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations of the Annual Stockholders Report for thefiscal year ended October 25, 2009, incorporated herein by reference. (c)  Description of Business Products and Distribution The Companys products primarily consist of meat andother food products.  The meat productsare sold fresh, frozen, cured, smoked, cooked, and canned.  The percentages of total revenues contributedby classes of similar products for the last three fiscal years of the Companyare as follows:   Fiscal Year Ended   October 25, 2009 October 26, 2008 October 28, 2007 Perishable meat 53.9%53.5%54.2%Poultry 19.3 19.2 19.2 Shelf-stable 17.3 17.1 16.8 Other 9.5 10.2 9.8   100.0%100.0%100.0% Reportingof revenues from external customers is based on similarity of products, as thesame or similar products are sold across multiple distribution channels such asretail, foodservice, or international. Revenues reported are based on financial information used to produce theCompanys general-purpose financial statements. 3Table ofContents Perishable meat includes fresh meats, sausages, hams,wieners, and bacon (excluding JOTS products). The Poultry category is composedprimarily of JOTS products.  Shelf-stableincludes canned luncheon meats, shelf-stable microwaveable entrees, stews,chilies, hash, meat spreads, flour and corn tortillas, salsas, tortilla chips,and other items that do not require refrigeration.  The Other category primarily consists ofnutritional food products and supplements, sugar and sugar substitutes,creamers, salt and pepper products, sauces and salad dressings, dessert anddrink mixes, and industrial gelatin products. Construction of the new production facility inDubuque, Iowa continues, which will provide additional capacity for canned andmicrowave tray items beginning in January 2010.  No other new products in fiscal 2009 requireda material investment of the Companys assets. Domestically, the Company sells its products in all 50states.  The Companys products are soldthrough its sales personnel, operating in assigned territories coordinated fromsales offices located in most of the larger U.S. cities, as well as independentbrokers and distributors.  Dedicatedsales teams also serve major retail customers and coordinate sales of bothGrocery Products and Refrigerated Foods products.  As of October 25, 2009, the Company hadapproximately 662 sales personnel engaged in selling its products.  Distribution of products to customers isprimarily by common carrier. Through HFIC, the Company markets its products invarious locations throughout the world. Some of the larger markets include Australia, Canada, China, England,Japan, Mexico, and Micronesia.  Thedistribution of export sales to customers is by common carrier, while the Chinaoperations own and operate their own delivery system.  The Company, through HFIC, has licensedcompanies to manufacture various Company products internationally on a royaltybasis, with the primary licensees being Tulip International of Denmark and CJCheilJedang Corporation of South Korea. Raw Materials The Company has, for the past several years, beenconcentrating on processed branded products for consumers with year-rounddemand to minimize the seasonal variation experienced with commodity-typeproducts.  Pork continues to be theprimary raw material for Company products. Although the live pork industry has evolved to large, verticallyintegrated, year-round confinement operations, and supply contracts have becomeprevalent in the industry, there is still a seasonal variation in the supply offresh pork materials.  The Companysexpanding line of processed items has reduced, but not eliminated, thesensitivity of Company results to raw material supply and price fluctuations. The majority of the hogs harvested by the Company arepurchased under supply contracts from producers located principally inColorado, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, SouthDakota, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, and Canada. The cost of hogs and the utilization of the Companys facilities areaffected by both the level and the methods of pork production in the UnitedStates.  The movement toward year-roundconfinement operations which operate under supply agreements with processorshas resulted in fewer hogs being available on the spot cash market.  The Company, along with others in theindustry, uses supply contracts to manage the effects of this trend and toensure a stable supply of raw materials. The Company has converted the majority of its contracts to market-basedformulas to better match input costs with customer pricing, and all contractcosts are fully reflected in the Companys reported financial statements.  In fiscal 2009, the Company purchased 93percent of its hogs under supply contracts. The Company also procures a portion of its hogs through farms that iteither owns or operates in Arizona, California, Colorado, Kansas, and Wyoming. In fiscal 2009, JOTS raised turkeys representingapproximately 69 percent of the volume needed to meet its raw materialrequirements for whole bird and processed turkey products.  Turkeys not sourced within the Company arecontracted with independent turkey growers. JOTS turkey-raising farms are located throughout Minnesota andWisconsin. Production costs in raising hogs and turkeys aresubject primarily to fluctuations in feed grain prices and, to a lesser extent,fuel costs.  To manage this risk, theCompany periodically hedges a portion of its anticipated purchases of grainusing futures contracts. Manufacturing The Company has four plants that harvest hogs forprocessing.  Quality Pork Processors, Inc.of Dallas, Texas, operates the harvesting facility at Austin, Minnesota under acustom harvesting arrangement.  TheCompany has six turkey harvest and processing operations, and 40 facilitiesthat produce and distribute other manufactured items.  Albert Lea Select Foods, Inc. operatesthe processing facility at Albert Lea, Minnesota under a custom manufacturingagreement.  Company products are alsocustom manufactured by several other companies. The following are the Companys larger custom manufacturers: SteubenFoods, Jamaica, New York; Lakeside Packing Company, Manitowoc, Wisconsin;Schroeder Milk, Maplewood, Minnesota; Reichel Foods, Rochester, Minnesota;Power Packaging, St. Charles, Illinois; and Tony Downs, St. James,Minnesota.  Power  4Table ofContents Logistics, Inc., based in St. Charles, Illinois,operates distribution centers for the Company in Dayton, Ohio, and Osceola,Iowa. Patents andTrademarks There are numerous patents and trademarks that areimportant to the Companys business.  TheCompany holds 8 foreign and 46 U.S.-issued patents.  Some of the trademarks are registered andsome are not.  Some of the moresignificant owned or licensed trademarks used by the Company or its affiliatesare: HORMEL, ALWAYS TENDER, AMERICAN CLASSICS, AUSTINBLUES, BANGKOK PADANG, BLACK LABEL, BREAD READY, BÚFALO, CAFÉ H,

to pay required maintenance fees.  As long as the Company intends to continueusing its trademarks, they are renewed indefinitely. Customersand Backlog Orders Duringfiscal year 2009, sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (Wal-Mart) representedapproximately 13 percent of the Companys revenues (measured as gross salesless returns and allowances), an increase of one percent from fiscal year2008.  Wal-Mart is a customer for allfive segments of the Company.  The fivelargest customers in each segment make up approximately the followingpercentage of segment sales: 48 percent of Grocery Products, 38 percent of RefrigeratedFoods, 40 percent of JOTS, 40 percent of Specialty Foods, and 31 percent of AllOther.  The loss of one or more of thetop customers in any of these segments could have a material adverse effect onthe results of such segment.  Backlogorders are not significant due to the perishable nature of a large portion ofthe products.  Orders are accepted andshipped on a current basis. Competition Theproduction and sale of meat and food products in the United States andinternationally are highly competitive. The Company competes with manufacturers of pork and turkey products, aswell as national and regional producers of other meat and protein sources, suchas beef, chicken, and fish.  The Companybelieves that its largest domestic competitors for its Refrigerated Foodssegment in 2009 were Tyson Foods, Smithfield Foods, and Sara Lee Corporation;for its Grocery Products segment, ConAgra Foods, General Mills, and CampbellSoup Co.; and for JOTS, Cargill, Inc. and Butterball, LLC. Allsegments compete on the basis of price, product quality, brand identification,and customer service.  Through aggressivemarketing and strong quality assurance programs, the Companys strategy is toprovide higher quality products that possess strong brand recognition, whichwould then support higher value perceptions from customers. TheCompany competes using this same strategy in international markets around theworld. Research and Development Research and development continues to be a vital partof the Companys strategy to extend existing brands and expand into new brandeditems.  The expenditures for research anddevelopment for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, were approximately $25,398,000,$22,689,000, and $21,475,000, respectively.  There are 113 employees engaged in full time research and development,54 in the area of improving existing products and 59 in developing newproducts. Employees As of October 25, 2009, the Company hadapproximately 18,600 active employees. 5Table ofContents (d)  Geographic Areas Financial information about geographic areas,including total revenues attributed to the U.S. and all foreign countries intotal for the last three fiscal years of the Company, is reported in Note L ofthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Annual StockholdersReport for the fiscal year ended October 25, 2009, incorporated herein byreference. (e)  Available Information The Company makes available, free of charge on its Website at www.hormelfoods.com, its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterlyreports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments tothose reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) ofthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These reports are accessible under the Investors caption of theCompanys Web site and are available as soon as reasonably practicable aftersuch material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities andExchange Commission. The documents noted above are also available in print,free of charge, to any stockholder who requests them. (f)  Executive Officers of the Registrant         YEAR        FIRST    CURRENT OFFICE AND PREVIOUS   ELECTEDNAME AGE FIVE YEARS EXPERIENCE DATES OFFICER         Jeffrey M.
