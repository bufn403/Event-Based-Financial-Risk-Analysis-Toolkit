.In evaluating our business, the material risks described below, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission should be considered carefully. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business. The occurrence of any of these events or circumstances could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flow or results of operations. This report contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary statements made under the heading ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" for more information on the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements.Strategic Risks Related to Our Business Our business will suffer if we are not successful in executing our strategy and transformation initiatives.Our strategy focuses on fewer and bigger brands that we believe have the largest potential, while emphasizing bottom-line growth, operational discipline, enhanced focus on our fans and commitment to shareholder return. In mid-2022, we formed the Hasbro Transformation Office (""HTO""), a team of leaders dedicated to designing and running a simple, efficient and effective business aligned with our strategy. The HTO is supporting our Operational Excellence Program, an ongoing enterprise-wide cost savings initiative intended to improve our business through specialized organizational programs that include targeted cost-savings, supply chain transformation and certain other restructuring actions designed to drive growth and enhance shareholder value. There are no assurances that we will achieve these cost savings in the amounts we anticipate or within the anticipated timeframes or at all. In addition, any cost savings that we realize may be offset, in whole or in part, by reductions in net sales or through increases in other expenses. Failure to realize the expected cost savings from these cost savings programs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Failure to execute our strategic plan and transformation initiatives may harm our business. Our ability to successfully implement and execute these plans and initiatives in a timely basis, if at all, is dependent on many factors, including, among other things:  •our ability to successfully innovate, design, develop, price, commercialize and grow a select group of brands across our Blueprint to global consumers in a wide array of markets; •our ability to successfully grow our digital gaming business;•our ability to optimize our toy business, including through right-sizing our cost structure and creating efficiencies in our operations; •our ability to implement appropriate systems and processes to obtain and analyze data and insights from consumers to enable us to make informed decisions about priorities and consumer preferences;•our ability to gain market share in our focus categories;•our ability to simplify our supply chain logistics;•our ability to successfully manage inventory; •the ability of our workforce to focus and execute on priority transformational projects across the business, and to sustain changes to maximize savings; •the attraction and retention of key personnel with core skills and competencies in the areas of focus; and•our ability to successfully license, divest, sell, or otherwise cease certain parts of the business that are not as profitable as other areas or are not core to the business.Consumer interests change rapidly and acceptance of products and entertainment offerings are influenced by outside factors, making it difficult to design and develop innovative products, play patterns and entertainment offerings which are and will continue to be popular with children, families and audiences.Central to our mission is to Create Magic Through Play. This means we need to design innovative toys and games that create memorable, social and collectible experiences of play and entertainment. Our ability to successfully create innovative toys and games is affected by the interests of children, families, fans and audiences evolve quickly and can change dramatically from year to year and by geography. To be successful, we must correctly 26Table of Contentsanticipate the types of products, play patterns and entertainment which will capture consumers’ interests and imagination, and quickly develop and introduce innovative products and engaging entertainment which can compete successfully for consumers’ limited time, attention and spending. Although we utilize our brand insights platform to gather data and analytics to help us make informed decisions, it is very difficult to predict consumer acceptance with certainty due to, among other things, the ever-increasing utilization of technology at younger and younger ages, social media and digital media in entertainment offerings, and the increasing breadth of products and entertainment available to consumers. Evolving consumer tastes and shifting interests, coupled with an ever-changing and expanding pipeline of products, technology and entertainment which compete for consumer interest and acceptance, create an environment in which some products, technology and entertainment offerings can fail to achieve consumer acceptance or can be popular during a certain period of time but then be rapidly replaced. As a result, our products and entertainment offerings can have short consumer life cycles with no guarantee of success. Consumer acceptance is even more critical for our toy business due to the recent decline in the overall toy industry.Consumer acceptance of our or our partners’ entertainment offerings is also affected by outside factors, such as critical reviews, promotions, the quality and acceptance of films and television programs and content released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions and public tastes generally, all of which could change rapidly and most of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that television programs and films we or our partners develop, produce or distribute will obtain favorable reviews or ratings, that films we develop, produce or distribute will be popular with consumers and perform well at the box office or in other distribution channels, or that broadcasters will license the rights to broadcast any of our television programs in development or renew licenses to broadcast programs in our library.If we devote time and resources to developing and marketing products or entertainment that consumers do not accept, do not find interesting enough to buy in sufficient quantities to be profitable to us or do not purchase due to the pricing of a product, our revenues and profits may decline and our business performance may be harmed. Similarly, if our product offerings and entertainment fail to correctly anticipate consumer interests, our revenues and earnings will be reduced.Our business will suffer if we are unable to innovate, develop  and invest in digital gaming.A key component to the success of our strategy is to continue to innovate, develop and invest in digital gaming, particularly through our Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming business. We have invested substantially in this business and as a result it has seen significant growth over the past several years. Continued digital game development is a key growth factor for the future, including AAA games, games as a service and licensed games. If we are unable to continue to grow this business and ensure its integration with our other business segments, our business may be harmed. The digital gaming industry is highly competitive, including for talent, and costs associated with designing, developing and producing digital games and technologically advanced or sophisticated products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products, such as board and trading card games and action figures, with no assurance of success. As a result, we face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs and we may lose money on the development and sale of these products. Additionally, designing, developing and producing digital gaming and other technologically advanced or innovative products often relies on third parties and requires different competencies and follows different timelines than traditional toys and games. Delays in the design, development or production of our digital gaming products could have a significant impact on our success. In addition, the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than for our other products and this pace of change is expected to accelerate as artificial intelligence is further incorporated into the development of games. If a digital game fails to gain consumer acceptance early in its life cycle, there are limited opportunities to gain such acceptance through secondary launches or distribution through alternative platforms. This pace of change or lack of consumer acceptance means that the window in which a digital gaming product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games.If we fail to respond to or capitalize on the rapid technological development in the entertainment industry, including changes in entertainment delivery formats, our business could be harmed.The entertainment industry continues to experience frequent change driven by technological development and audience viewing preferences, including developments with respect to the formats through which films, television programming, and other episodic content are delivered to consumers. With rapid technological changes and expanded digital content offerings, the scale and scope of these changes have accelerated in recent years. Consumers are continuing to increase their access to television, film and other episodic content on streaming and digital content networks. Similarly, some film releases go direct to streaming channels as opposed to theaters or at the same time as theaters or have gone to streaming channels after only a short period of time in the theaters. 27Table of ContentsTechnological as well as other trends in the industry have caused significant disruption to the retail distribution of entertainment offerings and have caused, and could in the future cause, a negative impact on sales of our products and other forms of monetization of content, especially those which are reliant on box office success. We may lose opportunities to capitalize on changing market dynamics, technological innovations or consumer tastes if we do not adapt to such changes in a timely manner. The overall effect that technological development and new digital distribution platforms have on the revenue and profits we derive from our entertainment content, including from merchandise sales derived from such content, and the additional costs associated with changing markets, media platforms and technologies, is unpredictable. If we fail to accurately assess and effectively respond to changes in technology and consumer behavior in the entertainment industry, our business may be harmed.The industries in which we compete are highly competitive. If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our revenues, market share and profitability could decline.The play industry is highly competitive. We compete in the U.S. and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers, marketers, and sellers of toys and games, products which combine traditional and digital play, digital gaming products, and other consumer products, as well as with retailers who offer such products under their own private labels often at lower prices. In addition, we compete with companies focused on building their brands across multiple product and consumer categories, including through entertainment offerings. Across our business, we face competitors who are constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends, seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers, and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase.In addition to existing competitors, the barriers to entry for new participants in the play industry are low, and the increasing importance of digital media and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest, has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets, and has broadened the array of companies we compete with. New participants with a popular product idea can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time. These risks will be heightened if the use of artificial intelligence in developing products becomes safer, more accepted and otherwise more broadly adopted. These existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences or may design products that are more desirable than ours. Our competitors’ products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products, lower our revenues and lower our profitability.Our entertainment business, which following the sale of our eOne film and television business is primarily focused on Hasbro and family-oriented content, faces global competition from major film studios and television production companies as well as other independent distributors and independent content producers. Many of these competitors release a large number of content offerings annually and command a significant share of box office revenues, streaming revenues, and television airtime, as well as other independent film and television production or distribution companies. Some of these competitors have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we do and may be able to compete aggressively on pricing in order to increase box office or streaming revenues, obtain distribution rights and obtain television airtime. The competition we face may cause us to lose market share or achieve lower prices for productions based on our intellectual property, which could harm our business.We may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected, if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties or if licenses are not renewed.The success of entertainment properties for which we have a license, such as licenses we have with The Walt Disney Company, and the ability of us to successfully market and sell related products, can significantly affect our revenues and profitability. In some cases, we may only obtain an exclusive license for certain aspects of an IP or for certain territories, which means that some of our competitors also have the right to use the same IP for other categories or in different territories. If we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series, the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering. In addition, competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure, maintain, and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms, if at all, and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design, develop and market successful products based on these properties. If we are unable to realize the full benefit of an important license, or if an important license is not renewed or is otherwise terminated, our business results may be harmed.The license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial, and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual 28Table of Contentssales, which could result in write-offs which, in turn, would harm our results of operations. Acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable, which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal, or not pursuing certain new licenses. Additionally, as a licensee of entertainment-based properties, we cannot guarantee that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy, game or other family entertainment products, and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us.We may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, dispositions or investments in joint ventures, or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization.We cannot be certain that the products and offerings of companies we may acquire, or acquire an interest in, will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products, develop our competencies or grow our business. In some cases, we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production, marketing and other operating, revenue or cost synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and, where applicable, cost savings, operating efficiencies and other advantages. However, we cannot be certain that these synergies, efficiencies and cost savings will be realized. Even if achieved, these benefits may be delayed, reduced or short-lived in their realization. In other cases, we may acquire or invest in companies that we believe have strong and creative management, in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations. We cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products, entertainment or services in the future. Acquisitions of businesses and brands could also be adversely affected by changes in our business strategy or external factors. For example, with our Blueprint strategy, we determined to sell, license or otherwise dispose of certain non-core assets, such as the recently completed sale of eOne Film and TV to Lionsgate. We cannot guarantee that any acquisition, disposition or investment we may make will be successful or beneficial, and acquisitions, dispositions and investments can consume significant amounts of management attention and other resources, which may negatively impact other aspects of our business.Operational Risks Related to our BusinessIf we are not successful in transforming our supply chain operations, our business may be harmed.As part of our transformation efforts, we are continuing to optimize our supply chain by improving our systems and sourcing to enable efficient product deployment, enhance product quality and safety, drive efficiency in transportation and our fulfillment centers, and strengthen our direct-to-consumer operations. This is a long-term project, with no assurance that we will achieve the anticipated efficiencies and benefits from such efforts. If the transformation of our supply chain operations is not successful, our business may be harmed. Further we may not achieve our anticipated cost savings, and we may face costly inefficiencies or other supply chain disruptions.An inability to develop, introduce and ship planned products, product lines and new brands in a timely and cost-effective manner could result in excess inventory, a shortage of products or otherwise damage our business.In developing products, product lines and new brands we have anticipated dates for the associated product and brand introductions. When we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a particular product, product line or brand at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development, implementation, and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule. If we do not have in place, appropriate systems and technology, or do not obtain sufficient data, analytics and insights, we may not be able to adequately predict demand for our products. If we fail to accurately forecast demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers. Inventory levels in excess of demand have in the past resulted in, and may in the future result in, inventory write-downs or write-offs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices or through less preferred distribution channels, which could harm our profit margins. If we do not operate our supply chain in an effective manner, we will not be able to manufacture, source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a cost-effective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands. This risk is heightened by our customers’ compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business. The risk is also exacerbated by the increasing sophistication of many of the brands and products we are designing and developing in terms of combining digital and traditional technologies, and providing greater innovation and product differentiation. Unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process, significant increases in the planned cost of development, or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated, may reduce or eliminate the profitability of such 29Table of Contentsproducts, result in excess inventory, or, in some situations, may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued.If we are unable to navigate through global supply chain challenges, our business may be harmed.In recent years, we faced global supply chain challenges with the production and delivery of some products being delayed due to logistics, including labor, trucking and container shortages, port congestion and other shipping disruptions. We experienced increases in material costs and shortages for some of our products, due in part to higher wages being paid due to labor shortages in China and Vietnam, as well as periodic and unpredictable manufacturing shut-downs or slow-downs due to COVID-19. While we have taken actions to lessen the impact of these supply chain challenges, such as through the use of alternative ports and air freight, and accelerating inventory purchases in certain cases to ensure product availability for customers, such actions have resulted in higher costs and there can be no assurance that the actions taken will be effective. We have also increased prices in some cases to help offset increased costs. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to increase prices in the future and we cannot assure that price increases we have already taken, will offset the entirety of additional costs we have incurred, and may incur in the future to mitigate the supply chain disruption. Further, if we are unable to negotiate favorable carrier agreements, deliver products on time or otherwise satisfy demand for our products, our business may be harmed.If we are unable to adapt our business to the continued shift to direct-to-consumer, our business may be harmed. Part of our strategy is to build lifelong relationships with our consumers through direct-to consumer relationships created through ecommerce, social media, digital games and services. If we are unable to effectively connect with consumer through these channels, or business may be harmed. Similarly, if our technology and systems used to support direct-to-consumer order processing are not effective, our ability to deliver products on time on a cost-effective basis may be adversely affected. Failure to continue to adapt our systems and supply chain and successfully fulfill ecommerce sales could harm our business. The concentration of our customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us.We depend upon a relatively small customer base to sell the majority of our products. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, Walmart, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. each accounted for approximately 11% of our consolidated net revenues. Similarly, sales of certain products of our Wizards business depend in part on the success of specialty hobby stores. Due to our customer concentration and customer base, if one or more of our major customers or specialty hobby stores were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing business with us, significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us, favor competitors or new entrants, increase their direct competition with us by expanding their private-label business, change their purchasing patterns, impose unexpected fees on us, alter the manner in which they promote our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products, or return substantial amounts of our products, our business may be harmed. Our customers do not make binding long-term commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders. Any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products. In addition, increased concentration among our customers could negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers. Furthermore, as we experienced with the bankruptcy of certain of our retailers in the past, the failure or lack of success of a significant retail customer could negatively impact our revenues and profitability.Our substantial business, sales and manufacturing operations outside the U.S. subject us to risks associated with international operations.We operate facilities and sell products and entertainment offerings in numerous countries outside the U.S. Additionally, we utilize third-party manufacturers primarily located in the Far East, including China, Vietnam and India, to produce most of our products. These international operations, including operations in emerging markets, have unique consumer preferences and business climates, present additional challenges and are subject to risks that may significantly harm our sales, increase our costs or otherwise damage our business, including:•Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;30Table of Contents•The imposition of tariffs, trade sanctions, quotas, border adjustment taxes or other protectionist measures;•Potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross-border transactions, which can materially increase our taxes and other costs of doing business; •Political instability, civil unrest and economic instability, such as has recently been experienced between Russia and Ukraine, which has resulted in a suspension of our business activities in Russia;•Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;•Complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies and the evolution of laws and regulations and related enforcement, as such laws and policies relate to our products and approval of entertainment;•Difficulties understanding the retail climate, consumer trends, local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be different from the U.S.;•Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and cost in recovering therefrom; •Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another, including port congestion, strikes, labor shortages and other events causing transportation delays and interruptions;•Increased investment and operational complexity to make our products compatible with systems in various countries and compliant with local laws; and•Changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing business internationally.Because of the importance of international sales, sourcing and manufacturing to our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business and operating in an environment with these risks.Our reliance on third-party manufacturers to produce our products, particularly in China, the U.S., Vietnam and India, presents risks to our business.All our products are manufactured by third-party manufacturers, the majority of which are in China, with a significant amount of our product sourcing also coming from manufacturers the U.S., Vietnam and a lesser amount from India. Should changes be necessary, our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted, over a significant period of time, to alternative sources of supply. Working with vendors who have not historically manufactured products for us means these new vendors must successfully develop the capability to manufacture our products to the quality and safety standards we require and within the tight timeframe required by our customers. Newer and less experienced vendors are more susceptible to product quality, logistics and other issues, due in part to their less mature infrastructure or unfamiliarity with our product standards.If we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product lines due to economic, political, civil, labor or other factors beyond our control, including work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, natural disasters, adverse health conditions or pandemics, our ability to manufacture would be adversely affected and our operations may be substantially disrupted, potentially for a significant period of time. This delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business while alternative sources of supply are secured.Given that our toy and game manufacturing is conducted by third-party manufacturers, health conditions, such as COVID-19, and other factors affecting social and economic activity where our manufacturers are located may affect the movement of people and products into and from those locations to our major markets, including North America and Europe. Further, increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in markets where we manufacture, could also have a significant negative impact on our operations, revenues and earnings. Prolonged disputes or slowdowns at west coast or other ports can negatively impact both the time and cost of transporting goods into the U.S. Natural disasters or health pandemics impacting our manufacturers had and can have a significant negative impact on our business.Further, the imposition of tariffs, border adjustment taxes, trade sanctions or other regulations or economic penalties by the U.S. or the European Union against products imported by us from China or other foreign countries, or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with China or other foreign countries in which we operate, could significantly 31Table of Contentsincrease our cost of products imported into the U.S. or Europe, shift more orders from direct import to domestic sales, put additional shipping and warehousing burdens on us, delay the time of our sales to retailers, result in lost sales, and otherwise harm our business. Additionally, the suspension of the operations of a third-party manufacturer by government inspectors in China or another market in which we source products could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales. We require our third-party manufacturers to comply with our Global Business Ethics Principles, which are designed to prevent products manufactured for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions. Notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them, there is always a risk that one or more of our third-party manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such non-compliance. Any failure of our third-party manufacturers to comply with labor, consumer, product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation, harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us.Our dependence on third-party relationships with studios, content producers and distribution channels to develop and distribute digital games and entertainment content is critical to our business.We rely on third party relationships with studios, content producers and distribution channels to develop and distribute certain digital games and entertainment content. Our financial performance may be adversely affected by our relationships with these studios, content producers and distribution channels. Some of our digital gaming developers and content producers are affiliates of major studios that develop their own games or content. Some have their own distribution capability in the markets in which we operate, and some may decide, or be required by their respective parent companies, to use their intra‑company distribution or content production capabilities rather than contracting with us. Our business may be harmed if the studios, content producers and distribution channels with which we work stop or reduce the amount of work they do with us or otherwise demand less favorable terms to us.If our vendors or third-party outsourcing partners fail to perform, our business may be harmed. As a part of our transformation efforts to reduce costs, achieve operational efficiencies, and increase productivity and service quality, we have relied and expect to further rely on third-party vendor and outsourcing relationships for certain areas of the business. Working with third-parties for these critical areas subjects us to risk, including the reduction in full control over certain activities. Any failure to perform timely or accurately or other shortcoming of one of these vendors or outsourcers, could harm our business or could damage our reputation. Transitioning some of these services to a third-party outsourcing vendor is challenging and time-consuming. Problems with transitioning these services and systems to, or operating failures with, these vendors and outsourcers may cause delays to product sales and reduce the efficiency of our operations. We may not achieve the cost-savings we expect, and we may suffer knowledge loss and require significant capital investments to remediate the problem. We cannot guarantee that our outsourcing efforts will be successful. Our success is dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees.Our officers and employees are at the heart of all our efforts. It is their skill, innovation and hard work that drive our success. We compete with many other potential employers in recruiting, hiring and retaining our management team and our many other skilled officers and employees around the world. In the digital gaming and entertainment industries, experienced personnel and top creative talent are in high demand and competition for their talent is intense. The continuing prevalence of remote and hybrid work creates further challenges in retaining employees as some employees desire more flexibility in their employment and the ability to work remotely or hybrid opens up more employment opportunities. Additionally, as we continue to transform our business to execute on our strategic plan, we have reduced our headcount and may otherwise lose employees due to our decision to eliminate or reduce the amount of work performed relative to non-core aspects of our business and the optimization of our business. The impact of reductions in workforce or failing to retain key employees can be high due to increased risk of loss of important information, key knowledge and relationships, loss of creative talent, lost productivity, hiring and training costs, all of which could result in lower profitability or otherwise harm the business. We cannot guarantee that we will recruit, hire or retain the key personnel we need to succeed.We have experienced significant changes in our leadership in a relatively short period of time, with most key members of executive leadership having been appointed within the past couple of years. Our future success will depend on the leadership of our key executives and their ability to navigate the organization through our transformation efforts. Our loss of key management or other key employees, inability to drive success through our new leaders, or our inability to retain or hire talented people with the skill sets we need for our diverse and changing business, could significantly harm our business.32Table of ContentsIf we fail to develop diverse top talent, we may be unable to compete and our business may be harmed. We promote a diverse and inclusive work environment. To compete successfully, we must continuously develop a diverse group of talented people representative of our fans and customers which we believe will foster new ideas and perspectives that will benefit our business, including through enhanced product innovation. Competition for diverse talent is intense. The recent restructuring changes in our business may make it more difficult to attract and retain diverse talent. We cannot guarantee we will achieve our goals or that our actions will result in expected benefits to our business. Our business may be harmed if we are unable to protect our critical intellectual property rights.Our intellectual property, including our trademarks and tradenames, copyrights, patents, and rights under our license agreements and other agreements that establish our intellectual property rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, is of critical value. We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property in the U.S. and around the world. From time to time, third parties have challenged, and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our intellectual property in the U.S. and around the world. In addition, our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights, as well as the risk of unauthorized third parties copying and distributing our entertainment content or leaking portions of planned entertainment content. We may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. Similarly, third parties may claim ownership over certain aspects of our products, productions or other intellectual property. Our failure to successfully protect our intellectual property rights could significantly harm our business and competitive position.Failure to successfully operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability.We rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications to manage many aspects of our business, including product development, management of our supply chain, sale and delivery of our products, analytics, royalty and financial reporting and various other processes and transactions. As part of our transformation efforts, we are also upgrading some of our technology and systems, and, as described elsewhere, we are relying on the systems of third-party outsourcers for certain critical functions. We are critically dependent on the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems and related back-up systems. These systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, malware and other cybersecurity attacks and breaches, catastrophic events such as hurricanes, fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees or partners. The efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems, including our ability and the ability of our third-party outsourcers to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully. The failure of our information systems or third-party hosted technology to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business, require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability.If our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed.We and our third-party outsourcers and other business partners maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world and in the cloud. This data relates to all aspects of our business, including current and future products and entertainment under development, and also contains certain customer, consumer, supplier, partner and employee data. We and our partners maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data, but notwithstanding such protective measures, there is a risk of intrusion, cyber-attacks or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data. Cyber-attacks continue to increase in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. They are often carried out by motivated, well-resourced, skilled and persistent actors, including nation states, organized crime groups, “hacktivists” and employees or contractors acting with malicious intent. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware and key loggers, ransomware, a denial-of-service attack, a malicious website, artificial intelligence, the use of social engineering and other means to affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our or third-party technology systems and data. Cyber-attacks could also include supply chain attacks, which could cause a delay in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we provide confidential and proprietary information to our third-party outsourcers and business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business. While we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data, and where applicable, that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties, those outsourcers and partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of 33Table of Contentssuch data. The risk of data loss or breaches is heightened during uncertain economic times, changes in business strategy and reductions in workforce. Any compromise of the confidential data of our customers, consumers, suppliers, partners, employees or ourselves, or failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of or damage to this data through breach of our third party outsourcers and other business partners’ information technology systems could substantially disrupt our operations, harm our customers, consumers, employees and other business partners, damage our reputation, violate applicable laws and regulations, subject us to potentially significant costs and liabilities and result in a loss of business that could be material. Global and Economic Risks Relating to our BusinessOutbreaks of communicable infections, diseases, or public health pandemics in the markets in which we and our employees, consumers, customers, partners, licensees, suppliers and manufacturers operate, could substantially harm our business.Outbreaks of communicable infections, diseases or other adverse public health conditions, such as COVID-19, in markets in which we, our employees, consumers, customers, partners, licensees, licensors, suppliers and manufacturers operate, has had and could in the future have a significant negative impact on our business, revenues and profitability. The occurrence of these types of events can result, and in the case of COVID-19 has resulted in, disruptions and damage to our business, due to, among other things:•difficulties in shipping and distributing products due to ongoing port capacity, and labor, shipping container and truck transportation shortages, resulting in higher costs for both ocean and air freight and delays in the availability of products, which can result in delayed sales and in some cases result in lost sales; •disruptions in supply of products, due to closures or reductions in operations at third-party manufacturing facilities across several geographies including, but not limited to, China, Vietnam, India, the United States and Ireland;•adverse sales impact due to changes in consumer purchasing behavior and availability of products to consumers;•uncertain inventory availability or difficulty in anticipating demand, which can result in too little or too much supply at a given time; •interruptions, delays or postponements of entertainment productions and releases; and •challenges of working remotely.Inflation and other adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we and our employees, consumers, customers, suppliers and manufacturers operate could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products, and lower our revenues, margins and profitability.Various economic conditions in the markets in which we, our employees, consumers, customers, suppliers and manufacturers operate, could have a significant negative impact on our revenues, profitability and business. The occurrence of adverse economic conditions can result in manufacturing and other work stoppages, slowdowns and delays; shortages or delays in production or shipment of products or raw materials; delayed or reduced purchases from customers and consumers; and other factors that cause increases in costs or delay in revenues. Inflation, such as what consumers in the U.S. and other economies have recently experienced, can cause significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers, such as gasoline, home heating fuels, or groceries, may reduce household spending on the discretionary products and entertainment we offer. Weakened economic conditions, lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may also significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products and spending on entertainment. Economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks, wars and other conflicts, natural disasters, increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs, or the prospect of such events. Such a weakened economic and business climate, as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate, could harm our revenues and profitability.Our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products, but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit. Rising fuel and raw material prices, due to inflation or otherwise, for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components, increased transportation and shipping costs, and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products, which in turn may reduce our margins, reduce our profitability and harm our business.34Table of ContentsChanges in U.S., global or regional economic conditions could impact discretionary consumer spending and harm our business and financial performance.Our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending in the markets in which we operate. Recessions or even fear or anticipation of recessions, inflation, rising or fluctuating interest rates and mortgage rates, credit crises and other economic downturns, or disruptions in credit markets, in the U.S. and in other markets in which we operate can result in lower levels of economic activity, lower employment levels, less consumer disposable income, and lower consumer confidence. Similarly, reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers, such as their homes or stock market investments, can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power. Any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products and entertainment. This in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability.Financial Risks Relating to our BusinessOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate due to seasonality in our business. Sales of our products are extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from September through December in anticipation of the holiday season. This seasonality for our consumer products business has increased over time, as retailers become more and more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response or just in time inventory management techniques, including the use of automated inventory replenishment programs. Similarly, ecommerce retailers tend to hold less inventory and take inventory closer to the time of sale to consumers than traditional retailers. As a result, customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers, such as us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. While these techniques reduce a retailer’s investment in inventory, they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier. This can also result in our losing significant revenues and earnings if our supply chain is unable to supply product to our customers when they want it. Tariffs can exacerbate this negative impact by causing retailers to shift from direct import to domestic orders, further pressuring our supply chain.The level of inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us. If we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional products to fully meet consumer demand. Additionally, the logistics of supplying more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance. The ability to accurately predict levels of inventory remains challenging in the current economic environment, and, in 2023, resulted in write-offs of excess inventory.Our entertainment business is also subject to variations based on the timing of television, film, streaming and digital content releases or other factors, such as labor or union strikes. Release dates are determined by several factors, including the timing of holiday periods, geographical release dates and competition in the market. In 2023, the development, production and delivery of content was adversely affected by the actors’ and writers’ strikes that occurred during the year, which caused content to be reduced, delayed or, in some case, not completed.This seasonal patterns of our business requires significant use of working capital, mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers. Our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand, resulting in under producing popular items and/or overproducing less popular items, would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations.As a result of the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year, by unforeseen events such as a natural disaster, a terrorist attack, economic shock or pandemic that harms the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events such as labor or union strikes, or delays or other issues in the supply chain, particularly from the Far East, during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season.We have had and may in the future have significant impairment charges that adversely affect our net earnings. Changes in strategy, shifting focus to certain lines of business, lower projections in an area of the business, declines in the profitability of acquired brands or businesses or our decision to reduce our focus or exit these brands or 35Table of Contentsbusinesses, such as certain non-core entertainment assets of the business, has in the past impacted and may in the future impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge. Similarly, declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in a write-down of our goodwill and consequently harm our net earnings. In 2023, we recorded non-cash goodwill and asset impairment charges of $1,307.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. See note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements, of this Form 10-K.Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance.Our global operations mean we transact business in many different jurisdictions with many different currencies. As a result, if the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes, our financial results as reported in U.S. dollars, may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected. In recent years, our sales were adversely impacted due to the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies in territories in which we operate. Similarly, our expenses can be significantly impacted, in U.S. dollar terms, by exchange rates, meaning the profitability of our business in U.S. dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control. Depreciation in key currencies may have a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings as they are reported in U.S. dollars.Our indebtedness may limit our availability of cash, cause us to divert cash to fund debt service payments or make it more difficult to take certain other actions.We incurred significant indebtedness to finance our acquisition of eOne in 2019. While we continue to pay down this indebtedness, including through the use of proceeds from the sale of certain parts of eOne, the increase in our debt service obligations resulting from additional indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In particular, our increased indebtedness could:•make it more difficult and/or costly for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due, particularly during adverse economic and industry conditions, because a decrease in revenues or increase in costs could cause cash flow from operations to be insufficient to make scheduled debt service payments;•require a substantial portion of our available cash to be used for debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of our cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, acquisitions or other strategic opportunities, dividend payments, share repurchases and other general corporate purposes;•result in downgrades in the credit ratings on our indebtedness, which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms or at all (including in order to refinance our other debt), increase the interest rates under our credit facilities and under any new indebtedness we may incur;•make it more difficult for us to raise capital to fund working capital, make capital expenditures, pay dividends, pursue strategic initiatives or for other purposes;•result in higher interest expense, which could be further increased in case of current or future borrowings subject to variable rates of interest;•require that materially adverse terms, conditions or covenants be placed on us under our debt instruments, which could include, for example, limitations on additional borrowings, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock or make investments, any of which could hinder our access to capital markets or our flexibility in the conduct of our business and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse competitive industry conditions; and•jeopardize our ability to pay our indebtedness if our business experienced a severe downturn.If we were unable to obtain or service our other external financings, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome, our business would be harmed.Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our working capital needs, particularly those in the third and fourth quarters, we may rely on our commercial paper program, revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital. We currently have a commercial paper program which, subject to market conditions, and availability under our committed revolving credit facility, allows us to issue up to $1,000.0 million in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a source of working capital funding and liquidity. We 36Table of Contentscannot guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms, or at all, at any given point in time.We also have a revolving credit agreement which provides for a $1,250.0 million committed revolving credit facility. The credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility. These restrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial, operating and strategic flexibility. Non-compliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines, a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations.Not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing, but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing. In times of severe economic downturn and/or distress in the credit markets, it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us. In such a situation, it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities, and it might not be possible to find alternative sources of funding.We also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to time, through the issuance of debt securities. Our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interest rates, and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities. The failure to receive financing on desirable terms, or at all, could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities.If we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance our outstanding debt or face default. We cannot guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms, or at all.Changes in, or differing interpretations of, income tax laws and rules, and changes in our geographic operating results, may impact our effective tax rate.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in various international tax jurisdictions. We also conduct business activities between our operating units in various jurisdictions and we are subject to transfer pricing rules in the countries in which we operate. There is some degree of uncertainty and subjectivity in complying with transfer pricing rules. Our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in, or the interpretation of, tax laws, such as those imposed by the current U.S. administration and other jurisdictions in which we do business, or by changes in the amount of revenue and earnings we derive, or are determined to derive by tax authorities, from jurisdictions with differing tax rates.In addition, we may be subject to tax examinations by federal, state, and international jurisdictions, and these examinations can result in significant tax findings if the tax authorities interpret the application of laws and rules differently than we do or disagree with the intercompany rates we are applying. We assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from tax uncertainties. While we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome of these uncertain tax benefits, or results of possible current or future tax examinations, may differ from our estimates and may have a significant adverse impact on our business and operating results.Governmental and Legal Risks Relating to our BusinessWe are subject to various government regulations, violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business. In addition, we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls, which could harm our business.We are subject to significant government regulations, including, in the U.S., under The Consumer Products Safety Act, The Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and The Flammable Fabrics Act, as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets. In addition, certain of our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration or similar international authorities. Advertising to children is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and a host of other agencies globally, and the collection of information from children under the age of 13 is subject to the provisions of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and other privacy laws around the world. The collection of personally identifiable information from anyone, including adults, is under increasing regulation in many markets, such as the General Data Protection Regulation adopted by the European Union, and data protection laws in the United States 37Table of Contentsand in a number of other counties. While we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts and regulations, we cannot assure you that we will be in compliance and, if we fail to comply with these requirements or other regulations enacted in the future, we could be subject to fines, liabilities or sanctions which could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall. While costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business, the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant. In addition, any product recall, regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm the reputation of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations.As a large multinational corporation, we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world, including antitrust, employment, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, environmental regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition.Failure to achieve our sustainability goals could result in reputational damage. We view sustainability challenges as opportunities to innovate and continuously improve our product design and operational efficiencies. We have set key goals and objectives in this area as described in our business section of this Form 10-K. Our reputation could be damaged if we fail to achieve our sustainability goals, or if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to the production and packaging of our products.We are involved in litigation, arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense.As a large multinational corporation, we are subject to regulatory investigations, litigation and arbitration disputes, including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of products that have been or may be developed by us, claims by third parties that our products infringe upon or misuse such third parties’ property or rights, claims by former employees for employment related matters or claims relating to media content. Because the outcome of litigation, arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant cost for us and harm our business. The fact that we operate in a significant number of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements. Any successful claim against us could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations"
7,HAS,HASBRO INC,2023-02-22,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
.In evaluating our business, the material risks described below, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission should be considered carefully. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business. The occurrence of any of these events or circumstances could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flow or results of operations. This report contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary statements made under the heading ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" for more information on the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements.Strategic Risks Related to Our Business Our business will suffer if we are not successful in executing our Blueprint 2.0 strategy and transformation initiatives.Our Blueprint 2.0 strategy focuses on fewer and bigger brands that we believe have the largest potential, while emphasizing bottom-line growth, operational discipline, enhanced focus on our fans and commitment to shareholder return. To support our strategy, in mid-2022, we formed the Hasbro Transformation Office (""HTO""), a team of leaders dedicated to designing and running a simple, efficient and effective business aligned with our Blueprint 2.0 strategy. The HTO is supporting our Operational Excellence Program to deliver $250-$300 million in annual run-rate cost savings by year-end 2025. There are no assurances that we will achieve these cost savings.Failure to execute our strategic plan and transformation initiatives may harm our business. Our ability to successfully implement and execute these plans and initiatives in a timely basis, if at all, is dependent on many factors, including, among other things:  •our ability to successfully innovate, design, develop, price, commercialize and grow a select group of brands across our Blueprint 2.0 to global consumers in a wide array of markets; •our ability to successfully grow our digital gaming and direct-to-consumer businesses;•our ability to obtain and analyze data and insights from consumers to enable us to make informed decisions about priorities and consumer preferences;•our ability to gain market share in focus categories: Action Figures & Accessories; Arts & Crafts; Games; Outdoor & Sports; Preschool Toys;•our ability to simplify our supply chain logistics and manage inventory; •the ability of our workforce to focus and execute on priority transformational projects across the business; •the attraction and retention of key personnel with core skills and competencies in the areas of focus, including in tabletop and digital gaming, consumer products and entertainment focused on Hasbro IP; •our ability to successfully license, divest, sell, or otherwise cease certain parts of the business that are not as profitable as other areas or are not core to the business, such as certain film and television assets of eOne; and•the other risks identified in this report.Consumer interests change rapidly and acceptance of products and entertainment offerings are influenced by outside factors, making it difficult to design and develop products, play patterns and entertainment offerings which are and will continue to be popular with children, families and audiences.The interests of children, families, fans and audiences evolve quickly and can change dramatically from year to year and by geography. To be successful, we must correctly anticipate the types of products (including toys, games, collectibles and technologically advanced and digital games), play patterns and entertainment which will capture consumers’ interests and imagination, and quickly develop and introduce innovative products and engaging entertainment which can compete successfully for consumers’ limited time, attention and spending. Although we utilize our brand insights platform to gather data and analytics to help us make informed decisions, it is very difficult to predict consumer acceptance with certainty due to, among other things, the ever-increasing utilization of technology at younger and younger ages, social media and digital media in entertainment offerings, and the 28Table of Contentsincreasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers. Evolving consumer tastes and shifting interests, coupled with an ever-changing and expanding pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for consumer interest and acceptance, create an environment in which some products and entertainment offerings can fail to achieve consumer acceptance, and other products and entertainment offerings can be popular during a certain period of time but then be rapidly replaced. As a result, our products and entertainment offerings can have short consumer life cycles.Consumer acceptance of our or our partners’ entertainment offerings is also affected by outside factors, such as critical reviews, promotions, the quality and acceptance of films and television programs and content released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions and public tastes generally, all of which could change rapidly and most of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that television programs and films we produce or distribute will obtain favorable reviews or ratings, that films we produce or distribute will be popular with consumers and perform well at the box office or in other distribution channels, or that broadcasters will license the rights to broadcast any of our television programs in development or renew licenses to broadcast programs in our library.If we devote time and resources to developing and marketing products or entertainment that consumers do not accept, do not find interesting enough to buy in sufficient quantities to be profitable to us or do not purchase due to the pricing of a product, our revenues and profits may decline and our business performance may be harmed. Similarly, if our product offerings and entertainment fail to correctly anticipate consumer interests, our revenues and earnings will be reduced.Our business will suffer if we are unable to develop digital and technologically advanced and innovative products.A key component to the success of our Blueprint 2.0 strategy is to continue to innovate, develop and invest in digital gaming and technologically advanced and innovative products, particularly through our Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming business. We have invested substantially in this business segment and as a result it has seen significant growth over the past several years, and while primarily through growth in tabletop play, continued digital game development is a key growth factor for the future. If we are unable to continue to grow this business and ensure its integration with our other business segments, our business may be harmed. The digital gaming industry is highly competitive, including for talent, and costs associated with designing, developing and producing digital games and technologically advanced or sophisticated products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products, such as board and trading card games and action figures, with no assurance of success. As a result, we face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs and we may lose money on the development and sale of these products. Additionally, designing, developing and producing digital and technologically advanced or innovative products often relies on third parties and requires different competencies and follows different timelines than traditional toys and games. Delays in the design, development or production of our products could have a significant impact on our success. In addition, the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than for our other products. If a digital game fails to gain consumer acceptance early in its life cycle, there are limited opportunities to gain such acceptance through secondary launches or distribution through alternative platforms. This pace of change or lack of consumer acceptance means that the window in which a digital gaming product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games.If we fail to respond to or capitalize on the rapid technological development in the entertainment industry, including changes in entertainment delivery formats, our business could be harmed.The entertainment industry continues to experience frequent change driven by technological development and audience viewing preferences, including developments with respect to the formats through which films, television programming, and other episodic content are delivered to consumers. With rapid technological changes and dramatically expanded digital content offerings, the scale and scope of these changes have accelerated in recent years. For example, consumers are continuing to increase their access to television, film and other episodic content on streaming and digital content networks, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Disney+, Apple TV+ and Paramount + to name a few. Similarly, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, some film releases continue to go direct to streaming channels as opposed to theaters or at the same time as theaters or have gone to streaming channels after only a short period of time in the theaters. Technological as well as other changes caused by the pandemic have caused significant disruption to the retail distribution of entertainment offerings and have caused, and could in the future cause, a negative impact on sales of our products and other forms of monetization of content, especially those which are reliant on box office success. We may lose opportunities to capitalize on changing market dynamics, technological innovations or consumer tastes if we do not adapt our content offerings or distribution capabilities in a timely manner. The overall effect that technological development and new digital 29Table of Contentsdistribution platforms have on the revenue and profits we derive from our entertainment content, including from merchandise sales derived from such content, and the additional costs associated with changing markets, media platforms and technologies, is unpredictable. If we fail to accurately assess and effectively respond to changes in technology and consumer behavior in the entertainment industry, our business may be harmed.The industries in which we compete are highly competitive. If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our revenues, market share and profitability could decline.The play and entertainment industries are highly competitive. We compete in the U.S. and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers, marketers, and sellers of toys and games, products which combine traditional and digital play, digital gaming products, and other entertainment and consumer products, as well as with retailers who offer such products under their own private labels often at lower prices. In addition, we compete with companies focused on building their brands across multiple product and consumer categories, including through entertainment offerings. Across our business, we face competitors who are constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends, seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers, and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase.In addition to existing competitors, the barriers to entry for new participants in the play and entertainment industry are low, and the increasing importance of digital media and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest, has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets, and has broadened the array of companies we compete with. New participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time. These existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences or may design products that are more desirable than ours. Our competitors’ products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products, lower our revenues and lower our profitability.Our entertainment business faces global competition from major film studios and television production companies as well as other independent distributors and independent content producers. Many of these competitors release a large number of films annually and command a significant share of box office revenues, streaming revenues, and television airtime, as well as other independent film and television production or distribution companies. Some of these competitors have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we do and may be able to compete aggressively on pricing in order to increase box office or streaming revenues, obtain distribution rights and obtain television airtime. In addition, the resources of the major studios may give them an advantage in acquiring other businesses or assets, including content libraries, that we might also be interested in acquiring. The competition we face may cause us to lose market share, achieve lower prices for our productions or pay more for third‑party content, any of which could harm our business.We may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties.The success of entertainment properties for which we have a license, such as licenses we have with The Walt Disney Company, and the ability of us to successfully market and sell related products, can significantly affect our revenues and profitability. In some cases, we may only obtain an exclusive license for certain aspects of an IP or for certain territories, which means that some of our competitors also have the right to use the same IP for other categories or in different territories. If we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series, the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering. In addition, competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure, maintain, and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms, if at all, and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design, develop and market successful products based on these properties.The license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial, and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales, which could result in write-offs which, in turn, would harm our results of operations. Acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable, which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal, or not pursuing certain new licenses. Additionally, as a licensee of entertainment-based properties, we cannot guarantee that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy, game or other family entertainment products, and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us.30Table of ContentsWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, dispositions or investments in joint ventures, or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization.We cannot be certain that the products and offerings of companies we may acquire, or acquire an interest in, will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products, develop our competencies or grow our business. In some cases, we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production, marketing and other operating, revenue or cost synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and, where applicable, cost savings, operating efficiencies and other advantages. However, we cannot be certain that these synergies, efficiencies and cost savings will be realized. Even if achieved, these benefits may be delayed, reduced or short-lived in their realization. In other cases, we may acquire or invest in companies that we believe have strong and creative management, in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations. We cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products, entertainment or services in the future. Acquisitions of businesses and brands could also be adversely affected by changes in our business strategy. With our Blueprint 2.0 strategy, we may seek to sell, license or otherwise dispose of certain non-core assets, such as certain film and television assets. We may not achieve a successful sale, license or disposition of non-core assets. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that any acquisition, disposition or investment we may make will be successful or beneficial, and acquisitions, dispositions and investments can consume significant amounts of management attention and other resources, which may negatively impact other aspects of our business.Operational Risks Related to our BusinessIf we are not successful in transforming our supply chain operations, our business may be harmed.As part of our transformation efforts, we are in the process of optimizing our supply chain by improving our systems and sourcing to enable efficient product deployment, enhance product quality and safety, drive efficiency in transportation and our fulfilment centers, and strengthen our direct-to-consumer operations. This is a long-term project, with no assurance that we will achieve the anticipated efficiencies and benefits from such efforts. If the transformation of our supply chain operations is not successful, our business may be harmed. Further we may not achieve our anticipated cost savings, and we may face costly inefficiencies or other supply chain disruptions.An inability to develop, introduce and ship planned products, product lines and new brands in a timely and cost-effective manner may damage our business.In developing products, product lines and new brands we have anticipated dates for the associated product and brand introductions. When we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a particular product, product line or brand at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development, implementation, and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to manufacture, source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a cost-effective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands. This risk is heightened by our customers’ compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business. The risk is also exacerbated by the increasing sophistication of many of the brands and products we are designing and developing in terms of combining digital and traditional technologies, and providing greater innovation and product differentiation. Unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process, significant increases in the planned cost of development, or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated, may reduce or eliminate the profitability of such products, result in excess inventory, or, in some situations, may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued.If we are unable to navigate through global supply chain challenges, our business may be harmed.During the past couple of years, we have faced global supply chain challenges with the production and delivery of some products being delayed due to logistics, including labor, trucking and container shortages, port congestion and other shipping disruptions. We have experienced increases in material costs and shortages for some of our products, due in part to higher wages being paid due to labor shortages in China and Vietnam, as well as periodic and unpredictable manufacturing shut-downs or slow-downs due to COVID-19. While we have taken actions to lessen the impact of these supply chain challenges, such as through the use of alternative ports and air freight, and accelerating inventory purchases in certain cases to ensure product availability for customers, such actions have resulted in higher costs and there can be no assurance that the actions taken will be effective. We have also increased prices in some cases to help offset increased costs. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to 31Table of Contentsincrease prices in the future and we cannot assure that price increases we have already taken, will offset the entirety of additional costs we have incurred, and may incur in the future to mitigate the supply chain disruption. Further, if we are unable to negotiate favorable carrier agreements, deliver products on time or otherwise satisfy demand for our products, our business may be harmed.If we are unable to adapt our business to the continued shift to ecommerce and direct-to-consumer, our business may be harmed. Our ecommerce business, including through our direct-to-consumer ecommerce, fan-based platform PULSE, is accounting for a higher portion of the ultimate sales of our products to consumers than it has historically. In recent years, the increase in ecommerce sales has resulted in retailers holding less inventory, which has caused us to adjust our supply chain. If our technology and systems used to support ecommerce order processing, including through PULSE, are not effective, our ability to deliver products on time on a cost-effective basis may be adversely affected. Failure to continue to adapt our systems and supply chain and successfully fulfill ecommerce sales could harm our business. In 2022, ecommerce sales were adversely affected as more customers increased their willingness to shop in brick and mortar stores.The concentration of our retail customer base and continued shift to ecommerce sales means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us.We depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products. For the fiscal year ended December 25, 2022, Walmart, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. accounted for approximately 11% and 10%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenues. Similarly, sales of certain products of our Wizards business depend in part on the success of specialty hobby stores. Due to our customer concentration and customer base, if one or more of our major customers or specialty hobby stores were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing business with us, significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us, favor competitors or new entrants, increase their direct competition with us by expanding their private-label business, change their purchasing patterns, impose unexpected fees on us, alter the manner in which they promote our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products, or return substantial amounts of our products, our business may be harmed. Our customers do not make binding long-term commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders. Any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products. In addition, increased concentration among our customers could negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers. Furthermore, as we experienced with the bankruptcy of certain of our retailers in the past, the failure or lack of success of a significant retail customer could negatively impact our revenues and profitability.Our substantial business, sales and manufacturing operations outside the U.S. subject us to risks associated with international operations.We operate facilities and sell products and entertainment offerings in numerous countries outside the U.S. Additionally, we utilize third-party manufacturers primarily located in the Far East, including China, Vietnam and India, to produce most of our products. These international operations, including operations in emerging markets, have unique consumer preferences and business climates, present additional challenges and are subject to risks that may significantly harm our sales, increase our costs or otherwise damage our business, including:•Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;•The imposition of tariffs, quotas, border adjustment taxes or other protectionist measures;•Potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross-border transactions, which can materially increase our taxes and other costs of doing business; •Political instability, civil unrest and economic instability, such as has been experienced between Russia and Ukraine, which has resulted in a suspension of our business activities in Russia;•Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;32Table of Contents•Complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies and the evolution of laws and regulations and related enforcement, as such laws and policies relate to our products and approval of entertainment;•Difficulties understanding the retail climate, consumer trends, local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be quite different from the U.S.;•Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and cost in recovering therefrom; •Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another, including port congestion, strikes, labor shortages and other events causing transportation delays and interruptions;•Increased investment and operational complexity to make our products compatible with systems in various countries and compliant with local laws; and•Changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing business internationally.Because of the importance of international sales, sourcing and manufacturing to our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business and operating in an environment with these risks.Our reliance on third-party manufacturers to produce our products, particularly in China, the U.S., Vietnam and India, presents risks to our business.All our products are manufactured by third-party manufacturers, the majority of which are in China, with a significant amount of our product sourcing also coming from manufacturers the U.S., Vietnam and a lesser amount from India. Should changes be necessary, our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted, over a significant period of time, to alternative sources of supply. If we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product lines due to economic, political, civil, labor or other factors beyond our control, including work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, natural disasters, adverse health conditions or pandemics, our ability to manufacture would be adversely affected and our operations may be substantially disrupted, potentially for a significant period of time. This delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business while alternative sources of supply are secured.Given that our toy and game manufacturing is conducted by third-party manufacturers, health conditions, such as the coronavirus, and other factors affecting social and economic activity where our manufacturers are located may affect the movement of people and products into and from those locations to our major markets, including North America and Europe. Further, increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in markets where we manufacture, could also have a significant negative impact on our operations, revenues and earnings. Prolonged disputes or slowdowns at west coast or other ports can negatively impact both the time and cost of transporting goods into the U.S. Natural disasters or health pandemics, such as COVID-19, impacting our manufacturers had and can have a significant negative impact on our business.Further, the imposition of tariffs, border adjustment taxes, trade sanctions or other regulations or economic penalties by the U.S. or the European Union against products imported by us from China or other foreign countries, or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with China or other foreign countries in which we operate, could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the U.S. or Europe, shift more orders from direct import to domestic sales, put additional shipping and warehousing burdens on us, delay the time of our sales to retailers, result in lost sales, and otherwise harm our business. Additionally, the suspension of the operations of a third-party manufacturer by government inspectors in China or another market in which we source products could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales.We have been working over the last several years to reduce our reliance on manufacturing in China, such as by moving production of certain products to facilities in other countries like Vietnam, India and Mexico, as well as by increasing production of our products in other markets, including in the U.S. We plan to continue those efforts in future years, but cannot guarantee we will be as successful in these efforts as we plan. Furthermore, many of these newer production facilities, such as in Vietnam and India, raise other risks in that we are working with vendors who have not been manufacturing products like ours for as long as historical vendors in China. That means these new vendors must successfully develop the capability to manufacture our products to the quality and safety standards we require and within the tight timeframe required by our customers. Newer and less experienced vendors are more 33Table of Contentssusceptible to product quality, logistics and other issues, due in part to their less mature infrastructure or unfamiliarity with our product standards. We require our third-party manufacturers to comply with our Global Business Ethics Principles, which are designed to prevent products manufactured for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions. Notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them, there is always a risk that one or more of our third-party manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such non-compliance. Any failure of our third-party manufacturers to comply with labor, consumer, product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation, harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us.Our dependence on third-party relationships with studios, content producers and distribution channels to develop and distribute digital games and entertainment content is critical to our business.We rely on third party relationships with studios, content producers and distribution channels to develop and distribute certain digital games and entertainment content. Our financial performance may be adversely affected by our relationships with these studios, content producers and distribution channels. Some of our content producers and digital gaming developers are affiliates of major studios that develop their own content or games. Some have their own distribution capability in the markets in which we operate, and some may decide, or be required by their respective parent companies, to use their intra‑company distribution or content production capabilities rather than contracting with us. Our business may be harmed if the studios, content producers and distribution channels with which we work stop or reduce the amount of work they do with us or otherwise demand less favorable terms to us.We have entered into long-term output licensing agreements for the acquisition of content and these agreements may not be renewed on favorable terms or at all.In some cases, we have entered into long-term agreements to acquire films with producers. These agreements require us to pay for films released by the relevant studio at rates typically calculated by reference to the film’s budget. In addition, we have entered into long term contracts for the acquisition of certain of our television programs. As these contracts expire, we may choose to renew, renegotiate or terminate them. These arrangements are also terminable by the counterparty under certain circumstances. If we are unable to renew or replace them on acceptable terms, we may not be able to replace this content with other film acquisitions. Even if these contracts are renewed or replaced, the terms on which we acquire content may be less favorable than the terms of our current agreements and the financial success or quantity of films and television programs we acquire through these long-term contracts may decrease. There can also be no assurance that revenues based on these long-term contracts will exceed the costs of acquiring the films or television programs. Our success is dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees.Our officers and employees are at the heart of all our efforts. It is their skill, innovation and hard work that drive our success. We compete with many other potential employers in recruiting, hiring and retaining our management team and our many other skilled officers and employees around the world. In the digital gaming and entertainment industries, experienced personnel and top creative talent are in high demand and competition for their talent is intense. The increasing prevalence of remote and hybrid work creates further challenges in retaining employees as some employees desire more flexibility in their employment and the ability to work remotely or hybrid opens up more employment opportunities. Additionally, as we continue to transform our business to execute on our Blueprint 2.0 strategy, we have reduced our headcount and may otherwise lose employees due to our decision to eliminate or reduce the amount of work performed relative to non-core aspects our business. The impact of reductions in force or failing to retain key employees can be high due to increased risk of loss of important information, key knowledge and relationships, loss of creative talent, lost productivity, hiring and training costs, all of which could result in lower profitability or otherwise harm the business. We cannot guarantee that we will recruit, hire or retain the key personnel we need to succeed.We have experienced significant changes in our leadership in a relatively short period of time. This includes the appointments of our new Chief Executive Officer, President of Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming, Global Supply Chain Officer, Chief Commercial Officer, Chief People Officer and Chief Transformation Officer, as well as the expected change in Chief Financial Officer following the upcoming retirement of Deborah Thomas, our current Chief Financial Officer, and the departure of our President and Chief Operating Officer. Our future success will depend on the leadership of our key executives and their ability to navigate the organization through our transformation efforts. Our loss of key management or other key employees, inability to drive success through our new leaders, or our inability to retain or hire talented people with the skill sets we need for our diverse and changing business, could significantly harm our business.34Table of ContentsIf we fail to develop diverse top talent, we may be unable to compete and our business may be harmed. We promote a diverse and inclusive work environment. To compete successfully, we must continuously develop a diverse group of talented people. To that end, we have set goals and objectives with respect to hiring and retention of talented, diverse employees, which we believe will foster new ideas and perspectives that will benefit our business. Competition for diverse talent is intense. The recent restructuring changes in our business may make it more difficult to attract and retain diverse talent. We cannot guarantee we will achieve our goals or that our actions will result in expected benefits to our business. Our business may be harmed if we are unable to protect our critical intellectual property rights.Our intellectual property, including our trademarks and tradenames, copyrights, patents, and rights under our license agreements and other agreements that establish our intellectual property rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, is of critical value. We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property in the U.S. and around the world. From time to time, third parties have challenged, and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our intellectual property in the U.S. and around the world. In addition, our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights, as well as the risk of unauthorized third parties copying and distributing our entertainment content or leaking portions of planned entertainment content. We may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. Similarly, third parties may claim ownership over certain aspects of our products, productions or other intellectual property. Our failure to successfully protect our intellectual property rights could significantly harm our business and competitive position.Failure to successfully operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability.We rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications to manage many aspects of our business, including product development, management of our supply chain, sale and delivery of our products, royalty and financial reporting and various other processes and transactions. As part of our transformation efforts, we are also upgrading some of our technology and systems. We are critically dependent on the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems and related back-up systems. These systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, malware and other cybersecurity breaches, catastrophic events such as hurricanes, fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees or partners. The efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems, including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully. The failure of our information systems or third-party hosted technology to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business, require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability.If our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed.We and our business partners maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world and in the cloud. This data relates to all aspects of our business, including current and future products and entertainment under development, and also contains certain customer, consumer, supplier, partner and employee data. We maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data, but notwithstanding such protective measures, there is a risk of intrusion, cyber-attacks or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data. Cyber-attacks continue to increase in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. They are often carried out by motivated, well-resourced, skilled and persistent actors, including nation states, organized crime groups, “hacktivists” and employees or contractors acting with malicious intent. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware and key loggers, ransomware, a denial-of-service attack, a malicious website, the use of social engineering and other means to affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our technology systems and data. Cyber-attacks could also include supply chain attacks, which could cause a delay in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we provide confidential and proprietary information to our third-party business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business. While we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data, and where applicable, that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties, those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of such data. The risk of data loss or breaches is heightened during uncertain economic times, changes in business strategy and reductions in force. Any compromise of the confidential data of our customers, consumers, suppliers, partners, employees or ourselves, or failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of or damage to this data through breach of our 35Table of Contentsinformation technology systems or other means could substantially disrupt our operations, harm our customers, consumers, employees and other business partners, damage our reputation, violate applicable laws and regulations, subject us to potentially significant costs and liabilities and result in a loss of business that could be material. Global and Economic Risks Relating to our BusinessThe global coronavirus outbreak or other similar outbreaks of communicable infections, diseases, or public health pandemics in the markets in which we and our employees, consumers, customers, partners, licensees, suppliers and manufacturers operate, could substantially harm our business.The global outbreak of the coronavirus which continues to adversely impact global populations, and any other variants or outbreaks of communicable infections, diseases or other adverse public health conditions in markets in which we, our employees, consumers, customers, partners, licensees, licensors, suppliers and manufacturers operate, has had and could in the future have a significant negative impact on our business, revenues and profitability. The occurrence of these types of events can result, and in the case of the coronavirus has resulted in, disruptions and damage to our business, due to, among other things:•difficulties in shipping and distributing products due to ongoing port capacity, and labor, shipping container and truck transportation shortages, resulting in higher costs for both ocean and air freight and delays in the availability of products, which can result in delayed sales and in some cases result in lost sales; •disruptions in supply of products, due to closures or reductions in operations at third-party manufacturing facilities across several geographies including, but not limited to, China, Vietnam, India, the United States and Ireland;•adverse sales impact due to changes in consumer purchasing behavior and availability of products to consumers;•uncertain inventory availability or difficulty in anticipating demand, which can result in too little or too much supply at a given time; •interruptions, delays or postponements of entertainment productions and releases; and •challenges of working remotely. The impact of coronavirus outbreak continues to be fluid and uncertain, and while vaccines have been rolled out, it is still difficult to forecast the final impact it could have on our future operations. If our business experiences prolonged occurrence of adverse public health conditions due to the coronavirus or other similar outbreaks, we believe our business could be substantially harmed.Inflation and other adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we and our employees, consumers, customers, suppliers and manufacturers operate could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products, and lower our revenues, margins and profitability.Various economic conditions in the markets we, our employees, consumers, customers, suppliers and manufacturers operate, could have a significant negative impact on our revenues, profitability and business. The occurrence of adverse economic conditions can result in manufacturing and other work stoppages, slowdowns and delays; shortages or delays in production or shipment of products or raw materials; delayed or reduced purchases from customers and consumers; and other factors that cause increases in costs or delay in revenues. Inflation, such as what consumers in the U.S. and other economies are experiencing, can cause significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers, such as gasoline, home heating fuels, or groceries, may reduce household spending on the discretionary products and entertainment we offer. Weakened economic conditions, lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may also significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products and spending on entertainment. Economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks, wars and other conflicts, natural disasters, increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs, or the prospect of such events. Such a weakened economic and business climate, as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate, could harm our revenues and profitability.Our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products, but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit. Rising fuel and raw material prices, due to inflation or otherwise, for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic 36Table of Contentscomponents, increased transportation and shipping costs, and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products, which in turn may reduce our margins, reduce our profitability and harm our business.Changes in U.S., global or regional economic conditions could impact discretionary consumer spending and harm our business and financial performance.Our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending in the markets in which we operate. Recessions or even fear or anticipation of recessions, inflation, rising interest rates and mortgage rates, credit crises and other economic downturns, or disruptions in credit markets, in the U.S. and in other markets in which we operate can result in lower levels of economic activity, lower employment levels, less consumer disposable income, and lower consumer confidence. Similarly, reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers, such as their homes or stock market investments, can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power. Any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products and entertainment. This in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability.Financial Risks Relating to our BusinessOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate due to seasonality in our business. Sales of our toys, games and other entertainment products are extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from September through December in anticipation of the holiday season. This seasonality for our consumer products business has increased over time, as retailers become more and more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response or just in time inventory management techniques, including the use of automated inventory replenishment programs. Further, ecommerce, including through our own PULSE ecommerce platform, continues to grow significantly and accounts for a higher portion of the ultimate sales of our products to consumers. Third-party ecommerce retailers tend to hold less inventory and take inventory closer to the time of sale to consumers than traditional retailers. As a result, customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers, such as us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. While these techniques reduce a retailer’s investment in inventory, they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier. This can also result in our losing significant revenues and earnings if our supply chain is unable to supply product to our customers when they want it. Tariffs can exacerbate this negative impact by causing retailers to shift from direct import to domestic orders, further pressuring our supply chain.The level of inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us. If we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional products to fully meet consumer demand. Additionally, the logistics of supplying more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance. These risks were exacerbated in 2021 and continued into early 2022 due to the global supply chain challenges we faced due to logistics, including labor, trucking and container shortages, port congestion and other shipping disruptions. To offset the risk of lack of supply, in 2022 we accelerated inventory purchases. These purchases, however, did not see corresponding increases in sales as consumers were impacted by the economic environment, including lower discretionary consumer income due to higher inflation and rising interest rates. The ability to accurately predict levels of inventory remains challenging in the current economic environment.Our entertainment business is also subject to seasonal variations based on the timing of television, film, streaming and digital content releases. Release dates are determined by several factors, including the timing of holiday periods, geographical release dates and competition in the market, and more recently, the timing of release dates has been affected by the pandemic.This seasonal patterns of our business requires significant use of working capital, mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers. Our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand, resulting in under producing popular items and/or overproducing less popular items, would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations.As a result of the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year, by unforeseen events such as a natural disaster, a terrorist attack, economic shock or pandemic that harms the retail environment 37Table of Contentsor consumer buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events such as strikes or port delays or other supply chain challenges that interfere with the shipment of goods, particularly from the Far East, during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season.If we incurred any significant impairment charges, our net earnings would be reduced. Declines in the profitability of acquired brands or businesses or our decision to reduce our focus or exit these brands or businesses, such as certain non-core entertainment assets of the business, may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge. Similarly, declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in a write-down of our goodwill and consequently harm our net earnings. In 2022, we had approximately $322.4 million of impairment charges in connection with the implementation of the Company's strategic review and adoption of the Blueprint 2.0 strategy. These charges consisted of a goodwill impairment loss of $11.8 million and asset impairments of $10.3 million related to the exit of non-core businesses within the Entertainment segment, a charge of $281.0 million related to a partial impairment of the Company's definite-lived Power Rangers intangible asset due to changes in entertainment strategy and plans, incurred incremental asset charges related to product cancellations, consisting of inventory reserves and asset write offs of $14.9 million within the Consumer Products segment, and other strategy related asset impairments of certain discontinued projects of $4.4 million within the Entertainment segment.We may incur impairments if the films and television programs we acquire and produce do not perform well enough to recoup our acquisition, production, marketing and distribution costs.We incur significant costs to acquire, produce and distribute entertainment content. Most agreements to acquire content for distribution require minimum guarantees against royalties. The minimum guarantees are derived from our estimate of net revenues that will be realized from our distribution of the title in the relevant markets, and actual results may differ from those estimates. If sales do not meet our original estimates, we may: •not recognize the expected gross margin or net profit; •not recoup our minimum guarantees or distribution expenses; •record accelerated amortization and/or fair value write‑downs of minimum guarantees paid; or •not recoup the additional funds and expenses invested to market films that we have produced or acquired.With respect to content we produce, we are required to amortize capitalized production costs based on estimated ultimate revenue as we recognize revenues from the associated films or television productions. Unamortized production costs are evaluated for impairment each reporting period on a project‑by‑project basis. If estimated remaining revenue is not sufficient to recover the unamortized production costs, the unamortized production costs will be written down to fair value. In any given quarter, if we lower our previous forecast with respect to total anticipated revenue from any individual film or other project, we may be required to accelerate amortization or record impairment charges with respect to the unamortized costs, even if we have previously recorded impairment charges for such film or other project. Such impairment and accelerated amortization charges and write‑offs could harm our financial results.Similarly, our business could be harmed by greater-than-expected costs, or unexpected delays or difficulties, associated with our investment in Discovery Family Channel, such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or in building advertising revenues for Discovery Family Channel. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2021 we recorded an impairment loss of $74.1 million associated with our investment in the Discovery Family Channel.Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance.Our global operations mean we transact business in many different jurisdictions with many different currencies. As a result, if the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes, our financial results as reported in U.S. dollars, may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected. In 2022, our sales were adversely impacted due to the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies in territories in which we operate. Similarly, our expenses can be significantly impacted, in U.S. dollar terms, by exchange rates, meaning the profitability of our business in U.S. dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control. Depreciation in key currencies may have a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings as they are reported in U.S. dollars.38Table of ContentsOur indebtedness may limit our availability of cash, cause us to divert cash to fund debt service payments or make it more difficult to take certain other actions.We incurred significant indebtedness to finance our acquisition of eOne in 2019. While we continue to pay down this indebtedness, the increase in our debt service obligations resulting from additional indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In particular, our increased indebtedness could:•make it more difficult and/or costly for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due, particularly during adverse economic and industry conditions, because a decrease in revenues or increase in costs could cause cash flow from operations to be insufficient to make scheduled debt service payments;•require a substantial portion of our available cash to be used for debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of our cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, acquisitions or other strategic opportunities, dividend payments, share repurchases and other general corporate purposes;•result in downgrades in the credit ratings on our indebtedness, which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms or at all (including in order to refinance our other debt), increase the interest rates under our credit facilities and under any new indebtedness we may incur;•make it more difficult for us to raise capital to fund working capital, make capital expenditures, pay dividends, pursue strategic initiatives or for other purposes;•result in higher interest expense, which could be further increased in case of current or future borrowings subject to variable rates of interest;•require that materially adverse terms, conditions or covenants be placed on us under our debt instruments, which could include, for example, limitations on additional borrowings or limitations on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock or make investments, any of which could hinder our access to capital markets or our flexibility in the conduct of our business and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse competitive industry conditions; and•jeopardize our ability to pay our indebtedness if our business experienced a severe downturn.If we were unable to obtain or service our other external financings, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome, our business would be harmed.Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our working capital needs, particularly those in the third and fourth quarters, we may rely on our commercial paper program, revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital. We currently have a commercial paper program which, subject to market conditions, and availability under our committed revolving credit facility, allows us to issue up to $1,000.0 million in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a source of working capital funding and liquidity. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms, or at all, at any given point in time.We also have a revolving credit agreement which provides for a $1,500.0 million committed revolving credit facility. The credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility. These restrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial, operating and strategic flexibility. Non-compliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines, a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations.Not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing, but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing. In times of severe economic downturn and/or distress in the credit markets, it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us. In such a situation, it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities, and it might not be possible to find alternative sources of funding.39Table of ContentsWe also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to time, through the issuance of debt securities. Our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interest rates, and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities. The failure to receive financing on desirable terms, or at all, could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities.If we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance our outstanding debt or face default. We cannot guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms, or at all.Changes in, or differing interpretations of, income tax laws and rules, and changes in our geographic operating results, may impact our effective tax rate.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in various international tax jurisdictions. We also conduct business activities between our operating units in various jurisdictions and we are subject to transfer pricing rules in the countries in which we operate. There is some degree of uncertainty and subjectivity in complying with transfer pricing rules. Our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in, or the interpretation of, tax laws, such as those imposed by the current U.S. administration and other jurisdictions in which we do business, or by changes in the amount of revenue and earnings we derive, or are determined to derive by tax authorities, from jurisdictions with differing tax rates.In addition, we may be subject to tax examinations by federal, state, and international jurisdictions, and these examinations can result in significant tax findings if the tax authorities interpret the application of laws and rules differently than we do or disagree with the intercompany rates we are applying. We assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from tax uncertainties. While we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome of these uncertain tax benefits, or results of possible current or future tax examinations, may differ from our estimates and may have a significant adverse impact on our business and operating results.If we lose the Canadian status of Entertainment One Canada Ltd., we could lose licenses, incentives and tax credits.Through our acquisition of eOne, we indirectly acquired the economic interests in Entertainment One Canada Ltd., a Canadian corporation (“EOCL”). EOCL is able to benefit from a number of licenses, incentive programs and Canadian government tax credits as a result of it being “Canadian controlled” as defined in the Investment Canada Act. We have taken measures to ensure that EOCL’s Canadian status is maintained. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to continue to maintain EOCL's Canadian status. The loss of EOCL’s Canadian status could harm our business, including the possible loss of future incentive programs and clawback of funding previously provided to EOCL.Governmental and Legal Risks Relating to our BusinessWe are subject to various government regulations, violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business. In addition, we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls, which could harm our business.We are subject to significant government regulations, including, in the U.S., under The Consumer Products Safety Act, The Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and The Flammable Fabrics Act, as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets. In addition, certain of our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration or similar international authorities. Advertising to children is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and a host of other agencies globally, and the collection of information from children under the age of 13 is subject to the provisions of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and other privacy laws around the world. The collection of personally identifiable information from anyone, including adults, is under increasing regulation in many markets, such as the General Data Protection Regulation adopted by the European Union, and data protection laws in the United States and in a number of other counties. While we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts and regulations, we cannot assure you that we will be in compliance and, if we fail to comply with these requirements or other regulations enacted in the future, we could be subject to fines, liabilities or sanctions which could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall. While costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business, the costs associated with future product recalls 40Table of Contentsindividually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant. In addition, any product recall, regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm the reputation of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations.As a large multinational corporation, we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world, including antitrust, employment, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, environmental regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition.Our entertainment business involves risks of liability claims for media content, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.As a distributor and producer of media content, we may face potential liability for defamation, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials distributed. These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against producers and distributors of media content. Any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.Failure to achieve our sustainability goals could result in reputational damage. We view sustainability challenges as opportunities to innovate and continuously improve our product design and operational efficiencies. We have set key goals and objectives in this area as described in our business section of this Form 10-K. Our reputation could be damaged if we fail to achieve our sustainability goals, or if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to the production and packaging of our products.We are involved in litigation, arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense.As a large multinational corporation, we are subject to regulatory investigations, litigation and arbitration disputes, including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of products that have been or may be developed by us, claims by third parties that our products infringe upon or misuse such third parties’ property or rights, or claims by former employees for employment related matters. Because the outcome of litigation, arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant cost for us and harm our business. The fact that we operate in a significant number of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements. Any successful claim against us could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations"
4,HAS,HASBRO INC,2022-02-23,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
.In evaluating our business, the material risks described below, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission should be considered carefully. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business. The occurrence of any of these events or circumstances could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flow or results of operations. This report contains forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary statements made under the heading ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" for more information on the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements.Strategic Risks Related to Our Business Our business will suffer if we are not successful in developing and expanding our owned and partner brands across our brand blueprint.Our strategy is to focus on fewer, larger global brands with an emphasis on developing and expanding those of our owned and key partner brands, which we view as having the largest global potential, across our brand blueprint. As we concentrate our efforts on a more select group of brands, we believe we can gain additional leverage and enhance the consumer experience. This focus means that our success depends disproportionately on our and our partners’ ability to successfully develop this select group of brands across our brand blueprint and to maintain and extend the reach and relevance of these brands to global consumers in a wide array of markets. This strategy has required us to acquire, build, invest in and develop our competencies in storytelling, digital gaming, consumer products and entertainment. Acquiring, developing, investing in and growing these competencies has required significant effort, time and money, with no assurance of success. The success of our brand blueprint strategy also requires significant alignment and integration among our business segments. If we are unable to successfully develop, maintain and expand our owned and key partner brands across our brand blueprint, our business performance will suffer. If we or our partners fail to successfully develop and deliver engaging storytelling through entertainment media our ability to build our brands and sell products will suffer.Engaging storytelling offered through entertainment media, such as television, films, digital content and other media, is an important way for consumers to experience our and our partners’ brands. The success, or lack of success, of such entertainment media efforts can significantly impact the demand for our products and our financial performance. We spend considerable resources in designing and developing products in conjunction with our and our partners’ planned media releases. We also rely heavily on the efforts of third parties, such as licensors, film studios, content producers and distribution channels with whom we work, with respect to the development of content and timing of media development, release dates and the ultimate consumer interest in and success of these media efforts. In some cases, we do not fully control when or if any particular project will be greenlit, developed or released. Our licensors, media partners or other third parties may change their plans with respect to projects and release dates or may decide to cancel development. Lack of control can make it difficult for us to get entertainment projects developed, plan future entertainment slates and to successfully develop and market products in conjunction with such entertainment projects, given the lengthy lead times involved in product development and successful marketing efforts. Any delay or cancellation of planned product development work, releases, or media support may decrease the number of products we sell, which may harm our business. In 2020 and continuing into parts of 2021, productions and entertainment releases were delayed due to the shutdown of productions and theaters during the COVID-19 pandemic. Delays and shutdowns such as those we have experienced, can have and had an adverse effect on our results. If films, television shows, or any other key entertainment content for which we develop and market products are not as successful as we and our partners anticipate, our revenues and earnings will decline. 28Table of ContentsConsumer interests change rapidly and acceptance of products and entertainment offerings are influenced by outside factors, making it difficult to create storytelling experiences and to design and develop products, play patterns and entertainment offerings which are and will continue to be popular with children, families and audiences.The interests of children, families, fans and audiences evolve extremely quickly and can change dramatically from year to year and by geography. To be successful, we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment, products and play patterns which will capture consumers’ interests and imagination, and quickly develop and introduce innovative products and engaging entertainment which can compete successfully for consumers’ limited time, attention and spending. This challenge is more difficult with the ever-increasing utilization of technology, social media and digital media in entertainment offerings, and the increasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers. Evolving consumer tastes and shifting interests, coupled with an ever-changing and expanding pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for consumer interest and acceptance, create an environment in which some products and entertainment offerings can fail to achieve consumer acceptance, and other products and entertainment offerings can be popular during a certain period of time but then be rapidly replaced. As a result, our products and entertainment offerings can have short consumer life cycles.Consumer acceptance of our or our partners’ entertainment offerings is also affected by outside factors, such as critical reviews, promotions, the quality and acceptance of films and television programs and content released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions and public tastes generally, all of which could change rapidly and most of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that television programs and films we produce or distribute will obtain favorable reviews or ratings, that films we produce or distribute will be popular with consumers and perform well at the box office or in other distribution channels, or that broadcasters will license the rights to broadcast any of our television programs in development or renew licenses to broadcast programs in our library.If we devote time and resources to developing and marketing products or entertainment that consumers do not accept or do not find interesting enough to buy in sufficient quantities to be profitable to us, our revenues and profits may decline and our business performance may be harmed. Similarly, if our product offerings and entertainment fail to correctly anticipate consumer interests, our revenues and earnings will be reduced.The challenge of continuously developing and offering products and storytelling experiences that are sought after by children is compounded by the sophistication of today’s children and the increasing array of technology and entertainment offerings available to them.Children are increasingly utilizing electronic devices, such as computers, tablets and mobile phones, and they are expanding their interests to a wider array of innovative, technology-driven entertainment products and digital and social media offerings at younger and younger ages. Our products and digital games business compete with the offerings of consumer electronics companies, gaming, digital media and social media companies. To meet this challenge we, and our competitors, are investing in, designing and marketing products and digital games which incorporate more technology, seek to integrate digital and analog play, and aim to capitalize on new play patterns and increased consumption of digital and social media. There can be no assurance our brands, products and digital games will successfully compete with other offerings or will achieve or sustain popularity.Our business will suffer if we are unable to grow our Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming business.A key component to the success of our brand blueprint strategy is to continue to invest in digital gaming and technology, particularly through our Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming business. We have invested substantially in this business segment and as a result it has seen significant growth over the past several years, and while primarily through growth in tabletop play, continued digital game development is a key growth factor for the future. If we are unable to continue to grow this business and ensure its integration with our other business segments, our business may be harmed. The digital gaming industry is highly competitive and costs associated with designing, developing and producing digital games and technologically advanced or sophisticated toy products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products, such as board and trading card games and action figures, with no assurance of success. The ability to sell enough of these advanced products, at prices high enough to recoup our costs and make a profit, is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment offerings and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions. As a result, we face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs and we may lose money on the development and sale of these products. Additionally, designing, developing and producing digital and technologically advanced or sophisticated products often relies on third parties and requires different competencies and follows different timelines than traditional toys and games. Delays in the design, development or production of these digital gaming products could have a significant impact on our ability to successfully offer such products. In addition, the pace of 29Table of Contentschange in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than for our other products. If a digital game fails to gain consumer acceptance early in its life cycle, there are limited opportunities to gain such acceptance through secondary launches or distribution through alternative platforms. This pace of change or lack of consumer acceptance means that the window in which a digital gaming product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games.If we fail to respond to or capitalize on the rapid technological development in the entertainment industry, including changes in entertainment delivery formats, our business could be harmed. The entertainment industry continues to experience frequent change driven by technological development, including developments with respect to the formats through which films, television programming, and other episodic content are delivered to consumers. With rapid technological changes and dramatically expanded digital content offerings, the scale and scope of these changes have accelerated in recent years. For example, consumers are increasingly accessing television, film and other episodic content on streaming and digital content networks, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Disney+ and Apple TV+ to name a few. Similarly, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, some entertainment offerings have gone direct to streaming channels as opposed to theaters or at the same time as theaters or have gone to streaming channels after only a short period of time in the theaters. Direct release to streaming channels is likely to continue. Technological as well as other changes caused by the pandemic have caused significant disruption to the retail distribution of entertainment offerings, and have caused and could in the future cause a negative impact on sales of our products and other forms of monetization of content, especially those which are reliant on box office success. We may lose opportunities to capitalize on changing market dynamics, technological innovations or consumer tastes if we do not adapt our content offerings or distribution capabilities in a timely manner. The overall effect that technological development and new digital distribution platforms have on the revenue and profits we derive from our entertainment content, including from merchandise sales derived from such content, and the additional costs associated with changing markets, media platforms and technologies, is unpredictable. If we fail to accurately assess and effectively respond to changes in technology and consumer behavior in the entertainment industry, our business may be harmed.We may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties.The success of entertainment properties for which we have a license, such as licenses we have with The Walt Disney Company, and the ability of us to successfully market and sell related products, can significantly affect our revenues and profitability. If we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series, the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering. In addition, competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure, maintain, and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms, if at all, and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design, develop and market successful products based on these properties.The license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial, and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales, which could result in write-offs of significant amounts which, in turn, would harm our results of operations. Acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable, which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal, or not pursuing certain new licenses. Additionally, as a licensee of entertainment-based properties, we cannot guarantee that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy, game or other family entertainment products, and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us.The play and entertainment industry is highly competitive and the barriers to entry are low. If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our revenues, market share and profitability could decline.The play and entertainment industry is highly competitive. We compete in the U.S. and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers, marketers, and sellers of analog toys and games, products which combine analog and digital play, digital gaming products, and other entertainment and consumer products, as well as with retailers who offer such products under their own private labels often at lower prices. In addition, we compete with companies who are focused on building their brands across multiple product and consumer categories, including through entertainment offerings. Across our business, we face competitors who are constantly monitoring and 30Table of Contentsattempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends, seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers, and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase. In addition to existing competitors, the barriers to entry for new participants in the play and entertainment industry are low, and the increasing importance of digital media and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest, has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets, and has broadened the array of companies we compete with. New participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time. These existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences. Our competitors’ products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products, lower our revenues and lower our profitability.Our entertainment business faces competition from major film studios and television production companies as well as other independent distributors and independent content producers.The success of our brand blueprint strategy is dependent in part on our ability to produce and distribute entertainment offerings that consumers want to experience and that create further awareness of our brands and products. Our global independent studios, operated by eOne, compete with major U.S. and international studios, that typically release a large number of films annually and command a significant share of box office revenues, streaming revenues, and television airtime, as well as other independent film and television production or distribution companies.Many of the major U.S. studios are part of large, diversified corporate groups with a variety of other operations, including television networks, cable channels and streaming services that can provide both in‑house distribution capability and varied sources of earnings that may allow them to better offset fluctuations in the financial performance of their film and television operations. Some of these competitors have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we do and may be able to compete aggressively on pricing in order to increase box office or streaming revenues, obtain distribution rights and obtain television airtime. In addition, the resources of the major studios may give them an advantage in acquiring other businesses or assets, including content libraries, that we might also be interested in acquiring. The competition we face may cause us to lose market share, achieve lower prices for our productions or pay more for third‑party content, any of which could harm our business.We may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures, or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization.Acquisitions and investments have been a component of our growth and the development of our business, such as our acquisition of our global independent studio, eOne. Acquisitions can broaden and diversify our brand holdings and product offerings, and allow us to build additional capabilities and competencies around our brand blueprint, such as entertainment and digital gaming offerings. We cannot be certain that the products and offerings of companies we may acquire, or acquire an interest in, will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products, develop our competencies or grow our business. In some cases, we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production, marketing and other operating, revenue or cost synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and, where applicable, cost savings, operating efficiencies and other advantages. However, we cannot be certain that these synergies, efficiencies and cost savings will be realized. Even if achieved, these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization. In other cases, we may acquire or invest in companies that we believe have strong and creative management, in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations. We cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products, entertainment or services in the future. We cannot guarantee that any acquisition or investment we may make will be successful or beneficial, and acquisitions can consume significant amounts of management attention and other resources, which may negatively impact other aspects of our business. 31Table of ContentsOperational Risks Related to our BusinessAn inability to develop, introduce and ship planned products, product lines and new brands in a timely and cost-effective manner may damage our business.In developing products, product lines and new brands we have anticipated dates for the associated product and brand introductions. When we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a particular product, product line or brand at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development, implementation, and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to manufacture, source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a cost-effective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands. This risk is heightened by our customers’ compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business. The risk is also exacerbated by the increasing sophistication of many of the products we are designing, and brands we are developing in terms of combining digital and analog technologies, and providing greater innovation and product differentiation. Unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process, significant increases in the planned cost of development, or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated, may reduce or eliminate the profitability of such products or, in some situations, may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued. If we are unable to navigate through global supply chain challenges, our business may be harmed.In 2021 and continuing into 2022, we have faced global supply chain challenges with the production and delivery of some products being delayed due to logistics, including labor, trucking and container shortages, port congestion and other shipping disruptions. We have experienced increases in material costs and shortages for some of our products, due in part to higher wages being paid due to labor shortages in China and Vietnam, as well as periodic and unpredictable manufacturing shut-downs due to COVID-19. While we have taken actions to lessen the impact of these supply chain challenges, such as through the use of alternative ports and air freight, such actions have resulted in higher costs and there can be no assurance that the actions taken will continue to be effective. We have also increased prices in some cases to help offset increased costs. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to increase prices in the future and we cannot assure that price increases we have already taken will offset the entirety of additional costs we have incurred and may incur in the future to mitigate the supply chain disruption. Further, if we are unable to negotiate favorable carrier agreements, deliver products on time or otherwise satisfy demand for our products, our business may be harmed. If we are unable to adapt our business to the continued shift to ecommerce, our business may be harmed. Our ecommerce business is accounting for a higher portion of the ultimate sales of our products to consumers than it has historically. In 2021, ecommerce sales represented a significant portion of overall sales to our key customers as consumers increasingly purchased our products online as compared to through in-store shopping due to the continued transition to ecommerce accelerated by the shutdown and limited access to retail stores during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ecommerce sales have resulted in retailers holding less inventory, which has caused us to adjust our supply chain. Additionally, if our technology and systems used to support ecommerce order processing are not effective, our ability to deliver products on time on a cost-effective basis may be adversely affected. Failure to continue to adapt our systems and supply chain and successfully fulfill ecommerce sales could harm our business. The concentration of our retail customer base and continued shift to ecommerce sales means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us.We depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products. For the fiscal year ended December 26, 2021, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Amazon.com and Target Corporation accounted for approximately 13%, 11% and 8%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenues. Due to our customer concentration, if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing business with us, significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us, favor competitors or new entrants, increase their direct competition with us by expanding their private-label business, change their purchasing patterns, impose unexpected fees on us, alter the manner in which they promote our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products, or return substantial amounts of our products, our business may be harmed. Our customers do not make binding long-term commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders. Any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products and 32Table of Contentsreduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products. In addition, increased concentration among our customers could negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers. Furthermore, as we experienced with the bankruptcy of Toys“R”Us, the failure or lack of success of a significant retail customer could negatively impact our revenues and profitability.Our substantial business, sales and manufacturing operations outside the U.S. subject us to risks associated with international operations.We operate facilities and sell products and entertainment offerings in numerous countries outside the U.S. Over time, we expect our international sales and operations to continue to grow both in dollars and as a percentage of our overall business as a result of a key business strategy to expand our presence in emerging and underserved international markets, such as Eastern Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia. Additionally, we utilize third-party manufacturers primarily located in the Far East, including China, Vietnam and India, to produce most of our products. These international operations, including operations in emerging markets, have unique consumer preferences and business climates, present additional challenges and are subject to risks that may significantly harm our sales, increase our costs or otherwise damage our business, including:•Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;•The imposition of tariffs, quotas, border adjustment taxes or other protectionist measures;•Potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross border transactions, which can materially increase our taxes and other costs of doing business; •Political instability, civil unrest and economic instability;•Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights; •Implications or difficulties arising out of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union;•Complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies and the evolution of laws and regulations and related enforcement, as such laws and policies relate to our products and approval of entertainment;•Difficulties understanding the retail climate, consumer trends, local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be quite different from the U.S.;•Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and cost in recovering therefrom; •Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another, including port congestion, strikes, labor shortages and other events causing transportation delays and interruptions;•Increased investment and operational complexity to make our products compatible with systems in various countries and compliant with local laws; and•Changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing business internationally.Because of the importance of international sales, sourcing and manufacturing to our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business and operating in an environment with these risks.Our reliance on third-party manufacturers to produce our products, particularly in China, Vietnam and India, presents risks to our business.All our products are manufactured by third-party manufacturers, the majority of which are in China, with a significant amount of our product sourcing also coming from manufacturers in Vietnam and a lesser amount from India. Should changes be necessary, our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted, over a significant period of time, to alternative sources of supply. If we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product lines due to economic, political, civil, labor or other factors beyond our control, including work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, natural disasters, adverse health conditions or pandemics, our ability to manufacture would be adversely affected and our operations may be substantially disrupted, potentially for a 33Table of Contentssignificant period of time. This delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business while alternative sources of supply are secured.Given that our toy and game manufacturing is conducted by third-party manufacturers, health conditions, such as the coronavirus, and other factors affecting social and economic activity where our manufacturers are located may affect the movement of people and products into and from those locations to our major markets, including North America and Europe. Further, increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in markets where we manufacture, could also have a significant negative impact on our operations, revenues and earnings. Prolonged disputes or slowdowns at west coast or other ports can negatively impact both the time and cost of transporting goods into the U.S. Natural disasters or health pandemics, such as COVID-19, impacting our manufacturers had and can have a significant negative impact on our business.Further, the imposition of tariffs, border adjustment taxes, trade sanctions or other regulations or economic penalties by the U.S. or the European Union against products imported by us from China or other foreign countries, or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with China or other foreign countries in which we operate, could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the U.S. or Europe, shift more orders from direct import to domestic sales, put additional shipping and warehousing burdens on us, delay the time of our sales to retailers, result in lost sales, and otherwise harm our business. Additionally, the suspension of the operations of a third-party manufacturer by government inspectors in China or another market in which we source products could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales.We have been working over the last several years to reduce our reliance on manufacturing in China, such as by moving production of certain products to facilities in other countries like Vietnam, India and Mexico, as well as by increasing production of our products in other markets, including in the U.S. We plan to continue those efforts in future years, but cannot guarantee we will be as successful in these efforts as we plan. Furthermore, many of these newer production facilities, such as in Vietnam and India, raise other risks in that we are working with vendors who have not been manufacturing products like ours for as long as historical vendors in China. That means these new vendors must successfully develop the capability to manufacture our products to the quality and safety standards we require and within the tight timeframe required by our customers. Newer and less experienced vendors are more susceptible to product quality, logistics and other issues, due in part to their less mature infrastructure or unfamiliarity with our product standards. We require our third-party manufacturers to comply with our Global Business Ethics Principles, which are designed to prevent products manufactured for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions. Notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them, there is always a risk that one or more of our third-party manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such non-compliance. Any failure of our third-party manufacturers to comply with labor, consumer, product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation, harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us.Our dependence on third-party relationships with studios, content producers and distribution channels to develop and distribute entertainment content is critical to our entertainment operations.We rely on third party relationships with studios, content producers and distribution channels to develop and distribute entertainment content. For example, eOne relies on third‑party content producers and distribution channels to sell and distribute films and television programs. Our financial performance may be adversely affected by our relationships with these studios, content producers and distribution channels. Some of our content producers are affiliates of major studios that have their own distribution capability in the markets in which we operate, and some of our distribution channels produce their own content or are affiliated with other content producers. These third-party content producers and distribution channels may decide, or be required by their respective parent companies, to use their intra‑company distribution or content production capabilities rather than contracting with us. Our business may be harmed if the studios, content producers and distribution channels with which we work stop or reduce the amount of work they do with us or otherwise demand less favorable terms to us.We have entered into long-term output licensing agreements for the acquisition of content and these agreements may not be renewed on favorable terms or at all.In some cases, we have entered into long-term agreements to acquire films with producers. These agreements require us to pay for films released by the relevant studio at rates typically calculated by reference to the film’s budget. In addition, we have entered into long term contracts for the acquisition of certain of our television programs. As these contracts expire, we may choose to renew, renegotiate or terminate them. These arrangements are also terminable by the counterparty under certain circumstances. If we are unable to renew or replace them on 34Table of Contentsacceptable terms, we may not be able to replace this content with other film acquisitions. Even if these contracts are renewed or replaced, the terms on which we acquire content may be less favorable than the terms of our current agreements and the financial success or quantity of films and television programs we acquire through these long-term contracts may decrease. There can also be no assurance that revenues based on these long-term contracts will exceed the costs of acquiring the films or television programs. Our success is dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees.Our officers and employees are at the heart of all our efforts. It is their skill, innovation and hard work that drive our success. We compete with many other potential employers in recruiting, hiring and retaining our management team and our many other skilled officers and employees around the world. In the entertainment and digital gaming industries, experienced personnel and top creative talent are in high demand and competition for their talent is intense. The increasing prevalence of remote work creates further challenges in retaining employees as some employees desire more flexibility in their employment and the ability to work remotely opens up more employment opportunities. The impact of failing to retain key employees can be high due to loss of key knowledge and relationships, loss of creative talent, lost productivity, hiring and training costs, all of which could result in lower profitability. We cannot guarantee that we will recruit, hire or retain the key personnel we need to succeed.We have experienced significant changes in our leadership due in part to the untimely passing of our former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Brian Goldner in October of 2021, resulting in the recent appointment of Chris Cocks as our new Chief Executive Officer and, Eric Nyman as our new President and Chief Operating Officer, both becoming effective February 25, 2022. Our future success will depend on the leadership of our key executives such as Mr. Cocks and Mr. Nyman. In addition, we have experienced the retirement and transition of certain other executives, and changes in our employee composition, both in terms of global distribution and in skill sets. Our loss of key management or other employees, inability to drive success through our new leaders, or our inability to retain or hire talented people with the skill sets we need for our diverse and changing business, could significantly harm our business.If we fail to develop diverse top talent, we may be unable to compete and our business may be harmed. To compete successfully, we must continuously develop a diverse group of talented people. We promote a diverse and inclusive work environment. To that end, we have set goals and objectives with respect to hiring and retention of talented, diverse employees, which we believe will foster new ideas and perspectives that will benefit our business. Competition for diverse talent is intense. We cannot guarantee we will achieve our goals or that our actions will result in expected benefits to our business. Our entertainment business could be adversely affected by strikes or other union job actions.Our entertainment business is dependent in part upon highly specialized union members who are essential to the production of films and television programs. A strike by, or a lockout of, one or more of the unions that provide personnel essential to the production of films or television programs could delay or halt our ongoing production activities. Such a halt or delay, depending on the length of time, could cause a delay or interruption in our release of new films and television programs, which could harm our entertainment business.Our business may be harmed if we are unable to protect our critical intellectual property rights.Our intellectual property, including our trademarks and tradenames, copyrights, patents, and rights under our license agreements and other agreements that establish our intellectual property rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, is of critical value. We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property in the U.S. and around the world. From time to time, third parties have challenged, and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our intellectual property in the U.S. and around the world. In addition, our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights, as well as the risk of unauthorized third parties copying and distributing our entertainment content or leaking portions of planned entertainment content. We may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. Similarly, third parties may claim ownership over certain aspects of our products, productions or other intellectual property. Our failure to successfully protect our intellectual property rights could significantly harm our business and competitive position.35Table of ContentsFailure to successfully operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability.We rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications to manage many aspects of our business, including product development, management of our supply chain, sale and delivery of our products, royalty and financial reporting and various other processes and transactions. We are critically dependent on the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems and related back-up systems. These systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, malware and other cybersecurity breaches, catastrophic events such as hurricanes, fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees or partners. The efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems, including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully. The failure of our information systems or third-party hosted technology to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business, require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability.If our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed.We and our business partners maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world and in the cloud. This data relates to all aspects of our business, including current and future products and entertainment under development, and also contains certain customer, consumer, supplier, partner and employee data. We maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data, but notwithstanding such protective measures, there is a risk of intrusion, cyber-attacks or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. They are often carried out by motivated, well-resourced, skilled and persistent actors, including nation states, organized crime groups, “hacktivists” and employees or contractors acting with malicious intent. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware and key loggers, ransomware, a denial-of-service attack, a malicious website, the use of social engineering and other means to affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our technology systems and data. Cyber-attacks could also include supply chain attacks, which could cause a delay in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we provide confidential and proprietary information to our third-party business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business. While we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data, and where applicable, that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties, those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of such data. Any compromise of the confidential data of our customers, consumers, suppliers, partners, employees or ourselves, or failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of or damage to this data through breach of our information technology systems or other means could substantially disrupt our operations, harm our customers, consumers, employees and other business partners, damage our reputation, violate applicable laws and regulations, subject us to potentially significant costs and liabilities and result in a loss of business that could be material. Global and Economic Risks Relating to our BusinessThe global coronavirus outbreak or other similar outbreaks of communicable infections, diseases, or public health pandemics in the markets in which we and our employees, consumers, customers, partners, licensees, suppliers and manufacturers operate, could substantially harm our business.The global outbreak of the coronavirus which continues to adversely impact global populations, and any other variants or outbreaks of communicable infections, diseases or other adverse public health conditions in markets in which we, our employees, consumers, customers, partners, licensees, licensors, suppliers and manufacturers operate, could have a significant negative impact on our business, revenues and profitability. The occurrence of these types of events can result, and in the case of the coronavirus has resulted in, disruptions and damage to our business, caused by a number of factors:•difficulties in shipping and distributing products due to ongoing port capacity, and labor, shipping container and truck transportation shortages, resulting in higher costs for both ocean and air freight and delays in the availability of products, which can result in delayed sales and in some cases result in lost sales. These and other disruptions are expected to continue in 2022;•disruptions in supply of products, due to closures or reductions in operations at third-party manufacturing facilities across several geographies including, but not limited to, China, Vietnam, India, the United States and Ireland;36Table of Contents•adverse sales impact due to changes in consumer purchasing behavior and availability of products to consumers, resulting from retail store closures, limited reopening of retail stores and limitations on the capacity of ecommerce channels to supply additional products;•fluctuations in our performance based on the progress of different countries in controlling the coronavirus and the maturity of e-commerce platforms in those markets;•limited production of live-action scripted and unscripted entertainment content due to the hard stop and soft reopening of production studios;•delays or postponements of entertainment productions and releases of entertainment content both internally and by our partners;•increases in entertainment production costs due to measures required to minimize COVID-19 risks; and•challenges of working remotely.In response to these challenges, we developed and continue to develop and execute plans to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 to the business. Our responses included:•utilizing our global supply chain and existing inventory to work to meet demand, while managing freight cost increases across all markets, as our manufacturing facilities returned to varying levels of operation;•mitigating risk in our global supply chain by expanding shipping capacity, activating alternate ports in China and the U.S. and prioritizing supply based on inventory and customer needs, including utilizing air freight if necessary;•accelerating our business online and expanding omni-channel to get products to customers and consumers;•developing innovative ways to enable players to continue to play games remotely;•continuing to create new entertainment, including post-production work and the development of animation productions remotely; and•implementing preventative measures and health and safety protocols.We have reopened our offices, providing employees flexibility in their return to the office by working partially in the office and partially remote. We have taken measures to safely bring additional workers back to the office, including a return to fully remote work when variants emerge which increase infection rates significantly in areas where we do business. The transition back from fully remote work to partial remote and partial in person may be difficult for some employees. We are actively soliciting feedback and making modifications to provide our employees with a productive and safe environment, and plan to continue to monitor employee efficiency, satisfaction, and morale as we continue to transition. There can be no assurance that employees will not have some disruption in their work due to the transition. Changes in flexible working arrangements could impact employee retention, employees’ productivity and morale, strain our technology resources and introduce operational risks. Additionally, the risk of cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents may be heightened as a result of our moving increasingly towards a remote working environment, which may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks.   The impact of coronavirus outbreak continues to be fluid and uncertain, and while vaccines are being rolled out, it is still difficult to forecast the final impact it could have on our future operations. If our business experiences prolonged occurrence of adverse public health conditions due to the coronavirus or other similar outbreaks, we believe our business could be substantially harmed.Adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we and our employees, consumers, customers, suppliers and manufacturers operate could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products, and lower our revenues, margins and profitability.Various economic conditions in the markets we, our employees, consumers, customers, suppliers and manufacturers operate, could have a significant negative impact on our revenues, profitability and business. The occurrence of adverse economic conditions can result in manufacturing and other work stoppages, slowdowns and delays; shortages or delays in production or shipment of products or raw materials; delays or reduced purchases from customers and consumers; and other factors that cause increases in costs or delay in revenues. Inflation, such as what consumers in the U.S. and other economies are experiencing, can cause significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers, such as gasoline, home heating fuels, or groceries, may reduce household spending on the discretionary products and entertainment we offer. Weakened economic conditions, lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may also significantly 37Table of Contentsreduce consumer purchases of our products and spending on entertainment. Economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks, wars and other conflicts, natural disasters, increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs, or the prospect of such events. Such a weakened economic and business climate, as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate, could harm our revenues and profitability.Our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products, but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit. Rising fuel and raw material prices, due to inflation or otherwise, for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components, increased transportation and shipping costs, and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products, which in turn may reduce our margins, reduce our profitability and harm our business.Changes in U.S., global or regional economic conditions could harm our business and financial performance.Our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending in the markets in which we operate. Reductions in stimulus payments provided to consumers could impact discretionary spending. Recessions, credit crises and other economic downturns, or disruptions in credit markets, in the U.S. and in other markets in which we operate can result in lower levels of economic activity, lower employment levels, less consumer disposable income, and lower consumer confidence. Similarly, reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers, such as their homes or stock market investments, can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power. Any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products and entertainment. This in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability.Financial Risks Relating to our BusinessOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate due to seasonality in our business. Sales of our toys, games and other entertainment products are extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from September through December in anticipation of the holiday season. This seasonality for our consumer products business has increased over time, as retailers become more and more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response or just in time inventory management techniques, including the use of automated inventory replenishment programs. Further, ecommerce continues to grow significantly and accounts for a higher portion of the ultimate sales of our products to consumers. Ecommerce retailers tend to hold less inventory and take inventory closer to the time of sale to consumers than traditional retailers. As a result, customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers, such as us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. While these techniques reduce a retailer’s investment in inventory, they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier. This can also result in our losing significant revenues and earnings if our supply chain is unable to supply product to our customers when they want it. Tariffs can exacerbate this negative impact by causing retailers to shift from direct import to domestic orders, further pressuring our supply chain.The level of inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us. If we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional products to fully meet consumer demand. Additionally, the logistics of supplying more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance. These risks have been exacerbated in 2021 and continuing into 2022 due to the global supply chain challenges we have faced due to logistics, including labor, trucking and container shortages, port congestion and other shipping disruptions. Our entertainment business is also subject to seasonal variations based on the timing of television, film, streaming and digital content releases. Release dates are determined by several factors, including the timing of holiday periods, geographical release dates and competition in the market, and more recently, the timing of release dates has been affected by the pandemic.This seasonal patterns of our business requires significant use of working capital, mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers. Our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand, resulting in under producing popular items and/or overproducing less popular items, would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations.38Table of ContentsAs a result of the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year, by unforeseen events such as a natural disaster, a terrorist attack, economic shock or pandemic that harms the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events such as strikes or port delays or other supply chain challenges that interfere with the shipment of goods, particularly from the Far East, during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season.If we incurred any significant impairment charges, our net earnings would be reduced. Declines in the profitability of acquired brands or our decision to reduce our focus or exit these brands may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge. Similarly, declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in a write-down of our goodwill and consequently harm our net earnings. We may incur impairments if the films and television programs we acquire and produce do not perform well enough to recoup our acquisition, production, marketing and distribution costs.We incur significant costs to acquire, produce and distribute entertainment content. Most agreements to acquire content for distribution require minimum guarantees against royalties. The minimum guarantees are derived from our estimate of net revenues that will be realized from our distribution of the title in the relevant markets, and actual results may differ from those estimates. If sales do not meet our original estimates, we may: •not recognize the expected gross margin or net profit; •not recoup our minimum guarantees or distribution expenses; •record accelerated amortization and/or fair value write‑downs of minimum guarantees paid; or •not recoup the additional funds and expenses invested to market films that we have produced or acquired.With respect to content we produce, we are required to amortize capitalized production costs based on estimated ultimate revenue as we recognize revenues from the associated films or television productions. Unamortized production costs are evaluated for impairment each reporting period on a project‑by‑project basis. If estimated remaining revenue is not sufficient to recover the unamortized production costs, the unamortized production costs will be written down to fair value. In any given quarter, if we lower our previous forecast with respect to total anticipated revenue from any individual film or other project, we may be required to accelerate amortization or record impairment charges with respect to the unamortized costs, even if we have previously recorded impairment charges for such film or other project. Such impairment and accelerated amortization charges and write‑offs could harm our financial results.Similarly, our business could be harmed by greater-than-expected costs, or unexpected delays or difficulties, associated with our investment in Discovery Family Channel, such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or in building advertising revenues for Discovery Family Channel. During the fourth quarter of 2021 we recorded an impairment loss of $74.1 million associated with our investment in the Discovery Family Channel.Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance.Our global operations mean we transact business in many different jurisdictions with many different currencies. As a result, if the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes, our financial results as reported in U.S. dollars, may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected. Similarly, our expenses can be significantly impacted, in U.S. dollar terms, by exchange rates, meaning the profitability of our business in U.S. dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control. Depreciation in key currencies may have a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings as they are reported in U.S. dollars.39Table of ContentsOur indebtedness may limit our availability of cash, cause us to divert cash to fund debt service payments or make it more difficult to take certain other actions.We incurred significant indebtedness to finance our acquisition of eOne. The increase in our debt service obligations resulting from additional indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In particular, our increased indebtedness could:•make it more difficult and/or costly for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due, particularly during adverse economic and industry conditions, because a decrease in revenues or increase in costs could cause cash flow from operations to be insufficient to make scheduled debt service payments;•require a substantial portion of our available cash to be used for debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of our cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, acquisitions or other strategic opportunities, dividend payments, share repurchases and other general corporate purposes;•result in downgrades in the credit ratings on our indebtedness, which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms or at all (including in order to refinance our other debt), increase the interest rates under our credit facilities and under any new indebtedness we may incur;•make it more difficult for us to raise capital to fund working capital, make capital expenditures, pay dividends, pursue strategic initiatives or for other purposes;•result in higher interest expense, which could be further increased in case of current or future borrowings subject to variable rates of interest;•require that materially adverse terms, conditions or covenants be placed on us under our debt instruments, which could include, for example, limitations on additional borrowings or limitations on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock or make investments, any of which could hinder our access to capital markets or our flexibility in the conduct of our business and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse competitive industry conditions; and•jeopardize our ability to pay our indebtedness if our business experienced a severe downturn.If we were unable to obtain or service our other external financings, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome, our business would be harmed.Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our working capital needs, particularly those in the third and fourth quarters, we may rely on our commercial paper program, revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital. We currently have a commercial paper program which, subject to market conditions, and availability under our committed revolving credit facility, allows us to issue up to $1,000.0 million in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a source of working capital funding and liquidity. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms, or at all, at any given point in time.We also have a revolving credit agreement which provides for a $1,500.0 million committed revolving credit facility. The credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility. These restrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial, operating and strategic flexibility. Non-compliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines, a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations.Not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing, but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing. In times of severe economic downturn and/or distress in the credit markets, it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us. In such a situation, it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities, and it might not be possible to find alternative sources of funding.40Table of ContentsWe also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to time, through the issuance of debt securities. Our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interest rates, and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities. The failure to receive financing on desirable terms, or at all, could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities.If we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance our outstanding debt or face default. We cannot guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms, or at all.If we are unable to obtain production financing, on favorable terms or at all, we may be unable to produce certain films and television programs or if we do so, would have to produce them at higher cost and greater risk to us.With the acquisition of eOne we expect to continue to use production financing to finance certain of our productions, which eOne has historically been able to obtain on commercially reasonable terms. The use of third party financing also reduces the risk to us and reduces the demand on our cash and liquidity. In the event that we are unable to provide eOne with appropriate financing or if third party production financing becomes unavailable on reasonable commercial terms or at all, we may not have sufficient alternative funding sources available to finance a particular production. In this case, we may not be able to produce the films and television programs we plan to do, which could harm our business.Changes in, or differing interpretations of, income tax laws and rules, and changes in our geographic operating results, may impact our effective tax rate.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in various international tax jurisdictions. We also conduct business activities between our operating units in various jurisdictions and we are subject to transfer pricing rules in the countries in which we operate. There is some degree of uncertainty and subjectivity in complying with transfer pricing rules. Our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in, or the interpretation of, tax laws, such as those being considered by the current U.S. administration and other jurisdictions in which we do business, or by changes in the amount of revenue and earnings we derive, or are determined to derive by tax authorities, from jurisdictions with differing tax rates.In addition, we may be subject to tax examinations by federal, state, and international jurisdictions, and these examinations can result in significant tax findings if the tax authorities interpret the application of laws and rules differently than we do or disagree with the intercompany rates we are applying. We assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from tax uncertainties. While we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome of these uncertain tax benefits, or results of possible current or future tax examinations, may differ from our estimates and may have a significant adverse impact on our business and operating results.If we lose the Canadian status of Entertainment One Canada Ltd., we could lose licenses, incentives and tax credits.Through our acquisition of eOne, we indirectly acquired the economic interests in Entertainment One Canada Ltd., a Canadian corporation (“EOCL”). EOCL is able to benefit from a number of licenses, incentive programs and Canadian government tax credits as a result of it being “Canadian controlled” as defined in the Investment Canada Act. We have taken measures to ensure that EOCL’s Canadian status is maintained. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to continue to maintain EOCL's Canadian status. The loss of EOCL’s Canadian status could harm our business, including the possible loss of future incentive programs and clawback of funding previously provided to EOCL.Governmental and Legal Risks Relating to our BusinessWe are subject to various government regulations, violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business. In addition, we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls, which could harm our business.We are subject to significant government regulations, including, in the U.S., under The Consumer Products Safety Act, The Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and The Flammable Fabrics Act, as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets. In addition, certain of our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration or similar international authorities. Advertising to children is subject 41Table of Contentsto regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and a host of other agencies globally, and the collection of information from children under the age of 13 is subject to the provisions of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and other privacy laws around the world. The collection of personally identifiable information from anyone, including adults, is under increasing regulation in many markets, such as the General Data Protection Regulation adopted by the European Union, and data protection laws in the United States and in a number of other counties. While we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts and regulations, we cannot assure you that we will be in compliance and, if we fail to comply with these requirements or other regulations enacted in the future, we could be subject to fines, liabilities or sanctions which could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall. While costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business, the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant. In addition, any product recall, regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm the reputation of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations.As a large multinational corporation, we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world, including antitrust, employment, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, environmental regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition.We may face increased costs in achieving our sustainability goals, and, any failure to achieve our goals could result in reputational damage. We view sustainability challenges as opportunities to innovate and continuously improve our product design and operational efficiencies. We also believe the long-term viability and health of our own operations and our supply chain, and the significant potential for environmental improvements, are critical to our business success. We have set key goals and objectives in this area as described in our business section of this Form 10-K.We devote significant resources and expenditures to help achieve these goals. It is possible that we will incur significant expense in trying to achieve these goals with no assurance that we will be successful.  Additionally, our reputation could be damaged if we fail to achieve our sustainability goals, or if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to the production and packaging of our products.Our entertainment business involves risks of liability claims for media content, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.As a distributor and producer of media content, we may face potential liability for defamation, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials distributed. These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against producers and distributors of media content. Any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.We are involved in litigation, arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense.As a large multinational corporation, we are subject to regulatory investigations, litigation and arbitration disputes, including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of products that have been or may be developed by us, claims by third parties that our products infringe upon or misuse such third parties’ property or rights, or claims by former employees for employment related matters. Because the outcome of litigation, arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant cost for us and harm our business. The fact that we operate in a significant number of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements. Any successful claim against us could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations"
17,HAS,HASBRO INC,2021-02-24,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
.In evaluating our business, the material risks described below, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission should be considered carefully. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business. The occurrence of any of these events or circumstances could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flow or results of operations. This report contains forward-looking statements; please refer to the cautionary statements made under the heading ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" for more information on the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements.Strategic Risks Related to Our Business If we are not successful in developing and expanding our owned and our partner brands across our brand blueprint our business will suffer.We have made a strategic decision to focus on fewer, larger global brands with an emphasis on developing and expanding those of our owned and key partner brands, which we view as having the largest global potential. As we concentrate our efforts on a more select group of brands, we believe we can gain additional leverage and enhance the consumer experience. This focus means that our success depends disproportionately on our and our partners’ ability to successfully develop this select group of brands across our brand blueprint and to maintain and extend the reach and relevance of these brands to global consumers in a wide array of markets. This strategy has required us to acquire, build and develop our competencies in storytelling, digital gaming, consumer products and entertainment. Acquiring, developing and growing these competencies has required significant effort, time and money, with no assurance of success. If we are unable to successfully develop, maintain and expand our owned and key partner brands, continue to drive their relevance to consumers and grow sales of products and storytelling experiences based on those brands, our business performance will suffer. If we or our partners fail to successfully develop and deliver engaging storytelling through entertainment media our ability to build our brands and sell products will suffer.Engaging storytelling offered through entertainment media, such as television, films, digital content and other media, has become increasingly important as a way for consumers to experience our and our partners’ brands. The success, or lack of success, of such entertainment media efforts can significantly impact the demand for our products and our financial performance. We spend considerable resources in designing and developing products in conjunction with our and our partners’ planned media releases. We also rely heavily on the efforts of third parties, such as licensors, film studios, content producers and distribution channels with whom we work, with respect to the development of content and timing of media development, release dates and the ultimate consumer interest in and success of these media efforts. We do not fully control when or if any particular project will be greenlit, developed or released, and our licensors, media partners or other third parties may change their plans with respect to projects and release dates or cancel development all together. Lack of control can make it difficult for us to get entertainment projects developed, plan future entertainment slates and to successfully develop and market products in conjunction with such entertainment projects, given the lengthy lead times involved in product development and successful marketing efforts. Any delay or cancellation of planned product development work, releases, or media support may decrease the number of products we sell, which may harm our business. In 2020, productions and entertainment releases were delayed due to the shutdown of productions and theaters during the Covid-19 pandemic. These delays and shutdowns had an adverse effect on our results during 2020. If films, television shows, or any other key entertainment content for which we develop and market products are not as successful as we and our partners anticipate, our revenues and earnings will decline. Consumer interests change rapidly and acceptance of products and entertainment offerings are influenced by outside factors, making it difficult to create storytelling experiences and to design and develop products and entertainment offerings which are and will continue to be popular with children, families and audiences.The interests of children, families and audiences evolve extremely quickly and can change dramatically from year to year and by geography. To be successful, we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment, products and play patterns which will capture consumers’ interests and imagination, and quickly develop and introduce innovative products and engaging entertainment which can compete successfully for consumers’ limited time, attention and spending. This challenge is more difficult with the ever-increasing utilization of technology and digital media in entertainment offerings, and the increasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers. Evolving consumer tastes and shifting interests, coupled with an ever-changing and expanding pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for consumer interest and acceptance, create an environment in which some products and entertainment offerings can fail to achieve consumer acceptance, and other products and 27Table of Contentsentertainment offerings can be popular during a certain period of time but then be rapidly replaced. As a result, our products and entertainment offerings often have short consumer life cycles.Consumer acceptance of our or our partners’ entertainment offerings is also affected by outside factors, such as critical reviews, promotions, the quality and acceptance of films and television programs and content released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions and public tastes generally, all of which could change rapidly and most of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that television programs and films we produce or distribute will obtain favorable reviews or ratings, that films we produce or distribute will be popular with consumers and perform well at the box office or in other distribution channels, or that broadcasters will license the rights to broadcast any of our television programs in development or renew licenses to broadcast programs in our library.If we devote time and resources to developing and marketing products or entertainment that consumers do not accept or do not find interesting enough to buy in sufficient quantities to be profitable to us, our revenues and profits may decline and our business performance may be harmed. Similarly, if our product offerings and entertainment fail to correctly anticipate consumer interests, our revenues and earnings will be reduced.The challenge of continuously developing and offering products and storytelling experiences that are sought after by children is compounded by the sophistication of today’s children and the increasing array of technology and entertainment offerings available to them.Children are increasingly utilizing electronic devices, such as computers, tablets and mobile phones, and they are expanding their interests to a wider array of innovative, technology-driven entertainment products and digital and social media offerings at younger and younger ages. Our products and digital games business compete with the offerings of consumer electronics companies, gaming, digital media and social media companies. To meet this challenge we, and our competitors, are investing in, designing and marketing products and digital games which incorporate more technology, seek to integrate digital and analog play, and aim to capitalize on new play patterns and increased consumption of digital and social media. There can be no assurance our brands, products and digital games will successfully compete with other offerings or will achieve or sustain popularity.We continue to invest in digital gaming and technology, particularly through our Wizards of the Coast business. Costs associated with designing, developing and producing digital games and technologically advanced or sophisticated toy products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products, such as board and trading card games and action figures. The ability to sell enough of these advanced products, at prices high enough to recoup our costs and make a profit, is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment offerings and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions. As a result, we face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs and we may lose money on the development and sale of these products. Additionally, designing, developing and producing digital and technologically advanced or sophisticated products requires different competencies and follows different timelines than traditional toys and games. Delays in the design, development or production of these products could have a significant impact on our ability to successfully offer such products. In addition, the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than for our other products. This pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games.If we fail to respond to or capitalize on the rapid technological development in the entertainment industry, including changes in entertainment delivery formats, our business could be harmed. The entertainment industry experiences frequent change driven by technological development, including developments with respect to the formats through which films, television programming, other episodic content and recorded music are delivered to consumers. With rapid technological changes and dramatically expanded digital content offerings, the scale and scope of these changes have accelerated in recent years. For example, consumers are increasingly accessing television, film and other episodic content on streaming and digital content networks, such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, Disney+ and Apple TV+. Similarly, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, entertainment offerings have gone direct to streaming channels as opposed to theaters or have gone to streaming channels after only a short period of time in the theaters. Technological as well as other changes caused by the pandemic have caused significant disruption to the retail distribution of entertainment offerings, and have caused and could in the future cause a negative impact on sales of our products and other forms of monetization of content, especially those which are reliant on box office success. We may lose opportunities to capitalize on changing market dynamics, technological innovations or consumer tastes if we do not adapt our content offerings or distribution capabilities in a timely manner. The overall effect that technological development and new digital distribution platforms have on the revenue and profits we derive from our entertainment content, including from 28Table of Contentsmerchandise sales derived from such content, and the additional costs associated with changing markets, media platforms and technologies, is unpredictable. If we fail to accurately assess and effectively respond to changes in technology and consumer behavior in the entertainment industry, our business may be harmed.We may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties.The success of entertainment properties for which we have a license, such as MARVEL, STAR WARS, DISNEY FROZEN, BEYBLADE, DISNEY PRINCESS and SESAME STREET, and the ability of us to successfully market and sell related products, can significantly affect our revenues and profitability. If we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series, the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering. In addition, competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure, maintain, and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms, if at all, and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design, develop and market successful products based on these properties.The license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial, and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales, which could result in write-offs of significant amounts which, in turn, would harm our results of operations. Acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable, which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal, or missing business opportunities for new licenses. Additionally, as a licensee of entertainment-based properties, we cannot guarantee that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy, game or other family entertainment products, and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us.The play and entertainment industry is highly competitive and the barriers to entry are low. If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our revenues, market share and profitability could decline.The play and entertainment industry is highly competitive. We compete in the U.S. and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers, marketers, and sellers of analog toys and games, products which combine analog and digital play, digital gaming products, and other entertainment and consumer products, as well as with retailers who offer such products under their own private labels often at lower prices. In addition, we compete with companies who are focused on building their brands across multiple product and consumer categories, including through entertainment offerings. Across our business, we face competitors who are constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends, seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers, and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase. In addition to existing competitors, the barriers to entry for new participants in the play and entertainment industry are low, and the increasing importance of digital media and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest, has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets, and has broadened the array of companies we compete with. New participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time. These existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences. Our competitors’ products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products, lower our revenues and lower our profitability.Our entertainment business faces competition from major film studios and television production companies as well as other independent distributors and independent content producers.The success of our brand blueprint strategy is dependent in part on our ability to produce and distribute entertainment offerings that consumers want to experience and that create further awareness of our brands and products. Our independent studios, now operated by eOne, compete with major U.S. and international studios, that typically release a large number of films annually and command a significant share of box office revenues, streaming revenues, and television airtime, as well as other independent film and television production or distribution companies.Many of the major U.S. studios are part of large, diversified corporate groups with a variety of other operations, including television networks and cable channels that can provide both in‑house distribution capability and varied sources of earnings that may allow them to better offset fluctuations in the financial performance of their film and television operations. Some of these competitors have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than 29Table of Contentswe do and may be able to compete aggressively on pricing in order to increase box office revenues, obtain distribution rights and obtain television airtime. In addition, the resources of the major studios may give them an advantage in acquiring other businesses or assets, including content libraries, that we might also be interested in acquiring. The competition we face may cause us to lose market share, achieve lower prices for our productions or pay more for third‑party content, any of which could harm our business.We may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures, or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization.Acquisitions and investments have been a component of our growth and the development of our business, such as our recent acquisition of eOne. Acquisitions can broaden and diversify our brand holdings and product offerings, and allow us to build additional capabilities and competencies around our brand blueprint, such as our acquisition of eOne which added proven television and film capabilities. We cannot be certain that the products and offerings of companies we may acquire, or acquire an interest in, will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products, develop our competencies or grow our business. In some cases, we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production, marketing and other operating, revenue or cost synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and, where applicable, cost savings, operating efficiencies and other advantages. However, we cannot be certain that these synergies, efficiencies and cost savings will be realized. Even if achieved, these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization. In other cases, we may acquire or invest in companies that we believe have strong and creative management, in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations. We cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products, entertainment or services in the future. We cannot guarantee that any acquisition or investment we may make will be successful or beneficial, and acquisitions can consume significant amounts of management attention and other resources, which may negatively impact other aspects of our business. Operational Risks Related to our BusinessAn inability to develop and introduce planned products, product lines and new brands in a timely and cost-effective manner or our inability to adapt to ecommerce may damage our business.In developing products, product lines and new brands we have anticipated dates for the associated product and brand introductions. When we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a particular product, product line or brand at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development, implementation, and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to manufacture, source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a cost-effective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands. This risk is heightened by our customers’ compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business. Further, ecommerce and omni-channel business is growing significantly and accounting for a higher portion of the ultimate sales of our products to consumers. Ecommerce retailers tend to hold less inventory and take inventory closer to the time of sale to consumers than traditional retailers. The risk is also exacerbated by the increasing sophistication of many of the products we are designing, and brands we are developing in terms of combining digital and analog technologies, and providing greater innovation and product differentiation. Unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process, significant increases in the planned cost of development, or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated, may reduce or eliminate the profitability of such products or, in some situations, may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued.The concentration of our retail customer base and continued shift to ecommerce sales means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us.We depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products. For the fiscal year ended December 27, 2020, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Amazon.com and Target Corporation and accounted for approximately 15%, 10% and 8%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenues. In the U.S. and Canada segment, approximately 59% of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers. In 2020, ecommerce sales represented a significant portion of overall sales to these customers as consumers increasingly purchased our products online as compared to through in-store shopping due to the shutdown and limited access to retail stores during the Covid-19 pandemic. Ecommerce sales have resulted in retailers holding less inventory, 30Table of Contentswhich has caused us to adjust our supply chain. Failure to continue to adapt our supply chain and successfully fulfill ecommerce sales could harm our business. Due to our customer concentration, if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing business with us, significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us, favor competitors or new entrants, increase their direct competition with us by expanding their private-label business, change their purchasing patterns, impose unexpected fees on us, alter the manner in which they promote our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products, or return substantial amounts of our products, our business may be harmed. Our customers do not make binding long-term commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders. Any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products. In addition, increased concentration among our customers could negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers. Furthermore, as we experienced with the bankruptcy of Toys“R”Us, the failure or lack of success of a significant retail customer could negatively impact our revenues and profitability.Our substantial business, sales and manufacturing operations outside the U.S. subject us to risks associated with international operations.We operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the U.S. Over time, we expect our international sales and operations to continue to grow both in dollars and as a percentage of our overall business as a result of a key business strategy to expand our presence in emerging and underserved international markets, such as Eastern Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia. Additionally, we utilize third-party manufacturers primarily located in the Far East, including China, India and Vietnam, to produce most of our products. These international operations, including operations in emerging markets, have unique consumer preferences and business climates, present additional challenges and are subject to risks that may significantly harm our sales, increase our costs or otherwise damage our business, including:•Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;•The imposition of tariffs, quotas, border adjustment taxes or other protectionist measures;•Potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross border transactions, which can materially increase our taxes and other costs of doing business; •Political instability, civil unrest and economic instability;•Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights; •Implications or difficulties arising out of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union;•Complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies and the evolution of laws and regulations and related enforcement;•Difficulties understanding the retail climate, consumer trends, local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be quite different from the U.S.;•Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and cost in recovering therefrom; •Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another, including port congestion, strikes and other transportation delays and interruptions;•Increased investment and operational complexity to make our products compatible with systems in various countries and compliant with local laws; and•Changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing business internationally.Because of the importance of international sales, sourcing and manufacturing to our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business and operating in an environment with these risks.31Table of ContentsOur reliance on third-party manufacturers to produce our products, particularly in China, India and Vietnam, presents risks to our business.All of our products are manufactured by third-party manufacturers, the majority of which are located in China, with a significant amount of our product sourcing also coming from manufacturers in India and Vietnam. Should changes be necessary, our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted, over a significant period of time, to alternative sources of supply. If we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product lines due to economic, political, civil, labor or other factors beyond our control, including work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, natural disasters, adverse health conditions or pandemics, our ability to manufacture would be adversely affected and our operations may be substantially disrupted, potentially for a significant period of time. This delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business while alternative sources of supply are secured.Given that our toy manufacturing is conducted by third-party manufacturers, health conditions, such as the coronavirus, and other factors affecting social and economic activity where our manufacturers are located may affect the movement of people and products into and from those locations to our major markets, including North America and Europe. Further, increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in markets where we manufacture, could also have a significant negative impact on our operations, revenues and earnings. Prolonged disputes or slowdowns at west coast or other ports can negatively impact both the time and cost of transporting goods into the U.S. Natural disasters or health pandemics, such as Covid-19, impacting our manufacturers had and can have a significant negative impact on our business.Further, the imposition of tariffs, border adjustment taxes, trade sanctions or other regulations or economic penalties by the U.S. or the European Union against products imported by us from China or other foreign countries, or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with China or other foreign countries in which we operate, could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the U.S. or Europe, shift more orders from direct import to domestic sales, put additional shipping and warehousing burdens on us, delay the time of our sales to retailers, result in lost sales, and otherwise harm our business. Additionally, the suspension of the operations of a third-party manufacturer by government inspectors in China or another market in which we source products could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales.We have been working over the last several years to reduce our reliance on manufacturing in China, such as by moving production of certain products to facilities in other countries like India, Vietnam and Mexico, as well as by increasing production of our products in other markets, including in the U.S. We plan to continue those efforts in future years, but cannot guarantee we will be as successful in these efforts as we plan. Furthermore, many of these newer production facilities, such as in India and Vietnam, raise other risks in that we are working with vendors who have not been manufacturing products like ours for as long as historical vendors in China. That means these new vendors must successfully develop the capability to manufacture our products to the quality and safety standards we require and within the tight timeframe required by our customers.We require our third-party manufacturers to comply with our Global Business Ethics Principles, which are designed to prevent products manufactured for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions. Notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them, there is always a risk that one or more of our third-party manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such non-compliance. Any failure of our third-party manufacturers to comply with labor, consumer, product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation, harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us.Our dependence on third-party relationships with studios, content producers and distribution channels to develop and distribute entertainment content is critical to our entertainment operations.We rely on third party relationships with studios, content producers and distribution channels to develop and distribute entertainment content. For example, eOne relies on third‑party content producers and distribution channels to sell and distribute films and television programs. Our financial performance may be adversely affected by our relationships with these studios, content producers and distribution channels. Some of our content producers are affiliates of major studios that have their own distribution capability in the markets in which we operate, and some of our distribution channels produce their own content or are affiliated with other content producers. These third-party content producers and distribution channels may decide, or be required by their respective parent companies, to use their intra‑company distribution or content production capabilities rather than contracting with us. Our business may be harmed if the studios, content producers and distribution channels with which we work stop or reduce the amount of work they do with us or otherwise demand less favorable terms to us.32Table of ContentsWe have entered into long-term output licensing agreements for the acquisition of content and these agreements may not be renewed on favorable terms or at all.We have entered into long-term agreements to acquire films with producers. These agreements require us to pay for films released by the relevant studio at rates typically calculated by reference to the film’s budget. In addition, we have entered into long term contracts for the acquisition of certain of our television programs. As these contracts expire, we may choose to renew, renegotiate or terminate them. These arrangements are also terminable by the counterparty under certain circumstances. If we are unable to renew or replace them on acceptable terms, we may not be able to replace this content with other film acquisitions. Even if these contracts are renewed or replaced, the terms on which we acquire content may be less favorable than the terms of our current agreements and the financial success or quantity of films and television programs we acquire through these long-term contracts may decrease. There can also be no assurance that revenues based on these long-term contracts will exceed the costs of acquiring the films or television programs. Our success is dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees.Our officers and employees are at the heart of all of our efforts. It is their skill, innovation and hard work that drive our success. We compete with many other potential employers in recruiting, hiring and retaining our management team and our many other skilled officers and employees around the world. In the entertainment industry, experienced personnel and top creative talent are in high demand and competition for their talent is intense. The impact of failing to retain key employees can be high due to loss of key knowledge and relationships, loss of creative talent, lost productivity, hiring and training costs, all of which could result in lower profitability. We cannot guarantee that we will recruit, hire or retain the key personnel we need to succeed.We have experienced significant changes in our workforce due in part to our acquisition of eOne, restructuring efforts, recruitment and hiring of new skill sets required for our evolving global business, and retirement of certain executives. The changes in our employee composition, both in terms of global distribution and in skill sets, have required changes in our business. Our loss of key management or other employees, or our inability to hire talented people with the skill sets we need for our changing business, could significantly harm our business.If we fail to develop diverse top talent, we may be unable to compete and our business may be harmed. To compete successfully, we must continuously develop a diverse group of talented people. We promote a diverse and inclusive work environment. To that end, we have set goals and objectives with respect to hiring and retention of talented, diverse employees, which we believe will foster new ideas and perspectives that will benefit our business. Competition for diverse talent is intense. We cannot guarantee we will achieve our goals or that our actions will result in expected benefits to our business. Our entertainment business could be adversely affected by strikes or other union job actions.Our entertainment business is dependent in part upon highly specialized union members who are essential to the production of films and television programs. A strike by, or a lockout of, one or more of the unions that provide personnel essential to the production of films or television programs could delay or halt our ongoing production activities. Such a halt or delay, depending on the length of time, could cause a delay or interruption in our release of new films and television programs, which could harm our entertainment business.Our business may be harmed if we are unable to protect our critical intellectual property rights.Our intellectual property, including our trademarks and tradenames, copyrights, patents, and rights under our license agreements and other agreements that establish our intellectual property rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, is of critical value. We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property in the U.S. and around the world. From time to time, third parties have challenged, and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our intellectual property in the U.S. and around the world. In addition, our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights, as well as the risk of unauthorized third parties copying and distributing our entertainment content or leaking portions of planned entertainment content. We may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. Similarly, third parties may claim ownership over certain aspects of our products, productions or other intellectual property. Our failure to successfully protect our intellectual property rights could significantly harm our business and competitive position.33Table of ContentsFailure to successfully operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability.We rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications to manage many aspects of our business, including product development, management of our supply chain, sale and delivery of our products, royalty and financial reporting and various other processes and transactions. We are critically dependent on the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems and related back-up systems. These systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, malware and other cybersecurity breaches, catastrophic events such as hurricanes, fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees or partners. The efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems, including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully. The failure of our information systems or third-party hosted technology to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business, require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability.If our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed.We and our business partners maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world and in the cloud. This data relates to all aspects of our business, including current and future products and entertainment under development, and also contains certain customer, consumer, supplier, partner and employee data. We maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data, but notwithstanding such protective measures, there is a risk of intrusion, cyber-attacks or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data. In addition, we provide confidential and proprietary information to our third-party business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business. While we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data, and where applicable, that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties, those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of such data. Any compromise of the confidential data of our customers, consumers, suppliers, partners, employees or ourselves, or failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of or damage to this data through breach of our information technology systems or other means could substantially disrupt our operations, harm our customers, consumers, employees and other business partners, damage our reputation, violate applicable laws and regulations, subject us to potentially significant costs and liabilities and result in a loss of business that could be material.Global and Economic Risks Relating to our BusinessThe global coronavirus outbreak or other similar outbreaks of communicable infections, diseases, or public health pandemics in the markets in which we and our employees, consumers, customers, partners, licensees, suppliers and manufacturers operate, could substantially harm our business.The global outbreak of the coronavirus which continues to adversely impact global populations, and any other outbreaks of communicable infections, diseases or other adverse public health conditions in markets in which we, our employees, consumers, customers, partners, licensees, licensors, suppliers and manufacturers operate, could have a significant negative impact on our business, revenues and profitability. The occurrence of these types of events can result, and in the case of the coronavirus has resulted in, disruptions and damage to our business, caused by a number of factors:•the negative impact to our ability to design, develop, manufacture and ship product as well as produce and distribute entertainment content;•delays in entertainment content releases from our partners and licensors, or changes in release plans, that can adversely impact our product sales; examples of releases that have been delayed include Disney’s MULAN, MARVEL’S BLACK WIDOW, SONY PICTURES GHOSTBUSTERS AFTERLIFE and SNAKE EYES: G.I. JOE ORIGINS;•the negative impact on consumer purchasing behavior and availability of product to consumers, including due to retail store closures, limited reopenings, shelter at home instructions and limitations on the capacity of ecommerce;•disruptions or restrictions on the ability of some of our employees, suppliers and manufacturers to work effectively, including due to illness, quarantines, government actions, and facility closures or other similar restrictions;34Table of Contents•temporary or permanent closures of, limited reopenings, or other restrictions on businesses, such as retail stores, in which our products and/or the products of our licensees are sold, as well as studios and theaters in which or for which we produce and distribute entertainment content; and•other negative effects of the coronavirus on our business, including increased risks of accounts receivable collection, bankruptcies of retailers, delays in payment and negotiations with customers or licensees over payment terms or the ability to perform under contracts or licenses.During 2020, due to the coronavirus, we experienced and could experience further disruptions in supply of product, which has been and can be driven by: manufacturing and other work stoppages, factory and other business closings, slowdowns or delays in places where a substantial portion of our manufacturing occurs; restrictions and limitations placed on workers and factories, including quarantines and other limitations on the ability to travel and return to work; and shortages or delays in production or shipment of products or raw materials. Even as facilities reopen or workers return to work, such reopenings and returns have been and we expect will continue to be measured and gradual for some period of time so as to minimize the risk of further outbreaks of the virus, and that despite precautions further outbreaks may occur and result in future negative impacts.Certain aspects of our entertainment business have continued without significant disruption, such as development and pre-production work in our animation business. Other aspects of our entertainment business were significantly negatively impacted by the coronavirus. Specifically, scheduled live-action productions were delayed or postponed during much of 2020 due to the shutdown of production work and the closure or limited reopening of studios, theatrical releases have been delayed due to the closure or limited reopening of theaters, and in some cases, global releases moved to different media platforms, such as streaming services. Although productions have been reopening, on a limited basis, depending on the future impact of the coronavirus our entertainment business may continue to be adversely affected in the future.The negative impact to demand can be caused by delays in or reduced purchases from customers and consumers who may be reluctant or unable to leave home or otherwise shop in a normal manner due to restrictions on or closure, either temporarily or permanently, of many retail stores and hobby stores in which our products are sold. Demand has been and may be further impacted due to consumers’ lower discretionary income due to reduced or limited work or unemployment, which has increased dramatically due to the coronavirus.Due the nature of our global business, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our performance based on the progress of different countries in controlling the coronavirus and the maturity of ecommerce platforms in those markets. For example, we experienced substantial business difficulties in certain countries in Latin America, which have continued to be adversely affected by the number of coronavirus cases, resulting in substantial retail disruption, and which, have not historically had large ecommerce businesses. Further, countries that may currently be controlling the virus may suffer setbacks as markets, businesses, schools and communities reopen, thereby causing further restrictions or closures of retail stores, studios and production work, all of which could adversely impact our business. Since mid-March 2020, most of our workforce has been working remotely. Reopening of our offices has begun on a limited basis, and we continue to actively work on a plan to safely bring additional workers back to the office. While most of our workforce has been able to work remotely in an effective manner, certain employees whose job responsibilities require in person work, such as those whose job it is to go into retail stores or are involved in design or production work, have seen reduced productivity and, in some cases, have been furloughed or terminated. We regularly communicate and engage with our employees to minimize the disruption and stress of working remotely, provide flexibility and ensure that our employees are getting access to information and accommodations as we continue to plan for a successful and safe reentry to the workplace. We believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available at this time. During this time of uncertainty, however, we are managing our expenses to further preserve our liquidity and we are closely monitoring our customers’ health and collectability of receivables, with some customers having difficulty making payments or requesting extended payment terms at a time when retailers are experiencing challenges and some have filed for bankruptcy.The impact of coronavirus outbreak continues to be fluid and uncertain, and while vaccines are being rolled out, it is still difficult to forecast the final impact it could have on our future operations. If our business experiences prolonged occurrence of adverse public health conditions due to the coronavirus or other similar outbreaks, we believe our business could be substantially harmed.35Table of ContentsChanges in U.S., global or regional economic conditions could harm our business and financial performance.Our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending in the markets in which we operate. Recessions, credit crises and other economic downturns, or disruptions in credit markets, in the U.S. and in other markets in which we operate can result in lower levels of economic activity, lower employment levels, less consumer disposable income, and lower consumer confidence. Similarly, reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers, such as their homes or stock market investments, can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power. Any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products and entertainment. This in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability.In addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues during times of economic difficulty, in an effort to maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price of our products, increase our promotional spending and/or sales allowances, take other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products, or incur expenses to develop and produce entertainment offerings with no assurance of success. Those steps may lower our net revenues or increase our costs, thereby decreasing our operating margins and lowering our profitability. Other adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we and our employees, consumers, customers, suppliers and manufacturers operate could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products, and lower our revenues, margins and profitability.Various economic conditions in the markets we, our employees, consumers, customers, suppliers and manufacturers operate, could have a significant negative impact on our revenues, profitability and business. The occurrence of adverse economic conditions can result in manufacturing and other work stoppages, slowdowns and delays; shortages or delays in production or shipment of products or raw materials; delays or reduced purchases from customers and consumers; and other factors that cause increases in costs or delay in revenues. Significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers, such as gasoline, home heating fuels, or groceries, may reduce household spending on the discretionary products and entertainment we offer. Weakened economic conditions, lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may also significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products and spending on entertainment. Economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks, wars and other conflicts, natural disasters, increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs, or the prospect of such events. Such a weakened economic and business climate, as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate, could harm our revenues and profitability.Our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products, but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit. Rising fuel and raw material prices, for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components, increased transportation costs, and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products, which in turn may reduce our margins, reduce our profitability and harm our business.Financial Risks Relating to our BusinessOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate due to seasonality in our business. Sales of our toys, games and other entertainment products are extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from September through December in anticipation of the holiday season. This seasonality has increased over time, as retailers become more and more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response or just in time inventory management techniques, including the use of automated inventory replenishment programs. Further, ecommerce continues to grow significantly and accounts for a higher portion of the ultimate sales of our products to consumers. Ecommerce retailers tend to hold less inventory and take inventory closer to the time of sale to consumers than traditional retailers. As a result, customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers, such as us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. While these techniques reduce a retailer’s investment in inventory, they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier. This can also result in our losing significant revenues and earnings if our supply chain is unable to supply product to our customers when they want it. Tariffs can exacerbate this negative impact by causing retailers to shift from direct import to domestic orders, further pressuring our supply chain as we experienced in 2019.The level of inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us. If we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional products to fully meet consumer demand. 36Table of ContentsAdditionally, the logistics of supplying more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance. This seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital, mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers. Our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand, resulting in under producing popular items and/or overproducing less popular items, would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations.Our entertainment business is also subject to seasonal variations based on the timing of television, film, streaming and digital content releases. Release dates are determined by several factors, including the timing of holiday periods, geographical release dates and competition in the market.As a result of the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year, by unforeseen events such as a natural disaster, a terrorist attack, economic shock or pandemic that harms the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods, particularly from the Far East, during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season.If we incurred any significant impairment charges, our net earnings would be reduced. Declines in the profitability of acquired brands or our decision to reduce our focus or exit these brands may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge. Similarly, declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in a write-down of our goodwill and consequently harm our results of operations. We may incur impairments if the films and television programs we acquire and produce do not perform well enough to recoup our acquisition, production, marketing and distribution costs.We incur significant costs to acquire, produce and distribute entertainment content. Most agreements to acquire content for distribution require minimum guarantees against royalties. The minimum guarantees are derived from our estimate of net revenues that will be realized from our distribution of the title in the relevant markets, and actual results may differ from those estimates. If sales do not meet our original estimates, we may:  •not recognize the expected gross margin or net profit; •not recoup our minimum guarantees or distribution expenses; •record accelerated amortization and/or fair value write‑downs of minimum guarantees paid; or •not recoup the additional funds and expenses invested to market films that we have produced or acquired.With respect to content we produce, we are required to amortize capitalized production costs based on estimated ultimate revenue as we recognize revenues from the associated films or television productions. Unamortized production costs are evaluated for impairment each reporting period on a project‑by‑project basis. If estimated remaining revenue is not sufficient to recover the unamortized production costs, the unamortized production costs will be written down to fair value. In any given quarter, if we lower our previous forecast with respect to total anticipated revenue from any individual film or other project, we may be required to accelerate amortization or record impairment charges with respect to the unamortized costs, even if we have previously recorded impairment charges for such film or other project. Such impairment and accelerated amortization charges and write‑offs could harm our financial results.Similarly, our business could be harmed by greater-than-expected costs, or unexpected delays or difficulties, associated with our investment in Discovery Family Channel, such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or in building advertising revenues for Discovery Family Channel. If the Discovery Family Channel is not successful our investments may become impaired, which could result in a write-down through net earnings.Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance.Our global operations mean we transact business in many different jurisdictions with many different currencies. As a result, if the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes, our financial results as reported in U.S. dollars, may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected. Similarly, our expenses can be significantly impacted, in U.S. dollar terms, by exchange rates, meaning the profitability of our business in U.S. dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control. Depreciation in key 37Table of Contentscurrencies may have a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings as they are reported in U.S. dollars.Our indebtedness may limit our availability of cash, cause us to divert cash to fund debt service payments or may it more difficult to take certain other actions.We incurred significant indebtedness to finance our acquisition of eOne. The increase in our debt service obligations resulting from additional indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In particular, our increased indebtedness could:•make it more difficult and/or costly for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due, particularly during adverse economic and industry conditions, because a decrease in revenues or increase in costs could cause cash flow from operations to be insufficient to make scheduled debt service payments;•require a substantial portion of our available cash to be used for debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of our cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, acquisitions or other strategic opportunities, dividend payments, share repurchases and other general corporate purposes;•result in downgrades in the credit ratings on our indebtedness, which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms or at all (including in order to refinance our other debt), increase the interest rates under our credit facilities and under any new indebtedness we may incur;•make it more difficult for us to raise capital to fund working capital, make capital expenditures, pay dividends, pursue strategic initiatives or for other purposes;•result in higher interest expense, which could be further increased in case of current or future borrowings subject to variable rates of interest;•require that materially adverse terms, conditions or covenants be placed on us under our debt instruments, which could include, for example, limitations on additional borrowings or limitations on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock or make investments, any of which could hinder our access to capital markets or our flexibility in the conduct of our business and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse competitive industry conditions; and•jeopardize our ability to pay our indebtedness if our business experienced a severe downturn.If we were unable to obtain or service our other external financings, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome, our business would be harmed.Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our working capital needs, particularly those in the third and fourth quarters, we may rely on our commercial paper program, revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital. We currently have a commercial paper program which, subject to market conditions, and availability under our committed revolving credit facility, allows us to issue up to $1,000.0 million in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a source of working capital funding and liquidity. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms, or at all, at any given point in time.We also have a revolving credit agreement which provides for a $1,500.0 million committed revolving credit facility. The credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility. These restrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial, operating and strategic flexibility. Non-compliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines, a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations.Not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing, but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing. In times of severe economic downturn and/or distress in the credit markets, it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us. In such a situation, it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities, and it might not be possible to find alternative sources of funding.We also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to time, through the issuance of debt securities. Our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interest rates, and the overall condition of the 38Table of Contentsfinancial and credit markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities. The failure to receive financing on desirable terms, or at all, could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities.If we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance our outstanding debt or face default. We cannot guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms, or at all.If we are unable to obtain production financing, on favorable terms or at all, we may be unable to produce certain films and television programs or if we do so, would have to produce them at higher cost and greater risk to us.With the acquisition of eOne we expect to continue to use production financing to finance certain of our productions, which eOne has historically been able to obtain on commercially reasonable terms. The use of third party financing also reduces the risk to us and reduces the demand on our cash and liquidity. In the event that we are unable to provide eOne with appropriate financing or if third party production financing becomes unavailable on reasonable commercial terms or at all, we may not have sufficient alternative funding sources available to finance a particular production. In this case, we may not be able to produce the films and television programs we plan to do, which could harm our business.Changes in, or differing interpretations of, income tax laws and rules, and changes in our geographic operating results, may impact our effective tax rate.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in various international tax jurisdictions. We also conduct business activities between our operating units in various jurisdictions and we are subject to transfer pricing rules in the countries in which we operate. There is some degree of uncertainty and subjectivity in complying with transfer pricing rules. Our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in, or the interpretation of, tax laws or by changes in the amount of revenue and earnings we derive, or are determined to derive by tax authorities, from jurisdictions with differing tax rates.In addition, we may be subject to tax examinations by federal, state, and international jurisdictions, and these examinations can result in significant tax findings if the tax authorities interpret the application of laws and rules differently than we do or disagree with the intercompany rates we are applying. We assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from tax uncertainties. While we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome of these uncertain tax benefits, or results of possible current or future tax examinations, may differ from our estimates and may have a significant adverse impact on our business and operating results.If we lose the Canadian status of Entertainment One Canada Ltd., we could lose licenses, incentives and tax credits.Through our acquisition of eOne, we indirectly acquired the economic interests in Entertainment One Canada Ltd., a Canadian corporation (“EOCL”). EOCL is able to benefit from a number of licenses, incentive programs and Canadian government tax credits as a result of it being “Canadian controlled” as defined in the Investment Canada Act. We have taken measures to ensure that EOCL’s Canadian status is maintained. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to continue to maintain EOCL's Canadian status. The loss of EOCL’s Canadian status could harm our business, including the possible loss of future incentive programs and clawback of funding previously provided to EOCL.Governmental and Legal Risks Relating to our BusinessWe are subject to various government regulations, violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business. In addition, we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls, which could harm our business.We are subject to significant government regulations, including, in the U.S., under The Consumer Products Safety Act, The Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and The Flammable Fabrics Act, as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets. In addition, certain of our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration or similar international authorities. Advertising to children is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and a host of other agencies globally, and the collection of information from children under the age of 13 is subject to the provisions of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and other privacy laws around the world. The collection of personally identifiable information from anyone, including adults, is under increasing regulation in many markets, such as the 39Table of ContentsGeneral Data Protection Regulation adopted by the European Union. While we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts and regulations, we cannot assure you that we will be in compliance and, if we fail to comply with these requirements or other regulations enacted in the future, we could be subject to fines, liabilities or sanctions which could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall. While costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business, the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant. In addition, any product recall, regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm the reputation of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations.As a large multinational corporation, we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world, including antitrust, employment, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, environmental regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition.Our entertainment business involves risks of liability claims for media content, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.As a distributor and producer of media content, we may face potential liability for defamation, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials distributed. These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against producers and distributors of media content. Any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.From time to time, we are involved in litigation, arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense.As a large multinational corporation, we are subject, from time to time, to regulatory investigations, litigation and arbitration disputes, including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of products that have been or may be developed by us, claims by third parties that our products infringe upon or misuse such third parties’ property or rights, or claims by former employees for employment related matters. Because the outcome of litigation, arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant cost for us and harm our business. The fact that we operate in a significant number of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements. Any successful claim against us could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations"
9,HAS,HASBRO INC,2020-02-27,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
.In evaluating our business, the risks described below, as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission should be considered carefully. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business. The occurrence of any of these events or circumstances could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flow or results of operations. This report contains forward-looking statements; please refer to the cautionary statements made under the heading ""Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" for more information on the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements.Risks Related to Our Business Our strategy involves focusing on franchise and key partner brands, and successfully developing, or in the case of partner brands, successfully working with our partners to develop, those brands across our brand blueprint in a wide array of innovative toys and games, consumer products, storytelling and digital experiences. If we are not successful in developing and expanding these critical brands our business will suffer.We have made a strategic decision to focus on fewer, larger global brands with an emphasis on developing our franchise and key partner brands, which we view as having the largest global potential. As we concentrate our efforts on a more select group of brands, we believe we can gain additional leverage and enhance the consumer experience. But this focus also means that our future success depends disproportionately on our and our partners’ ability to successfully develop this select group of brands across our brand blueprint and to maintain and extend the reach and relevance of these brands to global consumers in a wide array of markets. This strategy has required us to acquire, build and develop competencies in new areas, including storytelling, digital content and consumer products. Acquiring, developing and growing these competencies has required significant effort, time and money, with no assurance of success.Our franchise and partner brands account for the substantial majority of our revenues. If we are unable to successfully maintain and develop our franchise and key partner brands in the future, continue to drive their relevance to consumers and grow sales of products and storytelling experiences based on those brands, our revenues and profits will decline and our business performance will suffer. In addition to continuing to grow and develop our existing franchise brands, successfully executing our brand strategy requires us to successfully develop other brands, such as POWER RANGERS which was acquired in 2018, and PEPPA PIG, PJ MASKS and RICKY ZOOM, which were acquired as part of our acquisition of eOne as of December 30, 2019. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to do this successfully.Consumer interests change rapidly, making it difficult to create storytelling experiences and to design and develop products and entertainment offerings which will be popular with children, families and audiences, or to maintain the popularity of successful products and brands.The interests of children, families and audiences evolve extremely quickly and can change dramatically from year to year and by geography. To be successful, we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment content, products and play patterns which will capture consumers’ interests and imagination, and quickly develop and introduce innovative products and engaging entertainment which can compete successfully for consumers’ limited time, attention and spending. This challenge is more difficult with the ever-increasing utilization of technology and digital media in entertainment offerings, and the increasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers. Evolving consumer tastes and shifting interests, coupled with an ever-changing and expanding pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for consumer interest and acceptance, create an environment in which some products and entertainment offerings can fail to achieve consumer acceptance, and other products and entertainment offerings can be popular during a certain period of time but then be rapidly replaced. As a result, entertainment products and properties often have short consumer life cycles.Consumer acceptance of our or our partners’ entertainment offerings is also affected by outside factors, such as critical reviews, promotions, the quality and acceptance of films and television programs and content released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions and public tastes generally, all of which could change rapidly and most of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that films and television programs we produce or distribute will obtain favorable reviews or ratings, that films we distribute or produce will perform well at the box office or in ancillary markets or that broadcasters will license the rights to broadcast any of our television programs in development or renew licenses to broadcast programs in our library.14Table of ContentsIf we devote time and resources to developing and marketing entertainment and products that consumers do not accept or do not find interesting enough to buy in sufficient quantities to be profitable to us, our revenues and profits may decline and our business performance may be damaged. Similarly, if our product offerings and entertainment fail to correctly anticipate consumer interests, our revenues and earnings will be reduced.The challenge of continuously developing and offering products and storytelling experiences that are sought after by children is compounded by the sophistication of today’s children and the increasing array of technology and entertainment offerings available to them.Children are increasingly utilizing electronic offerings such as tablet devices and mobile phones and they are expanding their interests to a wider array of innovative, technology-driven entertainment products and digital and social media offerings at younger and younger ages. Our products compete with the offerings of consumer electronics companies, digital media and social media companies. To meet this challenge we, and our competitors, are investing in, designing and marketing products which incorporate more technology, seek to integrate digital and analog play, and aim to capitalize on new play patterns and increased consumption of digital and social media.Costs associated with designing, developing and producing technologically advanced or sophisticated toy products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products, such as board games and action figures. The ability to sell enough of these advanced products, at prices high enough to recoup our costs and make a profit, is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment products and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions. As a result, we can face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs and we may lose money on the development and sale of these products. Additionally, designing, developing and producing technologically advanced or sophisticated products requires different competencies and follows different timelines than traditional toys and games. Delays in the design, development or production of these products incorporated into or associated with traditional toys and games could have a significant impact on our ability to successfully offer such products. In addition, the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than for our other products. This pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games.With the increasing array of technology and competitive entertainment offerings, we cannot guarantee that:•any of our brands, products or product lines will achieve popularity or continue to be popular; •any property for which we have a significant license will achieve or sustain popularity; •any new products or product lines we introduce will be considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate market acceptance; or •any product’s life cycle or sales quantities will be sufficient to permit us to profitably recover our development, manufacturing, marketing, royalties (including royalty advances and guarantees) and other costs of producing, marketing and selling the product. Technological development, including changes in entertainment delivery formats, drives frequent changes within the film and television industry and our failure to respond to or capitalize on these changes could harm our business.The entertainment industry experiences frequent change driven by technological development, including developments with respect to the formats through which films, television programming and recorded music are delivered to consumers.  With rapid technological changes and dramatically expanded digital content offerings, the scale and scope of these changes have accelerated in recent years.  For example, consumers are increasingly accessing television and film content on streaming and digital content networks, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, which has caused significant disruption to the retail distribution of films, television programming and recorded music.  We may also lose opportunities to capitalize on changing market dynamics, technological innovations or consumer tastes if we do not adapt our content offerings or distribution capabilities in a timely manner.  The overall effect that technological development and new digital distribution platforms have on the revenue and profits we derive from our entertainment content, and the additional costs associated with changing markets, media platforms and technologies, is unpredictable.  If we fail to accurately assess and effectively respond to changes in technology and consumer behavior in the entertainment industry, our business may be harmed.Engaging storytelling across media is an increasingly important factor for driving brand awareness and successfully building brands.Entertainment media, in forms such as television, films, digital content and other media, have become increasingly important platforms for consumers to experience our brands and our partners’ brands and the success, 15Table of Contentsor lack of success, of such media efforts can significantly impact the demand for our products and our financial performance. We spend considerable resources in designing and developing products in conjunction with planned media releases, both by our partners and our own media releases. Not only our efforts, but the efforts of third parties, such as licensors, film studios, content producers and distribution channels with whom we work, heavily impact the amount, content and timing of media development, release dates and the ultimate consumer interest in and success of these media efforts.In 2019, for example, we developed and marketed significant product lines tied to the film releases by key partners of a number of properties, including DISNEY’S FROZEN II, MARVEL’S AVENGERS: ENDGAME, MARVEL’S CAPTAIN MARVEL, MARVEL’S SPIDER-MAN and STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER. Those films are developed and released by our partners and our partners control the content and schedule for such films. Other key partner product lines we offer, such as DISNEY PRINCESS, DISNEY'S DESCENDANTS and BEYBLADE, depend on television support by our partners for their successes.Similarly, we are developing and marketing products for entertainment in which we play a more active role in developing or develop ourselves, such as TRANSFORMERS, POWER RANGERS and MY LITTLE PONY.  In the future, we expect to have an even greater role in developing our own entertainment offerings for our brands, including those in our vault, through eOne’s expertise, experience and relationships in the entertainment industry, as we work together to unlock value in our brands.   If films, television shows, or any other key entertainment content for which we develop and market products are not as successful as we and our partners anticipate, our revenues and earnings will fall.The ultimate timing and success of such projects is critically dependent on the efforts and schedules of our licensors, studio, content, distribution and media partners. We do not fully control when or if any particular film projects will be greenlit, developed or released, and our licensors or media partners may change their plans with respect to projects and release dates or cancel development all together. This can make it difficult for us to get feature films developed, plan future entertainment slates and to successfully develop and market products in conjunction with future films and other media releases, given the lengthy lead times involved in product development and successful marketing efforts, and the fact that third party partners of ours may decide not to develop such entertainment.When we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases, those statements are based on our current plans and expectations. Unforeseen factors may increase the cost of these releases, delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation. Any delay or cancellation of planned product development work, introductions, or media support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business.Outbreaks of communicable infections or diseases, or other public health pandemics, such as the global coronavirus outbreak currently being experienced, in the markets in which we and our employees, consumers, customers, suppliers and manufacturers operate, could substantially harm our business. Disease outbreaks and other public health conditions, such as the global outbreak of the coronavirus currently being experienced, in markets in which we, our employees, consumers, customers, suppliers and manufacturers operate, could have a significant negative impact on our revenues, profitability and business. The occurrence of these types of events can result, and in the case of the coronavirus has resulted in, disruptions and damage to our business, caused by both the negative impact to our ability to design, develop, manufacture and ship product (the supply side impact) and the negative impact on consumer purchasing behavior (the demand side impact).  The negative impact to supply can be driven by: manufacturing and other work stoppages, factory and other business closings, slowdowns or delays, including in China where a substantial portion of our manufacturing occurs; restrictions and limitations placed on workers and factories, including quarantines and other limitations on the ability to travel and return to work; and shortages or delays in production or shipment of products or raw materials. The negative impact to demand can be caused by delays in or reduced purchases from customers and consumers who may not be able to leave home or otherwise shop in a normal manner, and may have lower discretionary income due to reduced or limited work. While we have developed and continue to develop plans to help mitigate the negative impact of the coronavirus to our business, the efforts will not completely prevent our business from being adversely affected, and the longer the outbreak impacts supply and demand the more negative the impact it will have on our business, revenues and earnings, and the more limited our ability will be to try and make up for delayed or lost product development, production and sales.  The coronavirus outbreak continues to be fluid and uncertain, making it difficult to forecast the final impact it could have on our future operations.  If our business experiences prolonged occurrence of adverse public health conditions, such as the coronavirus, we believe our business could be substantially harmed.16Table of ContentsWe depend on third party relationships with studios, content producers and distribution channels to develop and distribute entertainment content and those relationships are critical to our operations.Under our relationship with Paramount, and now through our ownership of eOne, we are playing a more significant role in the production and financing of films based on our properties. This has the advantage of giving us more input as to what and when properties are developed into films, and can allow us to earn a greater return from successful films, but it also increases the money we directly spend on film production and puts that investment at risk. If our films are not as successful as we anticipate they will be, or if we are not able to produce and distribute films according to the schedule we have planned, due to creative or other difficulties or delays, our financial performance will be negatively impacted.Additionally, eOne obtains distribution rights for films from third‑party content producers and produce television programs sold through a number of distribution channels.  Our financial performance may be adversely affected by our relationships with these content producers and distribution channels.  Some of these content producers are affiliates of major studios that have their own distribution capability in the markets in which we operate, and some of these distribution channels produce their own content or are affiliated with other content producers.  These content producers and distribution channels may decide, or be required by their respective parent companies, to use their intra‑company distribution or content production capabilities rather than contracting with us for distribution or content production.  Our business may be harmed if the content producers and distribution channels with which we work stop licensing content to us, or purchasing content from us, on favorable terms or at all and we are unable to establish new relationships to ensure the acquisition and sale of content in a timely and efficient manner.The play and entertainment industry and consumer products industry are highly competitive and the barriers to entry are low. If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors or with our retailers’ private label toy products, our revenues, market share and profitability could decline.The play and entertainment industry and the consumer products industry are, and will continue to be, highly competitive. We compete in the U.S. and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers, marketers, and sellers of analog toys and games, digital gaming products, digital media, products which combine analog and digital play, and other entertainment and consumer products, as well as with retailers who offer such products under their own private labels. In addition, we compete with other companies who are focused on building their brands across multiple product and consumer categories. Across our business, we face competitors who are constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends, seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers, and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase. In 2018, for example, our NERF branded products faced significantly increased competition from both newer entrants into the blaster space, as well as from private label offerings from major retailers. A number of these competitors sought to gain market share by offering products with less innovation than our products at price points below our products, particularly by offering blasters in the under $20 retail price range.In addition to existing competitors, the barriers to entry for new participants in the children’s and family entertainment industry and in the consumer products industry are low, and the increasing importance of digital media and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest, has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets, and has broadened the array of companies we compete with. New participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time. These existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences. Our competitors’ products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products, lower our revenues and lower our profitability.In recent years, retailers have also developed their own private-label products that directly compete with the products of traditional manufacturers and brand owners. Some retail chains that are our customers sell private-label children’s and family entertainment products designed, manufactured and branded by the retailers themselves. These products may be sold at prices lower than our prices for comparable products, which may result in lower purchases of our products by these retailers and may reduce our market share.We face competition from major film studios and television production companies as well as other independent distributors and independent content producers.Our entertainment business competes with other companies that produce and distribute films and television programs.  For example, the Discovery Family Channel, our cable television joint venture with Discovery Communications, Inc. in the U.S., competes with a number of other children’s television networks for viewers, 17Table of Contentsadvertising revenue and distribution fees.  Our programming distributed both domestically and internationally, and Allspark Animation’s and Allspark Pictures’ releases, compete with content from many other parties.  Entertainment One, as an independent distributor and producer, competes with major U.S. and international studios, that release a large number of films annually and command a significant share of box office revenues and television airtime, as well as other independent film and television production or distribution companies.Many of the major U.S. studios are part of large, diversified corporate groups with a variety of other operations, including television networks and cable channels that can provide both in‑house distribution capability and varied sources of earnings that may allow them to better offset fluctuations in the financial performance of their film and television operations.  Some of these competitors have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we do and may be able to compete aggressively on pricing in order to increase box office revenues and television airtime.  In addition, the resources of the major studios may give them an advantage in acquiring other businesses or assets, including film libraries, that we might also be interested in acquiring.  The competition we face may cause us to lose market share, achieve lower prices for our productions or pay more for third‑party content, any of which could harm our business.We cannot guarantee that our entertainment business will be successful. Lack of consumer interest in and acceptance of content developed by our entertainment business, and products related to that content, could significantly harm our business. An inability to develop and introduce planned products, product lines and new brands in a timely and cost-effective manner may damage our business.In developing products, product lines and new brands we have anticipated dates for the associated product and brand introductions. When we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a particular product, product line or brand at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development, implementation, and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to manufacture, source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a cost-effective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands. This risk is heightened by our customers’ compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business. Further, ecommerce and omni-channel is growing significantly and accounting for a higher portion of the ultimate sales of our products to consumers. Ecommerce retailers tend to hold less inventory and take inventory closer to the time of sale to consumers than traditional retailers. The risk is also exacerbated by the increasing sophistication of many of the products we are designing, and brands we are developing in terms of combining digital and analog technologies, and providing greater innovation and product differentiation. Unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process, significant increases in the planned cost of development, or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated, may reduce or eliminate the profitability of such products or, in some situations, may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued.Our success depends on our ongoing ability to successfully evolve our capabilities and business to meet the challenges of a changing retail landscape and to successfully develop new and expanded aspects of our business.Our success depends on our ability to continue evolving and transforming our business to address a changing global consumer landscape and retail environment, one in which online shopping accounts for an increasing percentage of total sales to consumers, digital first marketing is critical to garner and develop consumer interest, ecommerce focused companies like Amazon.com, Inc. are now among our largest customers, traditional brick and mortar retailers face challenges to their businesses from the disintermediation caused by the expanding prevalence of online shopping, and the presence of specialty toy retailers has been significantly reduced in many of our markets due to bankruptcies, such as that of Toys“R”Us, potentially reducing, at least in the shorter term, physical shelf space available to offer family entertainment properties. These market conditions require that we drive a digital-first orientation throughout our Company, adapt the way we produce and distribute our products to meet the needs of ecommerce retailers, and continue developing alternate retail channels to reach our consumers and recapture shelf space lost by specialty retailers.In addition to successfully driving our business in a changing retail landscape, our future success depends on developing new and expanded areas of our business.  Through our acquisition of eOne, we have made significant investments in our business that we believe can accelerate our brand blueprint strategy.  We have added global preschool brands, new storytelling capabilities, veteran leadership and expertise in television and film, which we believe can build and strengthen our brands and improve our franchise economics.  Another area we have invested considerable time and resources is our initiative to drive our DUNGEONS & DRAGONS brand through development 18Table of Contentsof digital gaming as well as our MAGIC: THE GATHERING brand through digital gaming and esports through our MAGIC: THE GATHERING ARENA online game and our MAGIC: THE GATHERING esports initiative. To grow our business through these and other initiatives we require different skills, investments and business strategies than more traditional areas of our business and our ability to successfully and profitably develop and deploy those skills and strategies, and drive those businesses, will be a major factor in achieving future success for our Company.  Failure to execute on our initiatives could harm our business.Our substantial business, sales and manufacturing operations outside the U.S. subject us to risks associated with international operations.We operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the U.S. We expect net revenues from our International segment to continue accounting for a significant portion of our revenues. In fact, over time, we expect our international sales and operations to continue to grow both in dollars and as a percentage of our overall business as a result of a key business strategy to expand our presence in emerging and underserved international markets, such as Eastern Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia. Additionally, we utilize third-party manufacturers primarily located in the Far East to produce most of our products. These international operations, including operations in emerging markets, have unique consumer preferences and business climates, present additional challenges and are subject to risks that may significantly harm our sales, increase our costs or otherwise damage our business, including:•Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;•The imposition of tariffs, quotas, border adjustment taxes or other protectionist measures;•Potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross border transactions, which can materially increase our taxes and other costs of doing business; •Political instability, civil unrest and economic instability;•Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights; •Complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies and the evolution of laws and regulations and related enforcement;•Difficulties understanding the retail climate, consumer trends, local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be quite different from the U.S.;•Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and cost in recovering therefrom; •Transportation delays and interruptions;•Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another, including port congestion, strikes and other transportation delays and interruptions;•Increased investment and operational complexity to make our products compatible with systems in various countries and compliant with local laws; and•Changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing business internationally.Tariffs increase the costs of our products and can lower sales. The current tariff environment, particularly the imposition or threat of tariffs on products manufactured in China for import into the U.S., has negatively impacted our business and may continue to negatively impact our business, sales and profitability. The threat and imposition of tariffs have resulted in the elimination of some direct import orders, where customers take ownership of products near the source of supply and import the product themselves into the U.S., in favor of shifting to domestic orders, which requires us to ship the products to the U.S., and import and warehouse the products prior to delivery to the customer. This shift to domestic orders raises the cost to us, can result in delays in the time of a sale, and may result in the potential loss of some orders entirely due to the lack of timely supply or other delays. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement actions to lessen the impact of tariffs imposed on our products, including any changes to our supply chain, logistics capabilities, sales policies or pricing of our products.Because of the importance of international sales, sourcing and manufacturing to our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business and operating in an environment with more tariffs.19Table of ContentsChanges in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance.Our global operations mean we produce and buy products, and sell products, in many different jurisdictions with many different currencies. As a result, if the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes, our financial results as reported in U.S. dollars, may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected. As an example, if the dollar appreciates 10% relative to a local currency for an international market in which we had $200 million of net revenues, the dollar value of those sales, as they are translated into U.S. dollars, would decrease by $20 million in our consolidated financial results. As such, we would recognize a $20 million decrease in our net revenues, even if the actual level of sales in the foreign market had not changed. Similarly, our expenses can be significantly impacted, in U.S. dollar terms, by exchange rates, meaning the profitability of our business in U.S. dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control. Depreciation in key currencies may have a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings as they are reported in U.S. dollars.Global and regional economic downturns that negatively impact the retail and credit markets, or that otherwise damage the financial health of our retail customers and consumers, or other factors negatively impacting retail sales, can harm our business and financial performance.We design, manufacture and market a wide variety of entertainment and consumer products worldwide through sales to our retail customers and directly to consumers. Our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending in the markets in which we operate. Recessions, credit crises and other economic downturns, or disruptions in credit markets, in the U.S. and in other markets in which our products are marketed and sold can result in lower levels of economic activity, lower employment levels, less consumer disposable income, and lower consumer confidence. Similarly, reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers, such as their homes or stock market investments, can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power. Any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products. This in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability.In addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our products during times of economic difficulty, in an effort to maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price of our products, increase our promotional spending and/or sales allowances, or take other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products. Those steps may lower our net revenues or increase our costs, thereby decreasing our operating margins and lowering our profitability. These challenges can be exacerbated if our customers accumulate excess retail inventories over time due to their purchases of our products exceeding sales of those products to ultimate consumers. It can then take us significant time, working with our retailers, to reduce those excess retail inventories, and, in the interim, our sales of new products can be negatively impacted.Other economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we and our employees, consumers, customers, suppliers and manufacturers operate, including rising commodity and fuel prices, higher labor costs, increased transportation costs, outbreaks of public health pandemics or other diseases or third party conduct could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products, and lower our revenues, margins and profitability.Various economic and public health conditions, such as the coronavirus as described above, in the markets we, our employees, consumers, customers, suppliers and manufacturers operate, could have a significant negative impact on our revenues, profitability and business. The occurrence of these types of events can result, and in the case of the coronavirus has resulted in, manufacturing and other work stoppages, slowdowns and delays; shortages or delays in production or shipment of products or raw materials; delays or reduced purchases from customers and consumers; and other factors that cause increases in costs or delay in revenues. Prolonged occurrences of adverse health conditions could harm our business.Significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers, such as gasoline, home heating fuels, or groceries, may reduce household spending on the discretionary branded-play entertainment products we offer. Weakened economic conditions, lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products. Economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks, wars and other conflicts, natural disasters, increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs, or the prospect of such events. Such a weakened economic and business climate, as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate, could harm our revenues and profitability.Our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products, but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit. Rising fuel and raw material prices, for 20Table of Contentspaperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components, increased transportation costs, and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products, which in turn may reduce our margins, reduce our profitability and harm our business.Other conditions, such as the unavailability of sufficient quantities of electrical components, may impede our ability to manufacture, source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis. Additional factors outside of our control could further delay our products or increase the cost we pay to produce such products. For example, work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic, such as the coronavirus, a natural disaster or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts, all could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product. Any of these factors could result in product delays, increased costs and/or lost sales for our products.The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit, may have an adverse effect on our operations. On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (""UK"") formally withdrew from the European Union (""EU""), entering a transitional period which is currently expected to end on December 31, 2020. During this transitional period, EU law will continue to apply in the UK while providing time for the UK and EU to negotiate the details of their future relationship.  If at the end of the transitional period, the UK leaves the European Union with no agreement, it may result in increased costs of goods imported into and exported from the UK and may decrease the profitability of our UK and other operations. We continue to closely monitor the negotiations and the impact to foreign currency markets, however we cannot predict the direction of Brexit-related developments or the impact of those developments on our European and eOne operations and the economies of the markets in which they operate.Our business depends, in large part, on the success of our key partner brands and on our ability to maintain, renew and extend solid relationships with our key partners. As part of our strategy, in addition to developing and marketing products based on properties we own or control, we also seek to obtain licenses enabling us to develop and market products based on popular entertainment properties owned by third parties.We currently have in-licenses to several successful entertainment properties, including MARVEL and STAR WARS, DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY FROZEN, BEYBLADE and DREAMWORKS’ TROLLS. Our agreements relating to MARVEL and STAR WARS were extended in February 2020. These licenses typically have multi-year terms and provide us with the right to market and sell designated classes of products. In recent years, our sales of products under the MARVEL, STAR WARS and BEYBLADE licenses have been highly significant to our business.  If we fail to meet our contractual commitments and/or any of these licenses were to terminate and not be maintained, renewed or extended, or the popularity of any of these licensed properties was to significantly decline, our business would be damaged and we would need to successfully develop and market other products to replace the products previously offered under license.Our license to the MARVEL property is granted from Marvel Entertainment, LLC and Marvel Characters B.V. (together “Marvel”). Our license to the STAR WARS property is granted by Lucas Licensing Ltd. and Lucasfilm Ltd. (together “Lucas”). Both Marvel and Lucas are owned by The Walt Disney Company.We may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties.The success of entertainment properties for which we have a license, such as MARVEL, STAR WARS, SESAME STREET, DISNEY PRINCESS, DISNEY FROZEN, DREAMWORKS’ TROLLS, YOKAI-WATCH or BEYBLADE, and the ability of us to successfully market and sell related products, can significantly affect our revenues and profitability. If we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series, the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering. In addition, competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure, maintain, and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms, if at all, and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design, develop and market successful products based on these properties.The license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial, and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales, which could result in write-offs of significant amounts which, in turn, would harm our results of operations. 21Table of ContentsAcquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable, which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal, or missing business opportunities for new licenses. Additionally, as a licensee of entertainment-based properties, we cannot guarantee that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy, game or other family entertainment products, and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us.We anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future, as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market. In the event that we are not able to acquire, maintain, renew or extend successful entertainment licenses on advantageous terms, our revenues and profits may be harmed.We have long‑term output licensing agreements for the acquisition of content and these agreements may not be renewed on favorable terms or at all.Through the acquisition of eOne in 2020, we have long‑term agreements to acquire and distribute content.  These agreements require us to pay for films released by the relevant studio at rates typically calculated by reference to the film’s budget (subject to maximum amounts payable per film and a cap on the maximum number of films that can be delivered to us each year).  In addition, we have entered into long term contracts for the acquisition of certain of our television programs.As these contracts expire, we may choose to renew, renegotiate or terminate them; equally, these arrangements are terminable by the counterparty under certain circumstances (including unremedied material breach).  If we are unable to renew or replace them on acceptable terms, we may not be able to replace this content with single film acquisitions.  Even if these contracts are renewed or replaced, the terms on which we acquire content may be less favorable than the terms of our current agreements and the financial success or quantity of films and television programs we acquire through these long‑term contracts may decrease.  There can also be no assurance that revenues based on these long‑term contracts will exceed the costs of acquiring the films or television programs.Our business is seasonal and therefore our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate. This seasonality is exacerbated by retailers’ quick response or just in time inventory management techniques.Sales of our toys, games and other family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from September through December in anticipation of the holiday season. This seasonality has increased over time, as retailers become more and more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response or just in time inventory management techniques, including the use of automated inventory replenishment programs. Further, ecommerce is growing significantly and accounting for a higher portion of the ultimate sales of our products to consumers. Ecommerce retailers tend to hold less inventory and take inventory closer to the time of sale to consumers than traditional retailers. As a result, customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers, such as us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. For toys, games and other family entertainment products which we produce, a majority of retail sales for the entire year generally occurs in the fourth quarter, close to the holiday season. As a consequence, the majority of our sales to our customers occurs in the period from September through December, as our customers do not want to maintain large on-hand inventories throughout the year ahead of consumer demand. While these techniques reduce a retailer’s investment in inventory, they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier. This can also result in our losing significant revenues and earnings if our supply chain is unable to supply product to our customers when they want it. Tariffs can exacerbate this negative impact by causing retailers to shift from direct import to domestic orders, further pressuring our supply chain as we experienced in 2019.The level of inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us. If we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional products to fully meet consumer demand. Additionally, the logistics of supplying more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance. This seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital, mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers. Our failure to accurately predict and 22Table of Contentsrespond to consumer demand, resulting in under producing popular items and/or overproducing less popular items, would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations.Our entertainment business is also subject to seasonal variations based on the timing of film cinema releases, physical home entertainment, and television and digital content releases.  Release dates are determined by several factors, including the timing of holiday periods, the U.S. release date of the film and competition in the market.As a result of the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year, by unforeseen events such as a natural disaster, a terrorist attack or economic shock that harms the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods, particularly from the Far East, during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season.The concentration of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us.We depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products. For example, for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Target Corporation and Amazon.com accounted for approximately 18%, 9% and 8%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 38% of our consolidated net revenues. In the U.S. and Canada segment, approximately 59% of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers. If one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing business with us, significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us, favor competitors or new entrants, increase their direct competition with us by expanding their private-label business, change their purchasing patterns, alter the manner in which they promote our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products, or return substantial amounts of our products, it could significantly harm our sales, profitability and financial condition.As an example of this, the bankruptcy filing by Toys“R”Us in the U.S. and Canada in September 2017, and in the United Kingdom in early 2018, and the subsequent liquidations of the Toys“R”Us business in many markets globally during 2018, as well as the inability of Toys“R”Us to pay certain outstanding receivables, significantly reduced our sales and profitability in the fourth quarter of 2017 and throughout 2018. The liquidation of millions of units of retail inventory held by Toys“R”Us into the market at closeout prices had a more substantial negative impact to sales of new products by us in 2018 than we, and industry experts, had initially expected in early 2018.Customers make no binding long-term commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders. Any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products. In addition, increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers. Furthermore, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our other significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and profitability.Our use of third-party manufacturers to produce our products, as well as certain other products, presents risks to our business.All of our products are manufactured by third-party manufacturers, the majority of which are located in China. Should changes be necessary, our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted, over a significant period of time, to alternative sources of supply. If we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political, civil, labor or other factors beyond our control, including natural disasters, adverse health conditions or pandemics, our operations may be substantially disrupted, potentially for a significant period of time. This delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business while alternative sources of supply are secured.Given that our toy manufacturing is conducted by third-party manufacturers, the majority of whom are located in China, health conditions, such as the coronavirus, and other factors affecting social and economic activity in China and affecting the movement of people and products into and from China to our major markets, including North America and Europe, as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in China, could have a significant negative impact on our operations, revenues and earnings.23Table of ContentsFactors that could negatively affect our business include a potential significant revaluation of the Chinese Yuan, which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products in China, labor shortages and increases in labor costs in China as well as difficulties in moving products manufactured in China out of Asia and through the ports in North America and Europe, whether due to port congestion, labor disputes, slow-downs, product regulations and/or inspections or other factors. Prolonged disputes or slowdowns at west coast ports can negatively impact both the time and cost of transporting goods into the U.S. Natural disasters or health pandemics impacting China can also have a significant negative impact on our business.Further, the imposition of tariffs, border adjustment taxes, trade sanctions or other regulations or economic penalties by the U.S. or the European Union against products imported by us from China or other foreign countries, or the loss of “normal trade relations” status with China or other foreign countries in which we operate, could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the U.S. or Europe, shift more orders to domestic sales, put additional shipping and warehousing burdens on us, delay the time of our sales to retailers, result in some lost sales, and otherwise harm our business. Additionally, the suspension of the operations of a third-party manufacturer by government inspectors in China or another market in which we source products could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales.We have been working over the last several years to reduce our reliance on manufacturing in China, such as by moving production of certain products to facilities in other countries like India, Vietnam and Mexico, as well as by increasing production of our products in other markets, including in the U.S. We plan to continue those efforts in future years, but cannot guarantee we will be as successful in these efforts as we plan. Furthermore, many of these newer production facilities, such as in India and Vietnam, raise other risks in that we are working with vendors who have not been manufacturing products like ours for as long as historical vendors in China. That means these new vendors must successfully develop the capability to manufacture our products to the quality and safety standards we require and within the tight timeframe required by our customers.We require our third-party manufacturers to comply with our Global Business Ethics Principles, which are designed to prevent products manufactured for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions. Our Global Business Ethics Principles address a number of issues, including working hours and compensation, health and safety, and abuse and discrimination. In addition, we require that our products supplied by third-party manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including consumer and product safety laws in the markets where those products are sold. Hasbro has the right and exercises such right, both directly and through the use of outside monitors, to monitor compliance by our third-party manufacturers with our Global Business Ethics Principles and other manufacturing requirements. In addition, we do quality assurance testing on our products, including products manufactured for us by third parties. Notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them, there is always a risk that one or more of our third-party manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such non-compliance. Any failure of our third-party manufacturers to comply with labor, consumer, product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation, harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us.Our success is critically dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees.Our officers and employees are at the heart of all of our efforts. It is their skill, innovation and hard work that drive our success. We compete with many other potential employers in recruiting, hiring and retaining our senior management team and our many other skilled officers and employees around the world.  In the entertainment industry, experienced personnel and top creative talent are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense.  The impact of failing to retain key employees can be high due to loss of key knowledge and relationships, loss of creative talent, lost productivity, hiring and training costs, all of which could result in lower profitability.  We cannot guarantee that we will be able to recruit, hire or retain the senior management, officers and employees we need to succeed.Recently we have experienced significant changes in our workforce due to our acquisition of eOne, as well as our restructuring efforts and the recruitment and hiring of new skill sets required for our changing global business.   The changes in our employee composition, both in terms of global distribution and in skill sets, have required changes in our business. Our loss of key management or other employees, or our inability to hire talented people with the skill sets we need for our changing business, could significantly harm our business.24Table of ContentsTo remain competitive we must continuously develop new skills and work to increase efficiency and reduce costs, but we cannot guarantee we will be successful in this regard.Our business is extremely competitive, the pace of change in our industry is getting faster and our competitors are always working to be more efficient and profitable. To compete, we must continuously improve our processes, increase efficiency and work to reduce our expenses. We intend to achieve this partly by focusing on a select number of global brand initiatives and through process improvements, including in global product development. However, we cannot guarantee we will achieve our cost savings and efficiency enhancing goals and we may realize fewer benefits than are expected from these initiatives.In response to the continuing evolution of the global consumer landscape, shopping behaviors and the retail environment, in recent years, we have taken certain actions as part of our ongoing efforts to transform and reimagine our business, to strengthen our connections with audiences and consumers, and enhance our ability to continue bringing meaningful brand experiences to life. These actions included a commercial reorganization as well as adding new capabilities based on our understanding of changing consumer behaviors and how our retailers are going to market, while also changing many of the ways we organize across our brand blueprint. The actions also included headcount reductions aimed at right-sizing our cost-structure. We cannot guarantee that our restructuring actions will deliver the cost-reductions we estimate or that our ongoing efforts to evolve our business will be as successful as we plan.Our business is critically dependent on our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully.Our intellectual property, including our trademarks and tradenames, copyrights, patents, and rights under our license agreements and other agreements that establish our intellectual property rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, is of critical value. We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands in the U.S. and around the world. From time to time, third parties have challenged, and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our intellectual property in the U.S. and around the world. In addition, our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights, including the possibility of unauthorized third parties copying and distributing our productions or certain portions or applications of our intended productions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. Similarly, third parties may claim ownership over certain aspects of our products, productions or other intellectual property. Our failure to successfully protect our intellectual property rights could significantly harm our business and competitive position.We have a material amount of acquired product rights which, if impaired, would result in a reduction of our net earnings.Much of our intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our consolidated balance sheets. Declines in the profitability of acquired brands or licensed products or our decision to reduce our focus or exit these brands may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge. Reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results.We may incur impairments and write‑offs if the films and television programs we acquire and produce do not perform well enough to recoup our acquisition, production, marketing and distribution costs.We incur significant costs to acquire, produce and distribute content.  Most agreements to acquire content for distribution require minimum guarantees against royalties.  The minimum guarantees are derived from our estimate of net revenues that will be realized from our distribution of the title in the relevant markets, and actual results may differ from those estimates.  If sales do not meet our original estimates, we may:  (i) not recognize the expected gross margin or net profit; (ii) not recoup our minimum guarantees or distribution expenses; (iii) record accelerated amortization and/or fair value write‑downs of minimum guarantees paid; or (iv) not recoup the additional funds and expenses invested to market films that we have produced or acquired.With respect to content we produce, we are required to amortize capitalized production costs based on estimated ultimate revenue as we recognize revenues from the associated films or television productions.  Unamortized production costs are evaluated for impairment each reporting period on a project‑by‑project basis.  If estimated remaining revenue is not sufficient to recover the unamortized production costs, the unamortized production costs will be written down to fair value.  In any given quarter, if we lower our previous forecast with respect to total anticipated revenue from any individual film or other project, we may be required to accelerate 25Table of Contentsamortization or record impairment charges with respect to the unamortized costs, even if we have previously recorded impairment charges for such film or other project.  Such impairment and accelerated amortization charges and write‑offs could harm our financial results.Similarly, our business could be harmed by greater-than-expected costs, or unexpected delays or difficulties, associated with our investment in Discovery Family Channel, such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or in building advertising revenues for Discovery Family Channel. If the Discovery Family Channel is not successful our investments may become impaired, which could result in a write-down through net earnings.We incurred significant indebtedness in connection with our acquisition of eOne. As a result it may be more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debt or take other actions, and we may need to divert cash to fund debt service payments.We incurred significant indebtedness to finance our acquisition of eOne. The increase in our debt service obligations resulting from additional indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition and prospects of the combined company.In particular, our increased indebtedness could:•make it more difficult and/or costly for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due, particularly during adverse economic and industry conditions, because a decrease in revenues or increase in costs could cause cash flow from operations to be insufficient to make scheduled debt service payments;•require a substantial portion of our available cash to be used for debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of our cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, acquisitions or other strategic opportunities, dividend payments, share repurchases and other general corporate purposes, which could harm our prospects for growth and the market price of the notes and other debt securities, among other things;•result in downgrades in the credit ratings on our indebtedness, which could limit our ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms or at all (including in order to refinance our other debt), increase the interest rates under our credit facilities (including the Hasbro term loan facility) and under any new indebtedness we may incur, and reduce the trading prices of our outstanding debt securities and common stock;•make it more difficult for us to raise capital to fund working capital, make capital expenditures, pay dividends, pursue strategic initiatives or for other purposes;•result in higher interest expense, which could be further increased in case of current or future borrowings subject to variable rates of interest;•require that materially adverse terms, conditions or covenants be placed on us under our debt instruments, which could include, for example, limitations on additional borrowings or limitations on our ability to create liens, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock or make investments, any of which could hinder our access to capital markets or our flexibility in the conduct of our business and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse competitive industry conditions; and•jeopardize our ability to pay our indebtedness if we were to experience a severe downturn in our business.We have relied on external financing, including our credit facility, to help fund our operations. If we were unable to obtain or service such financing, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome, our business would be harmed.Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our working capital needs, particularly those in the third and fourth quarters, we may rely on our commercial paper program, revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital. We currently have a commercial paper program which, subject to market conditions, and availability under our committed revolving credit facility, allows us to issue up to $1,000.0 million in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a source of working capital funding and liquidity. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms, or at all, at any given point in time.We also have a revolving credit agreement which provides for a $1,500.0 million committed revolving credit facility, effective upon completion of the acquisition of eOne on December 30, 2019. This facility is a further source of working capital funding and liquidity and supports borrowings under our commercial paper program. The credit 26Table of Contentsagreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility. These restrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial, operating and strategic flexibility. Non-compliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines, a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations.Not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing, but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing. In times of severe economic downturn and/or distress in the credit markets, it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us. In such a situation, it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities, and it might not be possible to find alternative sources of funding.We also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to time, through the issuance of debt securities. Our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interest rates, and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities. The failure to receive financing on desirable terms, or at all, could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities.If we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance our outstanding debt or face default. We cannot guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms, or at all.The production of films and television programs require a substantial investment of capital and utilizes production financing to invest in productions.With the acquisition of eOne we expect to continue to use production financing to finance certain of our productions, which eOne has historically been able to obtain on commercially reasonable terms.  In the event that we are unable to provide eOne with appropriate financing or if third party production financing becomes unavailable, for example, if finance providers become unwilling or unable (due to creditors’ own constraints and ability to lend) to provide production financing on reasonable commercial terms or at all, we may not have sufficient alternative funding sources available to finance a particular production.  In this case, we may not be able to produce the films and television programs we aim to do as part of our business plan and strategy which could harm our business.Following our acquisition of eOne, the distribution of Canadian certified content is an important part of our business, and we benefit from funding from the Canadian government.eOne's Canadian business utilizes certain government incentive programs and tax credits in Canada to finance a portion of its production budgets. If these incentive programs or tax credits were to be reduced, amended or eliminated, or if eOne no longer qualified for these programs or tax credits, our and eOne’s business, financial condition, operating results or prospects could be materially and adversely affected.The loss of Canadian status of Entertainment One Canada Ltd. could result in the loss of licenses, incentives and tax credits.Through our acquisition of eOne, we indirectly acquired all of the non-voting equity shares and preferred shares in Entertainment One Canada Ltd. (“EOCL”) and (b) 25% of the voting shares in EOCL. The remaining 75% of the voting shares in EOCL are held by independent shareholders, who are not controlled by us. EOCL is able to benefit from a number of licenses, incentive programs and Canadian government tax credits as a result of it being “Canadian” as defined in the Investment Canada Act.  As part of our acquisition of eOne, we have taken measures to ensure that EOCL’s Canadian status is maintained.  There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to maintain EOCL's Canadian status. The loss of EOCL’s Canadian status could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects, including the possible loss of future incentive programs and clawback of funding previously provided to EOCL.27Table of ContentsAs a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation, we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future, violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business. In addition, we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls, which could harm our business.As a manufacturer of consumer products, we are subject to significant government regulations, including, in the U.S., under The Consumer Products Safety Act, The Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and The Flammable Fabrics Act, as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets. In addition, certain of our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration or similar international authorities. In addition, advertising to children is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and a host of other agencies globally, and the collection of information from children under the age of 13 is subject to the provisions of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and other privacy laws around the world. The collection of personally identifiable information from anyone, including adults, is under increasing regulation in many markets, and in May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation became effective in the European Union. While we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts and regulations, we cannot assure you that we will be in compliance and failure to comply with these requirements could result in fines, liabilities or sanctions which could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall. While costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business, the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant. In addition, any product recall, regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations.Governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations. In addition, one or more of our customers might require changes in our products, such as the non-use of certain materials, in the future. Complying with any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business. Similarly, increased penalties for non-compliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations. Such increased costs or penalties could harm our business.As a large, multinational corporation, we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world, including antitrust, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, environmental regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition.Our business also involves risks of liability claims for media content, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.As a distributor and producer of media content, we may face potential liability for defamation, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials distributed.  These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against producers and distributors of media content.  Any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects.Our entertainment business could be adversely affected by strikes or other union job actions.Our entertainment business is directly or indirectly dependent upon highly specialized union members who are essential to the production of films and television programs.  A strike by, or a lockout of, one or more of the unions that provide personnel essential to the production of films or television programs could delay or halt our ongoing production activities.  Such a halt or delay, depending on the length of time, could cause a delay or interruption in our release of new films and television programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures, or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization.Acquisitions and investments have been a component of our growth and the development of our business, and that is likely to continue in the future. Acquisitions can broaden and diversify our brand holdings and product 28Table of Contentsofferings, and allow us to build additional capabilities and competencies around our brand blueprint. In reviewing potential acquisitions or investments, we target brands, assets or companies that we believe offer attractive entertainment products or offerings, the ability for us to leverage our entertainment offerings, opportunities to drive our strategic brand blueprint and associated competencies, or other synergies.We cannot be certain that the products and offerings of companies we may acquire, or acquire an interest in, will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products, develop our competencies or to grow our business. In some cases, we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production, marketing and other operating, revenue or cost synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and, where applicable, cost savings, operating efficiencies and other advantages. However, we cannot be certain that these synergies, efficiencies and cost savings will be realized. Even if achieved, these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization. In other cases, we may acquire or invest in companies that we believe have strong and creative management, in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations. We cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products, entertainment or services in the future. We cannot guarantee that any acquisition or investment we may make will be successful or beneficial, and acquisitions can consume significant amounts of management attention and other resources, which may negatively impact other aspects of our business. For additional risks relating to our acquisition of eOne, see “Risks Related to Our Business Following the Acquisition of eOne.”Failure to successfully operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability.We rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications to manage many aspects of our business, including product development, management of our supply chain, sale and delivery of our products, financial reporting and various other processes and transactions. We are critically dependent on the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems and related back-up systems. These systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, malware and other security breaches, catastrophic events such as hurricanes, fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees or partners. The efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems, including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully. The failure of our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business, require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability.If our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed.We and our business partners maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world. This data relates to all aspects of our business, including current and future products and entertainment under development, and also contains certain customer, consumer, supplier, partner and employee data. We maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data, but notwithstanding such protective measures, there is a risk of intrusion, cyber-attacks or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data. In addition, we provide confidential and proprietary information to our third-party business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business. While we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data, and where applicable, that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties, nonetheless those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of such data. Any compromise of the confidential data of our customers, consumers, suppliers, partners, employees or ourselves, or failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of or damage to this data through breach of our information technology systems or other means could substantially disrupt our operations, harm our customers, consumers, employees and other business partners, damage our reputation, violate applicable laws and regulations, subject us to potentially significant costs and liabilities and result in a loss of business that could be material.From time to time, we are involved in litigation, arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense.As a large multinational corporation, we are subject, from time to time, to regulatory investigations, litigation and arbitration disputes, including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of products that have been or may be developed by us as well as claims by third parties that our products infringe 29Table of Contentsupon or misuse such third parties’ property or rights. Because the outcome of litigation, arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant cost for us and harm our business. The fact that we operate in a significant number of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements. Any successful claim against us could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in, or differing interpretations of, income tax laws and rules, and changes in our geographic operating results, may impact our effective tax rate.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in various international tax jurisdictions. We also conduct business activities between our operating units in various jurisdictions and we are subject to transfer pricing rules in the countries in which we operate. There is some degree of uncertainty and subjectivity in complying with transfer pricing rules. Our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in, or the interpretation of, tax laws or by changes in the amount of revenue and earnings we derive, or are determined to derive by tax authorities, from jurisdictions with differing tax rates.In addition, we may be subject to tax examinations by federal, state, and international jurisdictions, and these examinations can result in significant tax findings if the tax authorities interpret the application of laws and rules differently than we do or disagree with the intercompany rates we are applying. We assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from tax uncertainties. While we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome of these uncertain tax benefits, or results of possible current or future tax examinations, may differ from our estimates and may have a significant adverse impact on our business and operating results.We have a material amount of goodwill which, if it becomes impaired, would result in a reduction in our net earnings.Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire. Goodwill is not amortized and is required to be evaluated for impairment at least annually. Declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in a write-down of our goodwill and consequently harm our results of operations. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company took a number of actions to react to a rapidly changing mobile gaming industry that resulted in changes to the long-term projections for the Backflip business which led the Company to conclude the goodwill associated with the Backflip reporting unit was impaired which led to an impairment charge for the year ended December 30, 2018.Risks Related to Our Business Following the Consummation of the Acquisition of eOneWe may not realize the anticipated financial benefits of the acquisition of eOne.While we expect the acquisition of eOne to result in significant synergies and to be accretive to earnings per share (on an adjusted earnings basis that is not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”), this expectation is based on estimates and assumptions about, among other things, our and eOne’s business, the amount of revenues and savings that can be generated from moving a significant portion of eOne’s family brand licensing business in-house, our ability to enhance the profitability of eOne’s licensing and merchandising activities, the ability of the combined company to employ its enhanced capabilities in television, film and music to grow the overall business and successfully develop and drive branded entertainment, including entertainment based on our brands, and the ability of the combined company to successfully ideate and develop future intellectual property and brand extensions. These estimates and assumptions may be inaccurate and may change materially over time, reducing or eliminating the anticipated financial benefits of the acquisition. Further, this expectation is also based on the assumption that we are able to successfully integrate eOne’s business and operations with our business and operations and that we are able to effectively manage our expanded operations following the acquisition.We may be unable to successfully integrate our and eOne’s businesses in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition within the intended timeframe or at all, and our acquisition of eOne will expose us to risks related to eOne’s business.If we are unable to successfully integrate eOne’s business and operations with our business and operations, we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition in the timeframe that we expect or at all. Any integration issues we face could also have an adverse effect on the combined company for an undetermined period after completion of the acquisition, including by adversely affecting our relationships with customers, consumers, suppliers, employees or other constituencies, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. 30Table of ContentsDifficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process or otherwise after the consummation of the acquisition include the following:•the ability to successfully apply capabilities and expertise in certain areas of the business to other areas of the combined business;•integration of management teams into a cohesive combined company;•differences in business backgrounds and models, corporate cultures and management philosophies; •the ability to continue to attract and retain key management and personnel;•the ability to create and implement a unified strategy, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;•the challenge of integrating complex systems, technology, networks and other assets of eOne into those of ours in a manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, consumers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies;•potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the acquisition, including costs to integrate eOne; and•the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, our ongoing businesses, including the diversion of management’s attention away from ongoing business and towards integration matters.In addition, we will also assume risks unique to the nature of eOne’s business. These risks are described above under “-Risks Related to Our Business”.Our results after the consummation of the acquisition may suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations. Following the consummation of the acquisition, the size and complexity of our business has increased beyond the current size of our or eOne’s existing business. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to successfully manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of a significantly larger brand portfolio and complex organization across many global jurisdictions, additional revenue growth and expanded franchise economics expected as a result of the acquisition. We cannot assure you that we will be successful after completion of the acquisition or that we will realize the expected benefits currently anticipated from the acquisition.  The consummation of the acquisition may expose us to unknown liabilities. Because we have acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of eOne, we have assumed responsibility for all of its liabilities. If there are unknown liabilities or other obligations, including contingent liabilities, our business could be materially affected. As a distributor and producer of media content, eOne faces potential liability for causes of action such as defamation, invasion of privacy or other claims based on the nature and content of the materials distributed. We may also learn additional information regarding eOne that adversely affects us, such as issues that could affect our ability to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or issues that could affect our ability to comply with other applicable laws. The combined company will record goodwill and other intangible assets that could become impaired and result in material non-cash charges to the results of operations of the combined company in the future. The acquisition is being accounted for as an acquisition by Hasbro in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Under the acquisition method of accounting, goodwill as of the acquisition date will be measured as the excess amount of consideration transferred, which is generally measured at a fair value, net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which are also measured at their fair value. Goodwill must be assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows. Declines in operating results, divestitures, markets and other factors that may impact the fair value of a reporting unit could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, and, in turn, a charge to net income. Such a charge would have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition"

If we are not successful in developing and expanding these critical brands our business will suffer.  We have made astrategic decision to focus on fewer, larger global brands as we build our business. We are moving away from SKU making behaviors, which involve developing a large number of different products across many brands, towards global brand buildingwith an emphasis on developing our franchise and key partner brands, which we view as having the largest global potential. As we concentrate our efforts on a more select group of brands we can gain additional leverage and enhance the consumerexperience. But this focus also means that our future success depends disproportionately on our and our partners ability to successfully develop this select group of brands across the brand blueprint and to maintain and extend the reach andrelevance of these brands to global consumers in a wide array of markets. This strategy has required us to build and develop competencies in new areas, including storytelling, digital content and consumer products. Developing and growing thesecompetencies has required significant effort, time and money.  In 2018, revenues from our seven franchise brands, BABY ALIVE, MAGIC: THEGATHERING, MONOPOLY, NERF, MY LITTLE PONY, PLAY-DOH and TRANSFORMERS, totaled 53% of our aggregate net revenues. Revenues from our key partner brands, including BEYBLADE, DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEYFROZEN, MARVEL, STAR WARS, DREAMWORKS TROLLS, and YO-KAI WATCH, constituted 22% of our aggregate net revenues in 2018. Together our franchise and partner brands account for the substantial majority ofour revenues. If we are unable to successfully maintain and develop our franchise and key partner brands in the future, continue to drive their relevance to consumers and grow sales of products and storytelling experiences based on those brands, ourrevenues and profits will decline and our business performance will suffer. In addition to continuing to grow and develop our existing franchise brands, successfully executing our brand strategy requires us to successfully develop other brands, suchas current emerging brands, and elevate them to franchise brand status over time. There is no guarantee that we will be able to do this successfully. As an example of this process, in February 2018 we elevated BABY ALIVE to franchise brand statusand moved LITTLEST PET SHOP, which we are in the process of reinventing and which requires a different developmental approach at this point, out of Franchise Brands and into Emerging Brands. Consumer interests change rapidly, making it difficult to create storytelling experiences and to design and developproducts which will be popular with children and families, or to maintain the popularity of successful products and brands.  Theinterests of children and families evolve extremely quickly and can change dramatically from year to year. To be successful we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment content, products and play patterns which will capturechildrens and families interests and imagination and quickly develop and introduce innovative products which can compete successfully for consumers limited time, attention and spending. This challenge is more difficult withthe ever-increasing utilization of technology and digital media in entertainment offerings, and the increasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers. Evolving consumer tastes and shifting interests, coupled with an ever changing andexpanding pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for childrens and families interest and acceptance, create an environment in which some products can fail to achieve consumer acceptance, and otherproducts can be popular during a certain period of time but then be rapidly replaced. As a result, individual childrens and family entertainment products and properties often have short consumer life cycles. If we devote time andresources to developing and marketing entertainment and products that consumers do not find interesting enough to buy in sufficient quantities to be profitable to us, our revenues and profits may decline and our business performance may be damaged.Similarly, if our product offerings and entertainment fail to correctly anticipate consumer interests our revenues and earnings will be reduced.  Additionally, our business is increasingly global and depends on interest in and acceptance of our childrens and family entertainment products and properties by consumers in diverse markets around the worldwith different tastes and preferences. As such, our success depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences in multiple markets and geographies and to design product and entertainmentofferings that can achieve popularity globally over a broad and diverse consumer audience. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop and market products with global appeal.   13 Table of ContentsThe challenge of continuously developing and offering products andstorytelling experiences that are sought after by children is compounded by the sophistication of todays children and the increasing array of technology and entertainment offerings available to them. Children are increasingly utilizing electronic offerings such as tablet devices and mobile phones and they are expanding their interests to a widerarray of innovative, technology-driven entertainment products and digital and social media offerings at younger and younger ages. Our products compete with the offerings of consumer electronics companies, digital media and social mediacompanies. To meet this challenge we, and our competitors, are designing and marketing products which incorporate increasing technology, seek to integrate digital and analog play, and aim to capitalize on new play patterns and increasedconsumption of digital and social media.  With the increasing array of competitive entertainment offerings, there is no guarantee that:     Any of our brands, products or product lines will achieve popularity or continue to be popular;     Any property for which we have a significant license will achieve or sustain popularity;     Any new products or product lines we introduce will be considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate market acceptance; or     Any products life cycle or sales quantities will be sufficient to permit us to profitably recover our development, manufacturing, marketing, royalties(including royalty advances and guarantees) and other costs of producing, marketing and selling the product.  Engaging storytelling across media is an increasingly important factor for driving brand awareness and successfully building brands. Entertainment media, in forms such as television, motion pictures, digital content and other media, have become increasingly important platforms forconsumers to experience our brands and our partners brands and the success, or lack of success, of such media efforts can significantly impact the demand for our products and our financial performance. We spend considerable resources indesigning and developing products in conjunction with planned media releases, both by our partners and our own media releases. Not only our efforts, but the efforts of third parties, such as licensors and motion picture studios with whom we work,heavily impact the amount, content and timing of media development, release dates and the ultimate consumer interest in and success of these media efforts.  In 2018, we developed and marketed significant product lines tied to the motion picture releases by key partners of BLACK PANTHER, AVENGERS: INFINITY WARS and SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY. In addition, we developedand marketed products related to BUMBLEBEE, a motion picture developed and released by us working with our partner Paramount Pictures. For 2019, we are developing and marketing significant product lines tied to the scheduled motion picture releasesby key partners of a number of properties, including DISNEYS ALADDIN, DISNEYS FROZEN II and STAR WARS: EPISODE IX. Those motion pictures are all being developed and released by our partners and our partners control the content andschedule for such motion pictures. Other key partner product lines we are offering, such as BEYBLADE and YOKAI-WATCH, depend on television support by our partners for their successes. Similarly, we are developing and marketing products forentertainment we play a more active role in developing or develop ourselves, such as TRANSFORMERS and MY LITTLE PONY. If those motion pictures, television shows, or any other key entertainment content for which we develop and market products are notas successful as we and our partners anticipate, our revenues and earnings will fall.  The ultimate timing and success of such projectsis critically dependent on the efforts and schedules of our licensors, and studio and media partners. We do not fully control when or if any particular motion picture projects will be greenlit, developed or released, and our licensors or mediapartners may change their plans with respect to projects and release dates or cancel development all together. This can make it difficult for us to get feature films developed, plan future entertainment slates and to successfully develop andmarket products in conjunction with future motion picture and other media releases, given the lengthy lead times involved in product development and successful marketing efforts, and the fact that third party partners of ours may decide not todevelop such entertainment.  When we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases, those statements are basedon our current plans and expectations. Unforeseen factors may increase the cost of these releases, delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation. Any delay or cancellation of planned product development work, introductions, or mediasupport may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business.   14 Table of ContentsLack of sufficient consumer interest in entertainment media we orour partners produce or for which we offer products can harm our business.  Motion pictures, television, digital content or othermedia we produce or for which we develop products may not be as popular with consumers as we anticipated. While it is difficult to anticipate what products may be sought after by consumers, it can be even more difficult to properly predict thepopularity of media efforts and properties given the broad array of competing offerings. If our or our partners media efforts, and related product offerings, fail to garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance, our revenues and thefinancial return from such efforts will be harmed.  Under the relationship we entered with Paramount in October 2017 we plan to play amore significant role in the production and financing of motion pictures based on our properties. That has the advantage of giving us more input to what and when properties are developed into motion pictures, and can allow us to earn a greaterreturn from successful films, but it also increases the money we will directly spend on film production and puts that investment at risk. If our motion pictures are not as successful as we anticipate they will be, or if we are not able to produceand distribute films according to the schedule we have planned, due to creative or other difficulties or delays, our financial performance will be negatively impacted.  Discovery Family Channel, our cable television joint venture with Discovery Communications, Inc. in the United States, competes with a number of other childrens television networks for viewers, advertisingrevenue and distribution fees. There is no guarantee that Discovery Family Channel will be successful. Similarly, our programming distributed both domestically and internationally, Allspark Animations and Allspark Pictures releases andBackflip Studios digital products compete with content from many other parties. Lack of consumer interest in and acceptance of content developed by Hasbro Studios, Allspark Animation, Allspark Pictures and Backflip Studios, or other contentappearing on Discovery Family Channel, and products related to that content, could significantly harm our business. Similarly, our business could be harmed by greater than expected costs, or unexpected delays or difficulties, associated with ourinvestment in Discovery Family Channel, such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or in building advertising revenues for Discovery Family Channel. During 2018 we spent $132.0 million for television programming and filmprojects we are developing and we anticipate that we will spend approximately $65.0 million to $85.0 million in 2019, and anticipate comparable or higher levels in future years. At December 30, 2018, $236.9 million, or 4.5%, of our total assets, represented our investments in the Discovery Family Channel. If theDiscovery Family Channel is not successful our investments may become impaired, which could result in a write-down through net earnings.  The childrens and family entertainment industry and consumer products industry are highly competitive and the barriers to entry are low. If we are unable to competeeffectively with existing or new competitors or with our retailers private label toy products our revenues, market share and profitability could decline.  The childrens and family entertainment industry and the consumer products industry are, and will continue to be, highly competitive. We compete in the United States and internationally with a wide arrayof large and small manufacturers, marketers, and sellers of analog toys and games, digital gaming products, digital media, products which combine analog and digital play, and other entertainment and consumer products, as well as with retailers whooffer such products under their own private labels. In addition, we compete with other companies who are focused on building their brands across multiple product and consumer categories. Across our business, we face competitors who areconstantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends, seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase. In 2018, for example, ourNERF branded products faced significantly increased competition from both newer entrants into the blaster space, as well as private label offerings from major retailers. A number of these competitors sought to gain market share by offering productswith less innovation than our products at price points below our products, particularly by offering blasters in the under $20 retail price range.  In addition to existing competitors, the barriers to entry for new participants in the childrens and family entertainment industry and in the consumer products industry are low, and the increasing importanceof digital media, and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest, has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets, and has broadened the array of companies we compete with. New participants witha popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time. These existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly thanus to changes in consumer preferences. Our competitors products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products, lower our revenues and lower our profitability.   15 Table of ContentsIn recent years, retailers have also developed their own private-label products that directlycompete with the products of traditional manufacturers and brand owners. Some retail chains that are our customers sell private-label childrens and family entertainment products designed, manufactured and branded by the retailersthemselves. These products may be sold at prices lower than our prices for comparable products, which may result in lower purchases of our products by these retailers and may reduce our market share. An inability to develop and introduce planned products, product lines and new brands in a timely and cost-effectivemanner may damage our business.  In developing products, product lines and new brands we have anticipated dates for theassociated product and brand introductions. When we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a particular product, product line or brand at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associateddevelopment, implementation, and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule. There is no guarantee that we will be able to manufacture, source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on acost-effective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands. This risk is heightened by our customers compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business. Further, ecommerce is growing significantly and accountingfor a higher portion of the ultimate sales of our products to consumers. Ecommerce retailers tend to hold less inventory and take inventory closer to the time of sale to consumers than traditional retailers. The risk is also exacerbated by theincreasing sophistication of many of the products we are designing, and brands we are developing in terms of combining digital and analog technologies, utilizing digital media to a greater degree, and providing greater innovation and productdifferentiation. Unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process, significant increases in the planned cost of development, or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction datefor products to be later than anticipated, may reduce or eliminate the profitability of such products or, in some situations, may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued. Our success depends on our ongoing ability to successfully evolve our capabilities and business to meet the challengesof a changing retail landscape and to successfully develop new aspects of our business  2018 was a year of significant retaildisruption in our industry. Our future success depends on our ability to continue evolving and transforming our business to address a changing global consumer landscape and retail environment, one in which online shopping accounts for an increasingpercentage of total sales to consumers, digital first marketing is critical to garner and develop consumer interest, ecommerce focused companies like Amazon.com, Inc. are now among our largest customers, traditional brick and mortar retailers facechallenges to their businesses from the disintermediation caused by the expanding prevalence of online shopping, and the presence of specialty toy retailers has been significantly reduced in many of our markets due to bankruptcies, such as that ofToys R Us, potentially reducing, at least in the shorter term, physical shelf space available to offer family entertainment properties. These market conditions require that we drive a digital-first orientation throughout our Company,adapt the way we produce and distribute our products to meet the needs of ecommerce retailers, and continue developing alternate retail channels to reach our consumers and recapture shelf space lost by specialty retailers. In addition to successfully driving our business in a changing retail landscape, our future success depends on developing new areas of our business.A prime example of that is our initiative to drive our MAGIC: THE GATHERING brand through digital gaming and esports. We have invested considerable time and resources in our MAGIC: THE GATHERING Arena online game, which is currently in open beta,and our MAGIC: THE GATHERING esports initiative. Those initiatives require different skills, investments and business strategies than more traditional areas of our business and our ability to successfully and profitably develop and deploy thoseskills and strategies, and drive those businesses, will be a major factor in achieving future success for our Company. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance. Our global operations mean we produce and buy products, and sell products, in many different jurisdictions with many differentcurrencies. As a result, if the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes, our financial results as reported in U.S. dollars, may bemeaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected. As an example, if the dollar appreciates 10% relative to a local currency for an international market in which we had $200 million of net revenues,the dollar value of those sales, as they are translated into U.S. dollars, would decrease by $20 million in our consolidated financial results. As such, we would recognize a $20 million decrease in our net revenues, even if the actuallevel of sales in the foreign market had not changed. Similarly, our expenses can be   16 Table of Contentssignificantly impacted, in U.S. dollar terms, by exchange rates, meaning the profitability of our business in U.S. dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movementswhich we do not control. During 2018, certain key currencies, such as the Euro, Russian Ruble, and Brazilian Real depreciated significantly against the U.S. dollar. This depreciation had a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings.Depreciation in key currencies during 2018 and beyond may have a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings as they are reported in U.S. dollars.  Global and regional economic downturns that negatively impact the retail and credit markets, or that otherwise damage the financial health of our retail customers and consumers, orother factors negatively impacting retail sales, can harm our business and financial performance.  We design, manufacture andmarket a wide variety of entertainment and consumer products worldwide through sales to our retail customers and directly to consumers. Our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending in the markets inwhich we operate. Recessions, credit crises and other economic downturns, or disruptions in credit markets, in the United States and in other markets in which our products are marketed and sold can result in lower levels of economic activity,lower employment levels, less consumer disposable income, and lower consumer confidence. Similarly, reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers, such as their homes or stock market investments, can lower consumer confidence and consumerspending power. Any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products. This in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability. In addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our products during times of economic difficulty, in an effort to maintain sales duringsuch times we may need to reduce the price of our products, increase our promotional spending and/or sales allowances, or take other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products. Those steps may lower our net revenues orincrease our costs, thereby decreasing our operating margins and lowering our profitability. These challenges can be exacerbated if our customers accumulate excess retail inventories over time due to their purchases of our products exceeding salesof those products to ultimate consumers. It can then take us significant time, working with our retailers, to reduce those excess retail inventories, and in the interim our sales of new products can be negatively impacted. Our business in Europe in2018 was significantly reduced by excess retail inventories that we needed to address during the year.  Our revenues and profitabilityfor 2018 were negatively impacted by the ongoing economic challenges and resulting lower sales of our products in the United Kingdom and in Brazil. The economic downturn in the United Kingdom is partly caused by uncertainly around Brexit. If thesemarkets, or other significant markets, experience economic difficulties in 2019 it can harm our business and financial results.  An increasing portion of our business is expected to come from emerging markets, and growing business in emerging markets presents additional challenges. We expect an increasing portion of our net revenues to come from emerging markets in the future, including Eastern Europe, Latin America, Africa andAsia. In 2018 revenues in emerging markets constituted approximately 14% of our net revenues, up from only 6% of our net revenues in 2010. Over time, we expect our emerging market net revenues to continue to grow both in absolute terms and as apercentage of our overall business as one of our key business strategies is to increase our presence in emerging and underserved international markets. Operating in an increasing number of markets, each with its own unique consumer preferencesand business climates, presents additional challenges that we must meet. In addition to the need to successfully anticipate and serve different global consumer preferences and interests, sales and operations in emerging markets that we haveentered, may enter, or may increase our presence in, are subject to other risks associated with international operations, including:      Complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies and the evolution of laws andregulations that impact our product offerings and related enforcement;      Potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross border transactions;     Difficulties understanding the retail climate, consumer trends, local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be quite different from theUnited States;      Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another, including port congestion, strikes and other transportation delays and interruptions;and      The imposition of tariffs, border adjustment taxes, quotas, or other protectionist measures.   17 Table of ContentsBecause of the importance of our emerging market net revenues, our financial condition andresults of operations could be harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our emerging market business.  Our business depends in large part on the success of our key partner brands and on our ability to maintain and extend solid relationships with our key partners. As part of our strategy, in addition to developing and marketing products based on properties we own or control, we also seek to obtain licensesenabling us to develop and market products based on popular entertainment properties owned by third parties.  We currently have in-licenses to several successful entertainment properties, including MARVEL and STAR WARS, DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY FROZEN, BEYBLADE and DREAMWORKS TROLLS. These licenses typically have multi-yearterms and provide us with the right to market and sell designated classes of products. In recent years our sales of products under the MARVEL, STAR WARS and BEYBLADE licenses have been highly significant to our business. In 2016 we began salesof products based on the DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY FROZEN properties, which contributed to our performance. If we fail to meet our contractual commitments and/or any of these licenses were to terminate and not be renewed, or the popularity of anyof these licensed properties was to significantly decline, our business would be damaged and we would need to successfully develop and market other products to replace the products previously offered under license. Our license to the MARVEL property is granted from Marvel Entertainment, LLC and Marvel Characters B.V. (together Marvel). Ourlicense to the STAR WARS property is granted by Lucas Licensing Ltd. and Lucasfilm Ltd. (together Lucas). Both Marvel and Lucas are owned by The Walt Disney Company. Our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend, in large part, on our sales duringthe relatively brief holiday shopping season. This seasonality is exacerbated by retailers quick response inventory management techniques.  Sales of our toys, games and other family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from September through December in anticipation of theholiday season. This seasonality has increased over time, as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques. Further, ecommerce is growing significantly and accounting fora higher portion of the ultimate sales of our products to consumers. Ecommerce retailers tend to hold less inventory and take inventory closer to the time of sale to consumers than traditional retailers. As a result, customers are timing theirorders so that they are being filled by suppliers, such as us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. For toys, games and other family entertainment products which we produce, a majority of retail sales for the entire year generally occur inthe fourth quarter, close to the holiday season. As a consequence, the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from September through December, as our customers do not want to maintain largeon-hand inventories throughout the year ahead of consumer demand. While these techniques reduce a retailers investment in inventory, they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptlyand thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier.  The level of inventory carried byretailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us. If we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have sufficient time to produce andship enough additional products to fully meet consumer demand. Additionally, the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules, whichalso may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance. This seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital, mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season, and requiresaccurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers. Our failure to accurately predict andrespond to consumer demand, resulting in under producing popular items and/or overproducing less popular items, would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations.  In 2018 we experienced a negative impact to our business from retailers continuing efforts to reduce the amount of overall inventory they carry and minimize carry-forward inventory coming out of the holidayseason. Additionally, some retailers are increasing their use of automated inventory replenishment programs, which we believe drove a significant reduction in reorders of our products by these retailers in the last weeks of December 2018. Thesetrends negatively impacted our sales in 2018. If retailers continue to increase their use of automated replenishment programs, our inventory levels and sales may fluctuate, particularly in the fourth quarter.   18 Table of ContentsIn addition, as a result of the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly andadversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year, by unforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or economic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buyingpatterns during our key selling season, or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods, particularly from the Far East, during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season. The concentration of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing orpromotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us.  We depend upon a relatively smallretail customer base to sell the majority of our products. For the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Target Corporation accounted for approximately 20% and 9%, respectively,of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 38% of our consolidated net revenues. In the U.S. and Canada segment, approximately 60% of the net revenues of the segment were derivedfrom our top three customers. If one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing business with us, significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us, favorcompetitors or new entrants, increase their direct competition with us by expanding their private-label business, change their purchasing patterns, alter the manner in which they promote our products or the resources they devote to promoting andselling our products, or return substantial amounts of our products, it could significantly harm our sales, profitability and financial condition.  As an example of this, the bankruptcy filing by ToysRUs in the U.S. and Canada in September 2017, and in the United Kingdom in early 2018, and the subsequent liquidations of the Toys R Usbusiness in many markets globally during 2018, as well as the inability of ToysRUs to pay certain outstanding receivables, significantly reduced our sales and profitability in the fourth quarter of 2017 and throughout 2018. Theliquidation of millions of units of retail inventory held by ToysRUs into the market at closeout prices had a more substantial negative impact to sales of new products by us in 2018 than we, and industry experts, had initially expectedin early 2018.  Customers make no binding long-term commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by deliveringpurchase orders. Any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products. In addition, increased concentration among ourcustomers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers. Furthermore, thebankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our other significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and profitability.  Part of our strategy to remain relevant to children and families is to offer innovative products incorporating progressive technology, integrating digital and analog play. Theseproducts can be more difficult and expensive to design and manufacture which may reduce margins on some or a portion of these products compared to more traditional toys and games and such products may have short life spans. As childhood evolves and children become more interested in sophisticated product offerings, such as video games, consumer electronics and socialand digital media, at younger and younger ages, we have sought to keep our products relevant and interesting for these consumers. To continue capturing the interest of sophisticated youth, we must offer innovative childrens electronic toy andgame products. This is another key to our strategy; complementing analog play with digital integration and investing in technology development. These electronic and digital products, if successful, can be an effective way for us to connect withconsumers and increase our sales. However, childrens electronic and digital products, in addition to the risks associated with our other family entertainment products, also face certain additional risks. Costs associated with designing, developing and producing technologically advanced or sophisticated products tend to be higher than for many of ourother more traditional products, such as board games and action figures. The ability to sell enough of these advanced products, at prices high enough to recoup our costs and make a profit, is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronicsand entertainment products and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions. As a result, we can face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs and we may lose money on the development and sale of theseproducts. Additionally, designing, developing and producing technologically advanced or sophisticated products requires different competencies and follows different timelines than traditional toys and games. Delays in the design, development orproduction of these products incorporated into or associated with traditional toys and games could have a significant impact on our ability to successfully offer such products. In addition, the pace of change in product offerings and consumertastes in the electronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than   19 Table of Contentsfor our other products. This pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games. Our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the United States subject us to risks associated withinternational operations.  We operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the United States. For the yearended December 30, 2018, our net revenues from the International segment comprised approximately 40% of our total consolidated net revenues. We expect net revenues from our International segment to continue accounting for a significant portionof our revenues. In fact, over time, we expect our international sales and operations to continue to grow both in dollars and as a percentage of our overall business as a result of a key business strategy to expand our presence in emerging andunderserved international markets. Additionally, as we discuss below, we utilize third-party manufacturers primarily located in the Far East to produce most of our products. These international sales and manufacturing operations, includingoperations in emerging markets, are subject to risks that may significantly harm our sales, increase our costs or otherwise damage our business, including:      Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;      Potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross border transactions, which can materially increase our taxes and othercosts of doing business;      Political instability, civil unrest and economic instability;      Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;     Complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies and the evolution of laws andregulations and related enforcement;      Difficulties understanding the retail climate, consumer trends, local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be quite different from theUnited States;      Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and cost in recovering therefrom;     Transportation delays and interruptions;      Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another, including port congestion, strikes and other transportation delays and interruptions;     Increased investment and operational complexity to make our products compatible with systems in various countries and compliant with local laws;     Changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing business internationally; and     The imposition of tariffs, quotas, border adjustment taxes or other protectionist measures. To date tariffs have not had a material adverse impact to our overall business, and the only market in which we face significant tariffs currentlyis in Brazil, where substantial import tariffs have been in place and do negatively impact our ability to price our products competitively while remaining profitable. However, if tariffs were to be imposed on substantial quantities of our products,such as if the United States were to impose tariffs on substantial quantities of our products manufactured in China and imported into the United States, that could have a material negative impact on our business and damage our sales andprofitability, and take time to offset.  Because of the importance of international sales, sourcing and manufacturing to our business,our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business. Other economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we operate, including rising commodity and fuelprices, higher labor costs, increased transportation costs, outbreaks of public health pandemics or other diseases, or third party conduct could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products, and lower our revenues, margins andprofitability.  Various economic and public health conditions can impact our ability to manufacture and deliver products in atimely and cost-effective manner, or can otherwise have a significant negative impact on our revenues, profitability and business. Significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers, such as gasoline, home heating fuels, or groceries, may reducehousehold spending on the discretionary branded-play entertainment   20 Table of Contentsproducts we offer. As we discussed above, weakened economic conditions, lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer purchases of ourproducts. In 2018 our business was negatively impacted by weaker economic conditions in the United Kingdom and Brazil, two of our significant markets. Economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks, wars and otherconflicts, natural disasters, increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs, or the prospect of such events. Such a weakened economic and business climate, as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate, could harm our revenuesand profitability.  Our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products, but also on our ability to produceand sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit. Rising fuel and raw material prices, for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components, increased transportation costs, and increasedlabor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products, which in turn may reduce our margins, reduce our profitability and harm our business. Other conditions, such as the unavailability of sufficient quantities of electrical components, may impede our ability to manufacture, source andship new and continuing products on a timely basis. Additional factors outside of our control could further delay our products or increase the cost we pay to produce such products. For example, work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, an outbreak of asevere public health pandemic, a natural disaster or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts, all could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product. Any of these factors could result in product delays, increased costs and/orlost sales for our products.  We may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed materialhas less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties.  In addition to designing and developing products based on our own brands, we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests by producing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by thirdparties and licensed to us. The success of entertainment properties for which we have a license, such as MARVEL, STAR WARS, SESAME STREET, DISNEY PRINCESS, DISNEY FROZEN, DREAMWORKS TROLLS, YOKAI-WATCH or BEYBLADE, and the ability of us tosuccessfully market and sell related products, can significantly affect our revenues and profitability. If we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series, the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level ofconsumer interest in the associated products we are offering. In addition, competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure, maintain, and renew popular licenses to entertainment products onbeneficial terms, if at all, and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design, develop and market successful products based on these properties.  The license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial, and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup fromactual sales, which could result in write-offs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results of operations. At December 30, 2018, we had $72.7 million of prepaid royalties, $38.3 million of which are included in prepaidexpenses and other current assets and $34.4 million of which are included in other assets. Under the terms of existing contracts as of December 30, 2018, we may be required to pay additional future minimum guaranteed royalties and otherlicensing fees totaling approximately $387.8 million. Acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable, which may result in losing licenses that we currentlyhold when they become available for renewal, or missing business opportunities for new licenses. Additionally, as a licensee of entertainment-based properties we have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will translate into successfultoy, game or other family entertainment products, and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us.  We anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers toreduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future, as new entertainmentproperties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market. In the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainment licenses on advantageous terms, our revenues and profits may be harmed. Our use of third-party manufacturers to produce our products, as well as certain other products, presents risks to ourbusiness.  With the sale of our remaining manufacturing facilities in 2015, all of our products are now manufactured bythird-party manufacturers, the majority of which are located in China. Should changes be necessary, our external   21 Table of Contentssources of manufacturing can be shifted, over a significant period of time, to alternative sources of supply. If we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a materialportion of our product line due to political, civil, labor or other factors beyond our control, including natural disasters or pandemics, our operations may be substantially disrupted, potentially for a significant period of time. This delay couldsignificantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business while alternative sources of supply are secured.  Given thatour toy manufacturing is conducted by third-party manufacturers, the majority of whom are located in China, health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in China and affecting the movement of people and products intoand from China to our major markets, including North America and Europe, as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in China, could have a significant negative impact on our operations, revenues and earnings. Factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential significant revaluation of the Chinese Yuan, which may result inan increase in the cost of producing products in China, labor shortages and increases in labor costs in China as well as difficulties in moving products manufactured in China out of Asia and through the ports in North America and Europe, whether dueto port congestion, labor disputes, slow-downs, product regulations and/or inspections or other factors. Prolonged disputes or slowdowns at west coast ports can negatively impact both the time and cost of transporting goods into the United States.Natural disasters or health pandemics impacting China can also have a significant negative impact on our business.  Further, theimposition of tariffs, border adjustment taxes, trade sanctions or other regulations or economic penalties by the United States or the European Union against products imported by us from China or other foreign countries, or the loss of normaltrade relations status with China or other foreign countries in which we operate, could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the United States or Europe and harm our business. Additionally, the suspension of the operationsof a third-party manufacturer by government inspectors in China or another market in which we source products could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales. We have been working over the last several years to reduce our reliance on manufacturing in China, such as by moving production of certain productsto facilities in other countries like India, Vietnam and Mexico, as well as by increasing production of our products in other markets, including in the United States. We plan to continue those efforts in future years, but there is no guarantee wewill be as successful in these efforts as we plan. Furthermore, many of these newer production facilities, such as in India and Vietnam, raise other risks in that we are working with vendors who have not been manufacturing products like ours for aslong as historical vendors in China. That means these new vendors must successfully develop the capability to manufacture our products to the quality and safety standards we require. We require our third-party manufacturers to comply with our Global Business Ethics Principles, which are designed to prevent products manufacturedfor us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions. Our Global Business Ethics Principles address a number of issues, including working hours and compensation, health and safety, and abuse and discrimination. In addition, we requirethat our products supplied by third-party manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including consumer and product safety laws in the markets where those products are sold. Hasbro has the right and exercisessuch right, both directly and through the use of outside monitors, to monitor compliance by our third-party manufacturers with our Global Business Ethics Principles and other manufacturing requirements. In addition, we do quality assurance testingon our products, including products manufactured for us by third parties. Notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them, there is always a risk that one or more of our third-party manufacturers will notcomply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such non-compliance. Any failure of our third-party manufacturers to comply with labor, consumer, product safety or other applicablerequirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation, harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us.  If we are unable to successfully adapt to the evolution of gaming, our revenues and profitability may decline. Recognizing the critical need for increased innovation and a change in the way we go to market with gaming products in order to remain successful inthe gaming business in the future, we began implementing a strategy in 2011 to reinvent our gaming business. Our strategy to drive our gaming business in the future involved substantial changes in how we develop and market our gaming productsto consumers and how we position them at retail, with a focus on understanding consumer insights, rapidly identifying and understanding social media trends, understanding popular gaming mechanics and in delivering industry leading innovation ingaming, a change in our allocation of focus across gaming brands, greater penetration of our brands into digital gaming and the successful combination of analog and digital gaming. Our strategy involves making fundamental changes in how wedesign and develop our gaming products. We recognize the need to provide immersive game play that is easy for   22 Table of Contentsconsumers to learn and play in shorter periods of time, as well as offer innovative face to face, off the board and digital gaming opportunities. People are gaming in greater numbers thanever before, but the nature of gaming has and continues to evolve quickly. To be successful our gaming offerings must evolve to anticipate and meet these changes in consumer gaming. Our failure to successfully implement our strategy and tokeep up with the evolution of gaming could substantially harm our business, resulting in lost revenues and lost profits. Our success is critically dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees. Our officers and employees are at the heart of all of our efforts. It is their skill, innovation and hard work that drive oursuccess. We compete with many other potential employers in recruiting, hiring and retaining our senior management team and our many other skilled officers and other employees around the world. There is no guarantee that we will be able to recruit,hire or retain the senior management, officers and other employees we need to succeed. Additionally, we have experienced significant changes in our workforce from our restructuring efforts and the recruitment and hiring of new skill sets requiredfor our changing global business. We have added hundreds of employees in our global markets, in licensing and in entertainment and storytelling capabilities, while reducing our workforce in other areas over the last several years. Thesechanges in employee composition, both in terms of global distribution and in skill sets, have required changes in our business. Our loss of key management or other employees, or our inability to hire talented people with the skill sets we needfor our changing business, could significantly harm our business.  To remain competitive we mustcontinuously develop new skills and work to increase efficiency and reduce costs, but there is no guarantee we will be successful in this regard.  Our business is extremely competitive, the pace of change in our industry is getting faster and our competitors are always working to be more efficient and profitable. To compete we must continuously improveour processes, increase efficiency and work to reduce our expenses. We intend to achieve this partly by focusing on fewer, more global brand initiatives and through process improvements, including in global product development. However,there is no guarantee we will achieve our cost savings and efficiency enhancing goals and we may realize fewer benefits than are expected from these initiatives.  In 2018, in response to the continuing evolution of the global consumer landscape, shopping behaviors and the retail environment, we took certain actions as part of our ongoing efforts to transform and reimagineour business, to strengthen our connections with audiences and consumers, and enhance our ability to continue bringing meaningful brand experiences to life. These actions, defined earlier in this 10-K as the2018 restructuring program, included a commercial reorganization as well as adding new capabilities based on our understanding of changing consumer behaviors and how our retailers are going to market, while also changing many of the ways we organizeacross our brand blueprint. The actions also included headcount reductions aimed at right-sizing our cost-structure. Under the plan, we incurred pre-tax restructuringcharges of $17.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, and $72 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 relating to severance and other employee costs. Once these actions are completed, we expect that we will generate approximately$70 million to $80 million in gross annualized cost-reductions by 2020. The Company expects that approximately $65 million of these gross savings will be realized in 2019. In line with the objectives of this program, we plan toreinvest approximately $10 to $15 million in new resources in 2019, generating a net savings of approximately $50 million to $55 million in 2019. However, there is no guarantee that our restructuring actions will deliver thecost-reductions we currently estimate or that our ongoing efforts to evolve our business will be as successful as we plan.  Our business is critically dependent on our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully. Our intellectual property, including our trademarks and tradenames, copyrights, patents, and rights under our license agreements and otheragreements that establish our intellectual property rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, is of critical value. We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, patent and other proprietary rights lawsto protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands in the United States and around the world. From time to time, third parties have challenged, and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our intellectualproperty in the United States and around the world. In addition, our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights. We may need to resort to litigation to protect ourintellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. Similarly, third parties may claim ownership over certain aspects of our products or other intellectual property. Our failure to successfully protectour intellectual property rights could significantly harm our business and competitive position.   23 Table of ContentsWe have a material amount of acquired product rights which, ifimpaired, would result in a reduction of our net earnings.  Much of our intellectual property has been internally developed andhas no carrying value on our consolidated balance sheets. However, as of December 30, 2018, we had $693.8 million of acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. In 2018, based onestimates of future revenue from these rights, we recorded an impairment charge of $31.3 million. Declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed products or our decision to reduce our focus or exit these brands may impact ourability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge. Reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results. We have relied on external financing, including our credit facility, to help fund our operations. If we were unable toobtain or service such financing, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome, our business would be harmed.  Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our working capital needs, particularly those in the third and fourth quarters, we may rely on our commercial paper program, revolving credit facilityand our other credit facilities for working capital. However, in 2018, we did not borrow under our commercial paper program or revolving credit facility. We currently have a commercial paper program which, subject to market conditions, andavailability under our committed revolving credit facility, allows us to issue up to $1,000 million in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a source of working capital funding and liquidity. There is noguarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms, or at all, at any given point in time.  We also have arevolving credit agreement that expires in 2023, which provides for a $1,100.0 million committed revolving credit facility and a further source of working capital funding and liquidity. This facility also supports borrowings under ourcommercial paper program. The credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility. These restrictive covenants may limit ourfuture actions as well as our financial, operating and strategic flexibility. Non-compliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facilityand other bank lines, a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations. Not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing, but significant disruptions to creditmarkets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing. In times of severe economic downturn and/or distress in the credit markets, it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide fundingto us. In such a situation, it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities, and it might not be possible to find alternative sources of funding. We also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to time, through the issuance of debt securities. Our ability to issue such securities onsatisfactory terms, if at all, will depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interest rates, and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time ofthe offering. The condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securitiesor require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities. The failure to receive financing on desirable terms, or at all, could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other businessactivities.  As of December 30, 2018, we had $1,709.9 million of total principal amount of long-term debt outstanding. If weare unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default. There is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms, or at all. As a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation, we are subject to various governmentregulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future, violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business. In addition, we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls, whichcould harm our business.  As a manufacturer of consumer products, we are subject to significant government regulations,including, in the United States, under The Consumer Products Safety Act, The Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and The Flammable Fabrics Act, as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international  24 Table of Contentsmarkets. In addition, certain of our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration or similar international authorities. In addition, advertising to children is subjectto regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and a host of other agencies globally, and the collection of information from children under the age of thirteen is subject to the provisions of the ChildrensOnline Privacy Protection Act and other privacy laws around the world. The collection or personally identifiable information from anyone, including adults, is under increasing regulation in many markets, and in May of 2018 the General DataProtection Regulation became effective in the European Union. While we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance and failure to comply with theserequirements could result in fines, liabilities or sanctions which could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarilyconduct a product recall. While costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business, the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant.In addition, any product recall, regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations. Governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to productsafety and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations. In addition, one or more of our customers might require changes in our products, such asthe non-use of certain materials, in the future. Complying with any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business. Similarly, increased penalties for non-compliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations. Such increased costs or penalties could harm our business. As a large, multinational corporation, we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world, including antitrust, customs andtax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, environmental regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any suchlegal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition.  We may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures, or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization. Acquisitions and investments have been a component of our growth and the development of our business, and that is likely to continue in the future.Acquisitions can broaden and diversify our brand holdings and product offerings, and allow us to build additional capabilities and competencies around our brand blueprint. In reviewing potential acquisitions or investments, we target brands, assetsor companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products or offerings, the ability for us to leverage our family entertainment offerings, opportunities to drive our strategic brand blueprint and associated competencies, or othersynergies. In June of 2018 we acquired the POWER RANGERS brand from Saban Properties as we believe this brand has the potential to be developed successfully around our brand blueprint. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to developPOWER RANGERS as successfully as we believe we can. In the case of our joint venture with Discovery, we looked to partner with a company that has shown the ability to establish and operate compelling entertainment channels. Additionally, through ouracquisition of Backflip Studios, we looked to strengthen our mobile gaming expertise. We cannot be certain that the products and offerings of companies we may acquire, or acquire an interest in, will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers inthe future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products, develop our competencies or to grow our business.  In some cases, we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production, marketing and other operating, revenue or cost synergies which will produce greaterrevenue growth and profitability and, where applicable, cost savings, operating efficiencies and other advantages. However, we cannot be certain that these synergies, efficiencies and cost savings will be realized. Even if achieved, these benefitsmay be delayed or reduced in their realization. In other cases, we may acquire or invest in companies that we believe have strong and creative management, in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating theminto our operations. We cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products, entertainment or services in the future.There is no guarantee that any acquisition or investment we may make will be successful or beneficial, and acquisitions can consume significant amounts of management attention and other resources, which may negatively impact other aspects of ourbusiness.   25 Table of ContentsFailure to successfully operate our information systems andimplement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability.  We rely extensively onvarious information technology systems and software applications to manage many aspects of our business, including product development, management of our supply chain, sale and delivery of our products, financial reporting and various otherprocesses and transactions. We are critically dependent on the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems and related back-up systems. These systems are subject to damage orinterruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, malware and other security breaches, catastrophic events such as hurricanes, fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, acts of war or terrorism and usageerrors by our employees or partners. The efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems, including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or newtechnologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully. The failure of our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business, require significantcapital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability.  If our electronic data iscompromised our business could be significantly harmed.  We and our business partners maintain significant amounts of dataelectronically in locations around the world. This data relates to all aspects of our business, including current and future products and entertainment under development, and also contains certain customer, consumer, supplier, partner andemployee data. We maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data, but notwithstanding such protective measures, there is a risk of intrusion, cyber-attacks or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of thisdata. In addition, we provide confidential and proprietary information to our third-party business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business. While we obtain assurances from those parties that they havesystems and processes in place to protect such data, and where applicable, that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties, nonetheless those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromisethe protection of such data. Any compromise of the confidential data of our customers, consumers, suppliers, partners, employees or ourselves, or failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of or damage to this data through breach of our informationtechnology systems or other means could substantially disrupt our operations, harm our customers, consumers, employees and other business partners, damage our reputation, violate applicable laws and regulations, subject us to potentially significantcosts and liabilities and result in a loss of business that could be material.  From time to time, we areinvolved in litigation, arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense.  As a large multinational corporation, we are subject, from time to time, to regulatory investigations, litigation and arbitration disputes, including potential liability from personal injury or property damageclaims by the users of products that have been or may be developed by us as well as claims by third parties that our products infringe upon or misuse such third parties property or rights. Because the outcome of litigation, arbitration andregulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant cost for us and harm our business. The fact that we operate in a significant number of internationalmarkets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements. Any successful claim against us could significantly harm our business,financial condition and results of operations.  Changes in, or differing interpretations of, income taxlaws and rules, and changes in our geographic operating results, may impact our effective tax rate.  We are subject to incometaxes in the United States and in various international tax jurisdictions. We also conduct business activities between our operating units in various jurisdictions and we are subject to transfer pricing rules in the countries in which we operate.There is some degree of uncertainty and subjectivity in complying with transfer pricing rules. Our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in, or the interpretation of, tax laws or by changes in the amount of revenue and earnings we derive,or are determined to derive by tax authorities, from jurisdictions with differing tax rates.  On December 22, 2017 the U.S.government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code. We have complied with the Tax Act and all regulationsthat have been promulgated. Our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in, or the continuing interpretation of the Tax Act.   26 Table of ContentsIn addition, we may be subject to tax examinations by federal, state, and internationaljurisdictions, and these examinations can result in significant tax findings if the tax authorities interpret the application of laws and rules differently than we do or disagree with the intercompany rates we are applying. We assess the likelihoodof outcomes resulting from tax uncertainties. At December 30, 2018 we have a liability for uncertain tax benefits of $50.3 million. While we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome of these uncertain tax benefits, orresults of possible current or future tax examinations, may differ from our estimates and may have a significant adverse impact on our business and operating results.  We have a material amount of goodwill which, if it becomes impaired, would result in a reduction in our net earnings. Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire. Goodwill is not amortized and isrequired to be evaluated for impairment at least annually. At December 30, 2018, $485.9 million, or 9.2%, of our total assets represented goodwill. Declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units, which couldresult in a write-down of our goodwill and consequently harm our results of operations. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company took a number of actions to react to a rapidly changing mobile gaming industry that resulted changes to thelong-term projections for the Backflip business which led the Company to conclude the goodwill associated with the Backflip reporting unit was impaired. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $86.3 million for the year endedDecember 30, 2018.   "

.  Forward-Looking Information and Risk Factors
 That May Affect Future Results  From time to time, including in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our annual report to shareholders, we make forward-looking statements within the meaning ofthe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may relate to such matters as our business and marketing strategies, anticipated financial performance or business prospects in future periods,expected technological and product developments, the expected content of and timing for scheduled new product introductions or our expectations concerning the future acceptance of products by customers, the content and timing of plannedentertainment releases including motion pictures, television and digital content; and marketing and promotional efforts, research and development activities, liquidity, and similar matters. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risksand uncertainties. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. These statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as anticipate,believe, could, expect, intend, looking forward, may, planned, potential, should, will and would or any variations ofwords with similar meanings. We note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed or anticipated in our forward-looking statements. Thefactors listed below are illustrative and other risks and uncertainties may arise as are or may be detailed from time to time in our public announcements and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K. We undertake no obligation to make any revisions to the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Reporton Form 10-K or in our annual report to shareholders to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of the filing of this report. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all dollar or shareamounts herein are expressed in millions of dollars or shares, except for per share amounts.  Our strategyinvolves focusing on franchise and key partner brands, and successfully developing those brands across the brand blueprint in a wide array of innovative toys and games, consumer products, storytelling and digital experiences. If we are notsuccessful in developing and expanding these critical brands our business will suffer.  We have made a strategic decision tofocus on fewer, larger global brands as we build our business. We are moving away from SKU making behaviors, which involve building a large number of products across many brands, towards global brand building with an emphasis on developing ourfranchise and key partner brands, which we view as having the largest global potential. As we concentrate our efforts on a more select group of brands we can gain additional leverage and enhance the consumer experience. But this focus alsomeans that our future success   11 Table of Contentsdepends disproportionately on our ability to successfully develop this select group of brands across our brand blueprint and to maintain and extend the reach and relevance of these brands toglobal consumers in a wide array of markets. This strategy has required us to build and develop competencies in new areas, including storytelling, digital content and consumer products. Developing and growing these competencies has requiredsignificant effort, time and money.  In 2017 revenues from our seven franchise brands, LITTLEST PET SHOP, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, MONOPOLY,NERF, MY LITTLE PONY, PLAY-DOH and TRANSFORMERS, totaled 49% of our aggregate net revenues. Revenues from our key partner brands, including DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY FROZEN, MARVEL, STAR WARS,DREAMWORKS TROLLS, BEYBLADE and YO-KAI WATCH, constituted 24% of our aggregate net revenues in 2017. Together our franchise and partner brands account for the substantial majority of our revenues. If weare unable to successfully maintain and develop our franchise and key partner brands in the future, continue to drive their relevance to consumers and grow sales of products and storytelling experiences based on those brands, our revenues andprofits will decline and our business performance will suffer. In addition to continuing to grow and develop our existing franchise brands, successfully executing our brand strategy requires us to successfully develop other brands, such as currentemerging brands, and elevate them to franchise brand status over time. There is no guarantee that we will be able to do this successfully. As an example of this process, in February 2018 we elevated BABY ALIVE to franchise brand status and movedLITTLEST PET SHOP, which we are in the process of reinventing and which requires a different developmental approach at this point, out of Franchise Brands and into Emerging Brands. Consumer interests change rapidly, making it difficult to create storytelling experiences and to design and developproducts which will be popular with children and families, or to maintain the popularity of successful products and brands.  Theinterests of children and families evolve extremely quickly and can change dramatically from year to year. To be successful we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment content, products and play patterns which will capturechildrens and families interests and imagination and quickly develop and introduce innovative products which can compete successfully for consumers limited time, attention and spending. This challenge is more difficult withthe ever increasing utilization of technology and digital media in entertainment offerings, and the increasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers. Evolving consumer tastes and shifting interests, coupled with an ever changing andexpanding pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for childrens and families interest and acceptance, create an environment in which some products can fail to achieve consumer acceptance, and otherproducts can be popular during a certain period of time but then be rapidly replaced. As a result, individual childrens and family entertainment products and properties often have short consumer life cycles. If we devote time andresources to developing and marketing entertainment and products that consumers do not find interesting enough to buy in sufficient quantities to be profitable to us, our revenues and profits may decline and our business performance may be damaged.Similarly, if our product offerings and entertainment fail to correctly anticipate consumer interests our revenues and earnings will be reduced.  Additionally, our business is increasingly global and depends on interest in and acceptance of our childrens and family entertainment products and properties by consumers in diverse markets around the worldwith different tastes and preferences. As such, our success depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences in multiple markets and geographies and to design product and entertainmentofferings that can achieve popularity globally over a broad and diverse consumer audience. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop and market products with global appeal. The challenge of continuously developing and offering products and storytelling experiences that are sought after bychildren is compounded by the sophistication of todays children and the increasing array of technology and entertainment offerings available to them.  Children are increasingly utilizing electronic offerings such as tablet devices and mobile phones and they are expanding their interests to a wider array of innovative, technology-driven entertainment products anddigital and social media offerings at younger and younger ages. Our products compete with the offerings of consumer electronics companies, digital media and social media companies. To meet this challenge we, and our competitors, are designingand marketing products which incorporate increasing technology, seek to integrate digital and analog play, and aim to capitalize on new play patterns and increased consumption of digital and social media. With the increasing array of competitive entertainment offerings, there is no guarantee that:     Any of our brands, products or product lines will achieve popularity or continue to be popular;    12 Table of Contents   Any property for which we have a significant license will achieve or sustain popularity;     Any new products or product lines we introduce will be considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate market acceptance; or     Any products life cycle or sales quantities will be sufficient to permit us to profitably recover our development, manufacturing, marketing, royalties(including royalty advances and guarantees) and other costs of producing, marketing and selling the product.  Storytelling across media is an increasingly important factor for driving brand awareness and successfully building brands. Entertainment media, in forms such as television, motion pictures, digital content and other media, have become increasingly important platforms forconsumers to experience our brands and our partners brands and the success, or lack of success, of such media efforts can significantly impact the demand for our products and our financial performance. We spend considerable resources indesigning and developing products in conjunction with planned media releases, both by our partners and our own media releases. Not only our efforts, but the efforts of third parties, such as motion picture studios with whom we work, heavily impactthe timing of media development, release dates and the ultimate consumer interest in and success of these media efforts.  In 2017, wedeveloped and marketed significant product lines tied to the scheduled motion picture releases by key partners of DISNEYS BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, MARVELS GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2, SPIDERMAN: HOMECOMING, THOR:RAGNOROK and STARWARS: THE LAST JEDI. For 2018, we are developing and marketing significant product lines tied to the scheduled motion picture releases by key partners of a number of properties, including BLACK PANTHER, AVENGERS: INFINITY WARS, SOLO: A STAR WARSSTORY and ANT-MAN AND THE WASP. Those motion pictures are all being developed and released by our partners and our partners control the content and schedule for such motion pictures. Other key partner productlines we are offering, such as BEYBLADE and YOKAI-WATCH, depend on television support by our partners for their successes. Similarly, we are developing and marketing products for entertainment we play a more active role in developing or developourselves, such as TRANSFORMERS, MY LITTLE PONY and BUMBLEBEE. If those motion pictures, television shows, or any other key entertainment content for which we develop and market products are not as successful as we and our partners anticipate, ourrevenues and earnings will fall. As an example, in the fourth quarter of 2017 our sales of products related to STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI were significantly below our expectations and that was a factor that caused us to miss our revenue expectationsfor that quarter.  The ultimate timing and success of such projects is critically dependent on the efforts and schedules of ourlicensors, and studio and media partners. We do not fully control when or if any particular motion picture projects will be greenlit, developed or released, and our licensors or media partners may change their plans with respect to projects andrelease dates or cancel development all together. This can make it difficult for us to get feature films developed, plan future entertainment slates and to successfully develop and market products in conjunction with future motion picture andother media releases, given the lengthy lead times involved in product development and successful marketing efforts, and the fact that third party partners of ours may decide not to develop such entertainment. When we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases, those statements are based on our current plans and expectations.Unforeseen factors may increase the cost of these releases, delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation. Any delay or cancellation of planned product development work, introductions, or media support may decrease the number ofproducts we sell and harm our business.  Lack of sufficient consumer interest in entertainment media weproduce or for which we offer products can harm our business.  Motion pictures, television, digital content or other media we produce or forwhich we develop products may not be as popular with consumers as we anticipated. While it is difficult to anticipate what products may be sought after by consumers, it can be even more difficult to properly predict the popularity of mediaefforts and properties given the broad array of competing offerings. If our or our partners media efforts, and related product offerings, fail to garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance, our revenues and the financial return fromsuch efforts will be harmed.  Under the relationship we entered with Paramount in October 2017 we plan to play a bigger role in theproduction and financing of motion pictures based on our properties. That has the advantage of giving us more input to what properties are developed into motion pictures and when, and can allow us to earn a greater return from successful films, butit also increases the money we will directly spend on film production and puts that   13 Table of Contentsinvestment at risk. If our motion pictures are not as successful as we anticipate they will be, or if we are not able to produce and distribute films according to the schedule we have planned,our financial performance will be negatively impacted.  Discovery Family Channel, our cable television joint venture with DiscoveryCommunications, Inc. in the United States, competes with a number of other childrens television networks for viewers, advertising revenue and distribution fees. There is no guarantee that Discovery Family Channel will be successful. Similarly,Hasbro Studios programming distributed both domestically and internationally, Allspark Animation and Allspark Pictures releases and Backflip Studios digital products compete with content from many other parties. Lack of consumer interestin and acceptance of content developed by Hasbro Studios, Allspark Animation, Allspark Pictures and Backflip Studios, or other content appearing on Discovery Family Channel, and products related to that content, could significantly harm ourbusiness. Similarly, our business could be harmed by greater than expected costs, or unexpected delays or difficulties, associated with our investment in Discovery Family Channel, such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or inbuilding advertising revenues for Discovery Family Channel. During 2017 we spent $48.0 million for television programming and film projects being developed by Hasbro Studios and we anticipate that we will continue spending at comparable orhigher levels in 2018 and future years.  At December 31, 2017, $238.0 million, or 4.5%, of our total assets, represented ourinvestments in the Discovery Family Channel. If the Discovery Family Channel is not successful our investments may become impaired, which could result in a write-down through net earnings. The childrens and family entertainment industry and consumer products industry are highly competitive and thebarriers to entry are low. If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors or with our retailers private label toy products our revenues, market share and profitability could decline. The childrens and family entertainment industry and the consumer products industry are, and will continue to be, highly competitive. Wecompete in the United States and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers, marketers, and sellers of analog toys and games, digital gaming products, digital media, products which combine analog and digital play, and otherentertainment and consumer products, as well as with retailers who offer such products under their own private labels. In addition, we compete with other companies who are focused on building their brands across multiple product and consumercategories. Across our business, we face competitors who are constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends, seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products forconsumer acceptance and purchase.  In addition to existing competitors, the barriers to entry for new participants in the childrensand family entertainment industry and in the consumer products industry are low, and the increasing importance of digital media, and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest, has further increased the ability for newparticipants to enter our markets, and has broadened the array of companies we compete with. New participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for ourproducts in a very short period of time. These existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences. Our competitors products may achieve greater market acceptance than our productsand potentially reduce demand for our products, lower our revenues and lower our profitability.  In recent years, retailers have alsodeveloped their own private-label products that directly compete with the products of traditional manufacturers and brand owners. Some retail chains that are our customers sell private-label childrens and family entertainment productsdesigned, manufactured and branded by the retailers themselves. These products may be sold at prices lower than our prices for comparable products, which may result in lower purchases of our products by these retailers and may reduce our marketshare.  An inability to develop and introduce planned products, product lines and new brands in a timelyand cost-effective manner may damage our business.  In developing products, product lines and new brands we have anticipated dates for theassociated product and brand introductions. When we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a particular product, product line or brand at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associateddevelopment, implementation, and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule. There is no guarantee that we will be able to manufacture, source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on acost-effective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands. This risk is heightened by our customers compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business. Further, ecommerce is growing significantly and accountingfor a higher portion of the ultimate sales of our products to   14 Table of Contentsconsumers. Ecommerce retailers tend to hold less inventory and take inventory closer to the time of sale to consumers than traditional retailers. The risk is also exacerbated by the increasingsophistication of many of the products we are designing, and brands we are developing in terms of combining digital and analog technologies, utilizing digital media to a greater degree, and providing greater innovation and productdifferentiation. Unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process, significant increases in the planned cost of development, or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction datefor products to be later than anticipated, may reduce or eliminate the profitability of such products or, in some situations, may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance. Our global operations mean we produce and buy products, and sell products, in many different jurisdictions with many differentcurrencies. As a result, if the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes, our financial results as reported in U.S. dollars, may bemeaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected. As an example, if the dollar appreciates 10% relative to a local currency for an international market in which we had $200 million of net revenues,the dollar value of those sales, as they are translated into U.S. dollars, would decrease by $20 million in our consolidated financial results. As such, we would recognize a $20 million decrease in our net revenues, even if the actuallevel of sales in the foreign market had not changed. Similarly, our expenses can be significantly impacted, in U.S. dollar terms, by exchange rates, meaning the profitability of our business in U.S. dollar terms can be negatively impactedby exchange rate movements which we do not control. During 2015 and 2016, certain key currencies, such as the Euro, Russian Ruble, and Brazilian Real depreciated significantly compared to the U.S. dollar. This depreciation had a significant negativeimpact on our revenues and earnings. Depreciation in key currencies during 2018 and beyond may have a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings as they are reported in U.S. dollars. Global and regional economic downturns that negatively impact the retail and credit markets, or that otherwise damagethe financial health of our retail customers and consumers, can harm our business and financial performance.  We design,manufacture and market a wide variety of entertainment and consumer products worldwide through sales to our retail customers and directly to consumers. Our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending in themarkets in which we operate. Recessions, credit crises and other economic downturns, or disruptions in credit markets, in the United States and in other markets in which our products are marketed and sold can result in lower levels of economicactivity, lower employment levels, less consumer disposable income, and lower consumer confidence. Similarly, reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers, such as their homes or stock market investments, can lower consumer confidence andconsumer spending power. Any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products. This in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability. In addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our products during times of economic difficulty, in an effort to maintain sales duringsuch times we may need to reduce the price of our products, increase our promotional spending and/or sales allowances, or take other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products. Those steps may lower our net revenues orincrease our costs, thereby decreasing our operating margins and lowering our profitability.  As an example of these risks, our revenuesand profitability for 2017 were negatively impacted by economic downturns and resulting lower sales of our products in the United Kingdom and in Brazil. The economic downturn in the United Kingdom was partly caused by uncertainly around Brexit. Ifthese markets, or other significant markets, experience economic difficulties in 2018 it can harm our business and financial results.  An increasing portion of our business is expected to come from emerging markets, and growing business in emerging markets presents additional challenges. We expect an increasing portion of our net revenues to come from emerging markets in the future, including Eastern Europe, Latin America, Africa andAsia. In 2017 revenues in emerging markets constituted approximately 14% of our net revenues, up from only 6% of our net revenues in 2010. Over time, we expect our emerging market net revenues to continue to grow both in absolute terms and as apercentage of our overall business as one of our key business strategies is to increase our presence in emerging and underserved international markets. Operating in an increasing number of markets, each with its own unique consumer preferencesand business climates, presents additional challenges that we must meet. In addition to the need to successfully anticipate and serve different   15 Table of Contentsglobal consumer preferences and interests, sales and operations in emerging markets that we have entered, may enter, or may increase our presence in, are subject to other risks associated withinternational operations, including:      Complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies and the evolution of laws andregulations that impact our product offerings and related enforcement;      Potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross border transactions;     Difficulties understanding the retail climate, consumer trends, local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be quite different from theUnited States;      Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another, including port congestion, strikes and other transportation delays and interruptions;and      The imposition of tariffs, border adjustment taxes, quotas, or other protectionist measures. Because of the importance of our emerging market net revenues, our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if any of the risksdescribed above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our emerging market business. Our business depends in large part on the success of our key partner brands and on our ability to maintain and extendsolid relationships with our key partners.  As part of our strategy, in addition to developing and marketing products based onproperties we own or control, we also seek to obtain licenses enabling us to develop and market products based on popular entertainment properties owned by third parties.  We currently have in-licenses to several successful entertainment properties, including MARVEL and STAR WARS, as well as DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY FROZEN. Theselicenses typically have multi-year terms and provide us with the right to market and sell designated classes of products. In recent years our sales of products under the MARVEL and STAR WARS licenses have been highly significant to ourbusiness. In 2016 we began sales of products based on the DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY FROZEN properties, which contributed significantly to our performance. If we fail to meet our contractual commitments and/or any of these licenses were toterminate and not be renewed, or the popularity of any of these licensed properties was to significantly decline, our business would be damaged and we would need to successfully develop and market other products to replace the products previouslyoffered under license.  Our license to the MARVEL property is granted from Marvel Entertainment, LLC and Marvel Characters B.V. (togetherMarvel). Our license to the STAR WARS property is granted by Lucas Licensing Ltd. and Lucasfilm Ltd. (together Lucas). Both Marvel and Lucas are owned by The Walt Disney Company. Our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend, in large part, on our sales duringthe relatively brief holiday shopping season. This seasonality is exacerbated by retailers quick response inventory management techniques.  Sales of our toys, games and other family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from September through December in anticipation of theholiday season. This seasonality has increased over time, as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques. Further, ecommerce is growing significantly and accounting fora higher portion of the ultimate sales of our products to consumers. Ecommerce retailers tend to hold less inventory and take inventory closer to the time of sale to consumers than traditional retailers. As a result, customers are timing theirorders so that they are being filled by suppliers, such as us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. For toys, games and other family entertainment products which we produce, a majority of retail sales for the entire year generally occur inthe fourth quarter, close to the holiday season. As a consequence, the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from September through December, as our customers do not want to maintain largeon-hand inventories throughout the year ahead of consumer demand. While these techniques reduce a retailers investment in inventory, they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptlyand thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier.  The level of inventory carried byretailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us. If we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have sufficient time to produce andship enough additional products to fully meet consumer demand. Additionally, the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that   16 Table of Contentswe will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance. This seasonal pattern requires significant use of workingcapital, mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popularproducts or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers. Our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand, resulting in under producing popular items and/or overproducing less popular items, wouldreduce our total sales and harm our results of operations. In addition, as a result of the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spreadmore evenly throughout the year, by unforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or economic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events such as strikes or port delays that interferewith the shipment of goods, particularly from the Far East, during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season.  The concentration of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have asignificant impact on us.  We depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products. For thefiscal year ended December 31, 2017, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Toys R Us, Inc. and Target Corporation, accounted for approximately 19%, 9% and 9%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenuesand our five largest customers, including Wal-Mart, Toys R Us and Target, in the aggregate accounted for approximately 42% of our consolidated net revenues. In the U.S. and Canada segment,approximately 61% of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers. If one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing business with us,significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us, favor competitors or new entrants, increase their direct competition with us by expanding their private-label business, change their purchasing patterns, alter the manner in which theypromote our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products, or return substantial amounts of our products, it could significantly harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. As an example of this, thebankruptcy filing by Toys R Us in the U.S. and Canada in September 2017, and associated reductions in inventory taken by Toys R Us for the holiday season, as well as the inability of Toys R Us to pay certainoutstanding receivables, significantly impacted our sales and profitability in the fourth quarter of 2017. We expect the ongoing financial situation with Toys R Us, including its difficulties in the United Kingdom, will negatively impactour sales in 2018, with the greatest amount of that impact likely to be in the first half of 2018, and potentially for additional periods, based on the level of store closures and how much the sales lost through Toys R Us are picked upby other retail and e-commerce channels.  Customers make no binding long-term commitments to usregarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders. Any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products, and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for ourproducts. In addition, increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there wereless consolidation among our customers. Furthermore, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and profitability. Part of our strategy to remain relevant to children and families is to offer innovative products incorporatingprogressive technology, integrating digital and analog play. These products can be more difficult and expensive to design and manufacture which may reduce margins on some or a portion of these products compared to more traditional toys and games andsuch products may have short life spans.  As childhood evolves and children become more interested in sophisticated productofferings, such as video games, consumer electronics and social and digital media, at younger and younger ages, we have sought to keep our products relevant and interesting for these consumers. To continue capturing the interest of sophisticatedyouth, we must offer innovative childrens electronic toy and game products. This is another key to our strategy; complementing analog play with digital integration and investing in technology development. These electronic and digital products,if successful, can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase our sales. However, childrens electronic and digital products, in addition to the risks associated with our other family entertainment products, also facecertain additional risks.  Costs associated with designing, developing and producing technologically advanced or sophisticated productstend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products, such as board games and action figures. The ability to sell enough of these advanced products, at prices high enough to recoup our costs and make a profit, is constrained byheavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment products, and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions. As a result, we can face increased risk of not achieving sales  17 Table of Contentssufficient to recover our costs and we may lose money on the development and sale of these products. Additionally, designing, developing and producing technologically advanced or sophisticatedproducts requires different competencies and follows different timelines than traditional toys and games. Delays in the design, development or production of these products incorporated into or associated with traditional toys and games couldhave a significant impact on our ability to successfully offer such products. In addition, the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than for our otherproducts. This pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games.  Our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the United States subject us to risks associated with international operations. We operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the United States. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our net revenuesfrom the International segment comprised approximately 43% of our total consolidated net revenues. We expect net revenues from our International segment to continue accounting for a significant portion of our revenues. In fact, over time, we expectour international sales and operations to continue to grow both in dollars and as a percentage of our overall business as a result of a key business strategy to expand our presence in emerging and underserved international markets. Additionally, aswe discuss below, we utilize third-party manufacturers primarily located in the Far East to produce most of our products. These international sales and manufacturing operations, including operations in emerging markets , are subject to risks thatmay significantly harm our sales, increase our costs or otherwise damage our business, including:      Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;      Potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross border transactions, which can materially increase our taxes and othercosts of doing business;      Political instability, civil unrest and economic instability;      Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;     Complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies and the evolution of laws andregulations and related enforcement;      Difficulties understanding the retail climate, consumer trends, local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be quite different from theUnited States;      Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and cost in recovering therefrom;     Transportation delays and interruptions;      Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another, including port congestion, strikes and other transportation delays and interruptions;     Increased investment and operational complexity to make our products compatible with systems in various countries and compliant with local laws;     Changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing business internationally; and     The imposition of tariffs, quotas, border adjustment taxes or other protectionist measures. Because of the importance of international sales, sourcing and manufacturing to our business, our financial condition and results of operationscould be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business.  Other economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we operate, including rising commodity and fuel prices, higher labor costs, increased transportation costs, outbreaksof public health pandemics or other diseases, or third party conduct could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products, and lower our revenues, margins and profitability. Various economic and public health conditions can impact our ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and cost-effective manner, orcan otherwise have a significant negative impact on our revenues, profitability and business.  Significant increases in the costs ofother products which are required by consumers, such as gasoline, home heating fuels, or groceries, may reduce household spending on the discretionary branded-play entertainment   18 Table of Contentsproducts we offer. As we discussed above, weakened economic conditions, lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer purchases of ourproducts. In 2017 our business was negatively impacted by weaker economic conditions in the United Kingdom and Brazil, two of our significant markets. Economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks, wars and otherconflicts, natural disasters, increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs, or the prospect of such events. Such a weakened economic and business climate, as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate, could harm our revenuesand profitability.  Our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products, but also on our ability to produceand sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit. Rising fuel and raw material prices, for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components, increased transportation costs, and increasedlabor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products, which in turn may reduce our margins, reduce our profitability and harm our business. Other conditions, such as the unavailability of sufficient quantities of electrical components, may impede our ability to manufacture, source andship new and continuing products on a timely basis. Additional factors outside of our control could further delay our products or increase the cost we pay to produce such products. For example, work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, an outbreak of asevere public health pandemic, a natural disaster or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts, all could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product. Any of these factors could result in product delays, increased costs and/orlost sales for our products.  We may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed materialhas less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties.  In addition to designing and developing products based on our own brands, we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests by producing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by thirdparties and licensed to us. The success of entertainment properties for which we have a license, such as MARVEL, STAR WARS, SESAME STREET, DISNEY PRINCESS, DISNEY FROZEN, TROLLS, YOKAI-WATCH or BEYBLADE, and the ability of us to successfully marketand sell related products, can significantly affect our revenues and profitability. If we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series, the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest inthe associated products we are offering. In addition, competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure, maintain, and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms, if at all,and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design, develop and market successful products based on these properties. The license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial, and in somecases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales, which could result in write-offs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results of operations. At December 31, 2017, we had $81.5 million ofprepaid royalties, $31.4 million of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $50.1 million of which are included in other assets. Under the terms of existing contracts as of December 31, 2017, we may berequired to pay additional future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately $279.6 million. Acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be toohigh to be profitable, which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal, or missing business opportunities for new licenses. Additionally, as a licensee of entertainment-based properties we have noguaranty that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy, game or other family entertainment products, and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us. We anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably sell licensed productsbased on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful ormaintain a high level of sales in the future, as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market. In the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainment licenses onadvantageous terms, our revenues and profits may be harmed.  Our use of third-party manufacturers toproduce our products, as well as certain other products, presents risks to our business.  With the sale of our remainingmanufacturing facilities in 2015, all of our products are now manufactured by third-party manufacturers, the majority of which are located in China. Should changes be necessary, our external   19 Table of Contentssources of manufacturing can be shifted, over a significant period of time, to alternative sources of supply. If we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a materialportion of our product line due to political, civil, labor or other factors beyond our control, including natural disasters or pandemics, our operations may be substantially disrupted, potentially for a significant period of time. This delay couldsignificantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business while alternative sources of supply are secured.  Given thatour toy manufacturing is conducted by third-party manufacturers, the majority of whom are located in China, health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in China and affecting the movement of people and products intoand from China to our major markets, including North America and Europe, as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in China, could have a significant negative impact on our operations, revenues and earnings. Factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential significant revaluation of the Chinese Yuan, which may result inan increase in the cost of producing products in China, labor shortages and increases in labor costs in China as well as difficulties in moving products manufactured in China out of Asia and through the ports in North America and Europe, whether dueto port congestion, labor disputes, slow-downs, product regulations and/or inspections or other factors. Prolonged disputes or slowdowns at west coast ports can negatively impact both the time and cost of transporting goods into the United States.Natural disasters or health pandemics impacting China can also have a significant negative impact on our business.  Further, theimposition of tariffs, border adjustment taxes, trade sanctions or other regulations or economic penalties by the United States or the European Union against products imported by us from China or other foreign countries, or the loss of normaltrade relations status with China or other foreign countries in which we operate, could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the United States or Europe and harm our business. Additionally, the suspension of the operationsof a third-party manufacturer by government inspectors in China or another market in which we source products could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales. We require our third-party manufacturers to comply with our Global Business Ethics Principles, which are designed to prevent products manufacturedfor us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions. Our Global Business Ethics Principles address a number of issues, including working hours and compensation, health and safety, and abuse and discrimination. In addition, we requirethat our products supplied by third-party manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including consumer and product safety laws in the markets where those products are sold. Hasbro has the right and exercisessuch right, both directly and through the use of outside monitors, to monitor compliance by our third-party manufacturers with our Global Business Ethics Principles and other manufacturing requirements. In addition, we do quality assurance testingon our products, including products manufactured for us by third parties. Notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them, there is always a risk that one or more of our third-party manufacturers will notcomply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such non-compliance. Any failure of our third-party manufacturers to comply with labor, consumer, product safety or other applicablerequirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation, harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us.  If we are unable to successfully adapt to the evolution of gaming, our revenues and profitability may decline. Recognizing the critical need for increased innovation and a change in the way we go to market with gaming products in order to remain successful inthe gaming business in the future, we began implementing a strategy in 2011 to reinvent our gaming business. Our strategy to drive our gaming business in the future involved substantial changes in how we develop and market our gaming productsto consumers and how we position them at retail, with a focus on understanding consumer insights, rapidly identifying and understanding social media trends, understanding popular gaming mechanics and in delivering industry leading innovation ingaming, a change in our allocation of focus across gaming brands, greater penetration of our brands into digital gaming and the successful combination of analog and digital gaming. Our strategy involves making fundamental changes in how wedesign and develop our gaming products. We recognize the need to provide immersive game play that is easy for consumers to learn and play in shorter periods of time, as well as offer innovative face to face, off the board and digital gamingopportunities. People are gaming in greater numbers than ever before, but the nature of gaming has and continues to evolve quickly. To be successful our gaming offerings must evolve to anticipate and meet these changes in consumergaming. Our failure to successfully implement our strategy and to keep up with the evolution of gaming could substantially harm our business, resulting in lost revenues and lost profits.   20 Table of ContentsOur success is critically dependent on the efforts and dedication ofour officers and other employees.  Our officers and employees are at the heart of all of our efforts. It is their skill,innovation and hard work that drive our success. We compete with many other potential employers in recruiting, hiring and retaining our senior management team and our many other skilled officers and other employees around the world. There is noguarantee that we will be able to recruit, hire or retain the senior management, officers and other employees we need to succeed. Additionally, we have experienced significant changes in our workforce from our restructuring efforts and therecruitment and hiring of new skill sets required for our changing global business. We have added hundreds of employees in our global markets, in licensing and in entertainment and storytelling capabilities, while reducing our workforce inother areas over the last several years. These changes in employee composition, both in terms of global distribution and in skill sets, have required changes in our business. Our loss of key management or other employees, or our inabilityto hire talented people with the skill sets we need for our changing business, could significantly harm our business. To remain competitive we must continuously work to increase efficiency and reduce costs, but there is no guarantee wewill be successful in this regard.  Our business is extremely competitive, the pace of change in our industry is getting fasterand our competitors are always working to be more efficient and profitable. To compete we must continuously improve our processes, increase efficiency and work to reduce our expenses. We intend to achieve this partly by focusing on fewer,more global brand initiatives and through process improvements, including in global product development. However, these actions are no guarantee we will achieve our cost savings goal and we may realize fewer benefits than are expected from thisinitiative.  Our business is critically dependent on our intellectual property rights and we may not beable to protect such rights successfully.  Our intellectual property, including our trademarks and tradenames, copyrights,patents, and rights under our license agreements and other agreements that establish our intellectual property rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, is of critical value. We rely on a combination of trade secret,copyright, trademark, patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands in the United States and around the world. From time to time, third parties have challenged, and may in thefuture try to challenge, our ownership of our intellectual property in the United States and around the world. In addition, our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual propertyrights. We may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. Similarly, third parties may claim ownership over certain aspects of our products or otherintellectual property. Our failure to successfully protect our intellectual property rights could significantly harm our business and competitive position.  We have a material amount of acquired product rights which, if impaired, would result in a reduction of our net earnings. Much of our intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our consolidated balance sheets. However, as ofDecember 31, 2017, we had $217.4 million of acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed products or our decision toreduce our focus or exit these brands may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge. Reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results. We rely on external financing, including our credit facility, to help fund our operations. If we wereunable to obtain or service such financing, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome, our business would be harmed.  Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our working capital needs, particularly those in the third and fourth quarters, we rely on our commercial paper program, revolving credit facility andour other credit facilities for working capital. We currently have a commercial paper program which, subject to market conditions, and availability under our committed revolving credit facility, allows us to issue up to $1,000 million inaggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a source of working capital funding and liquidity. There is no guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms, or at all, at any given point in time.  21 Table of ContentsWe also have a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2020, which provides for a$1,000 million committed revolving credit facility and a further source of working capital funding and liquidity. This facility also supports borrowings under our commercial paper program. The credit agreement contains certain restrictivecovenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility. These restrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial, operating and strategicflexibility. In addition, our financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility. Our performance and financial condition may not meet our original expectations, causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants. Non-compliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines, a circumstance which potentially could occur when operatingshortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations.  Not only may our individualfinancial performance impact our ability to access sources of external financing, but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing. In times of severe economic downturn and/or distress in thecredit markets, it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us. In such a situation, it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities, and itmight not be possible to find alternative sources of funding.  We also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to time,through the issuance of debt securities. Our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interestrates, and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future.Variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities. The failure to receive financing on desirable terms, or at all, could damage ourability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities.  As of December 31, 2017, we had$1,709.9 million of total principal amount of long-term debt outstanding. If we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default. There is no guaranteethat we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms, or at all.  As a manufacturer of consumerproducts and a large multinational corporation, we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future, violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business. Inaddition, we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls, which could harm our business.  As amanufacturer of consumer products, we are subject to significant government regulations, including, in the United States, under The Consumer Products Safety Act, The Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and The Flammable Fabrics Act, as well as underproduct safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets. In addition, certain of our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration or similar international authorities. In addition, advertising tochildren is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and a host of other agencies globally, and the collection of information from children under the age of thirteen is subject to the provisions ofthe Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act and other privacy laws around the world. The collection or personally identifiable information from anyone, including adults, is under increasing regulation in many markets, and in May of 2018 theGeneral Data Protection Regulation will become effective in the European Union. While we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance and failure tocomply with these acts could result in sanctions which could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct aproduct recall. While costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business, the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant. Inaddition, any product recall, regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations. Governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to productsafety and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations. In addition, one or more of our customers might require changes in our products, such asthe non-use of certain materials, in the future. Complying with any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business. Similarly, increased penalties for non-compliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our   22 Table of Contentsproducts were found to not comply with such regulations. Such increased costs or penalties could harm our business.  As a large, multinational corporation, we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world, including antitrust, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, environmentalregulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetaryliabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition.  We may notrealize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures, or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization.  Acquisitions and investments have been a component of our growth and the development of our business, and that is likely to continue in the future. Acquisitions can broaden and diversify our brand holdings andproduct offerings, and allow us to build additional capabilities and competencies around our brand blueprint. In reviewing potential acquisitions or investments, we target companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products orofferings, the ability for us to leverage our family entertainment offerings, opportunities to drive our strategic brand blueprint and associated competencies, or other synergies. In the case of our joint venture with Discovery, we looked to partnerwith a company that has shown the ability to establish and operate compelling entertainment channels. Additionally, through our acquisition of Backflip Studios, we looked to strengthen our mobile gaming expertise. However, we cannot be certainthat the products and offerings of companies we may acquire, or acquire an interest in, will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market ourproducts, develop our competencies or to grow our business.  In some cases, we expect that the integration of the companies that we mayacquire into our operations will create production, marketing and other operating, revenue or cost synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and, where applicable, cost savings, operating efficiencies and otheradvantages. However, we cannot be certain that these synergies, efficiencies and cost savings will be realized. Even if achieved, these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization. In other cases, we may acquire or invest in companiesthat we believe have strong and creative management, in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations. We cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies wouldcontinue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products, entertainment or services in the future. There is no guarantee that any acquisition or investment we may make will be successful or beneficial,and acquisitions can consume significant amounts of management attention and other resources, which may negatively impact other aspects of our business.  Failure to successfully operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability. We rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications to manage many aspects of our business, including productdevelopment, management of our supply chain, sale and delivery of our products, financial reporting and various other processes and transactions. We are critically dependent on the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systemsand related back-up systems. These systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, malware and other security breaches,catastrophic events such as hurricanes, fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees. The efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems,including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully. The failure of our information systems to perform asdesigned or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business, require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability. If our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed. We maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world. This data relates to all aspects of our business, including current andfuture products and entertainment under development, and also contains certain customer, consumer, supplier, partner and employee data. We maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data, but notwithstanding such protectivemeasures, there is a risk of intrusion, cyber attacks or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data. In addition, we provide confidential and proprietary information to our third-party business partners in certaincases where doing so is necessary to conduct   23 Table of Contentsour business. While we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data, and where applicable, that they will take steps to assure theprotections of such data by third parties, nonetheless those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of such data. Any compromise of the confidential data of our customers, consumers, suppliers,partners, employees or ourselves, or failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of or damage to this data through breach of our information technology systems or other means could substantially disrupt our operations, harm our customers, consumers,employees and other business partners, damage our reputation, violate applicable laws and regulations, subject us to potentially significant costs and liabilities and result in a loss of business that could be material. From time to time, we are involved in litigation, arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain andwhich could entail significant expense.  As a large multinational corporation, we are subject, from time to time, to regulatoryinvestigations, litigation and arbitration disputes, including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of products that have been or may be developed by us as well as claims by third parties that our productsinfringe upon or misuse such third parties property or rights. Because the outcome of litigation, arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters couldentail significant cost for us and harm our business. The fact that we operate in a significant number of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number ofvarying legal and regulatory requirements. Any successful claim against us could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Changes in, or differing interpretations of, income tax laws and rules, and changes in our geographic operating results, may impact our effective tax rate. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in various international tax jurisdictions. We also conduct business activities between ouroperating units in various jurisdictions and we are subject to transfer pricing rules in the countries in which we operate. There is some degree of uncertainty and subjectivity in complying with transfer pricing rules. Our effective tax rate couldbe impacted by changes in, or the interpretation of, tax laws or by changes in the amount of revenue and earnings we derive, or are determined to derive by tax authorities, from jurisdictions with differing tax rates. On December 22, 2017 the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TaxAct). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that affected 2017, including the requirement for the Company to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings offoreign subsidiaries that is payable over eight years. The Tax Act also established new tax laws that will affect 2018 and future years, including, but not limited to, (i) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent;(ii) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (iii) requiring a current inclusion in U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations; (iv) creating anew limitation on deductible interest expense; and (v) imposing limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation. The Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed, significant judgments to be made in interpretation ofthe provisions of the Tax Act and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced by the Company. The U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service, andother standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered, with a possible retroactive effect, which is different from our interpretation. As we complete our analysisof the Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance, we may make adjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which theadjustments are made.  In addition, we may be subject to tax examinations by federal, state, and international jurisdictions, and theseexaminations can result in significant tax findings if the tax authorities interpret the application of laws and rules differently than we do or disagree with the intercompany rates we are applying. We assess the likelihood of outcomes resultingfrom tax uncertainties. At December 31, 2017 we have a liability for uncertain tax benefits of $89.4 million. While we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome of these uncertain tax benefits, or results of possiblecurrent or future tax examinations, may differ from our estimates and may have a significant adverse impact on our business and operating results.   24 Table of ContentsWe have a material amount of goodwill which, if it becomes impaired, would result ina reduction in our net earnings.  Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the netassets we acquire. Goodwill is not amortized and is required to be evaluated for impairment at least annually. At December 31, 2017, $573.1 million, or 10.8%, of our total assets represented goodwill. Declines in our profitability mayimpact the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in a write-down of our goodwill and consequently harm our results of operations. While we did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges in 2017, during the fourth quarter of 2016,in conjunction with the Companys annual review for impairment, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $32.9 million related to Backflip Studios reducing the related goodwill to $86.3 million. In the future, should BackflipStudios not achieve its profitability and growth targets, including anticipated game releases in 2018 and beyond, the carrying value may become further impaired, resulting in additional impairment charges.  "

.  Forward-Looking Information and Risk Factors
 That May Affect Future Results  From time to time, including in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our annual report to shareholders, we make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities LitigationReform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may relate to such matters as our business and marketing strategies, anticipated financial performance or business prospects in future periods, including with respect to our plannedcost savings initiatives, expected technological and product developments, the expected content of and timing for scheduled new product introductions or our expectations concerning the future acceptance of products by customers, the content andtiming of planned entertainment releases including motion pictures, television and digital content; and marketing and promotional efforts, research and development activities, liquidity, and similar matters. Forward-looking statements are inherentlysubject to risks and uncertainties. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. These statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such asanticipate, believe, could, expect, intend,   9 Table of Contentslooking forward, may, planned, potential, should, will and would or any variations of words with similarmeanings. We note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed or anticipated in our forward-looking statements. The factors listed beloware illustrative and other risks and uncertainties may arise as are or may be detailed from time to time in our public announcements and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K. We undertake noobligation to make any revisions to the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in our annual report to shareholders to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of the filing of this report. Unlessotherwise specifically indicated, all dollar or share amounts herein are expressed in millions of dollars or shares, except for per share amounts.  Our strategy involves focusing on franchise and key partner brands, and successfully developing those brands across the brand blueprint in a wide array of innovative toys and games,consumer products, storytelling and digital experiences. If we are not successful in developing and expanding these critical brands our business will suffer.  We have made a strategic decision to focus on fewer, larger global brands as we build our business. We are moving away from SKU making behaviors, which involve building a large number of products across manybrands, towards global brand building with an emphasis on developing our franchise and key partner brands, which we view as having the largest global potential. As we concentrate our efforts on a more select group of brands we can gainadditional leverage and enhance the consumer experience. But this focus also means that our future success depends disproportionately on our ability to successfully develop this select group of brands across our brand blueprint and to maintain andextend the reach and relevance of these brands to global consumers in a wide array of markets. This strategy has required us to build and develop competencies in new areas, including storytelling, digital content and consumer products.Developing and growing these competencies has required significant effort, time and money.  In 2016 revenues from our seven franchisebrands, LITTLEST PET SHOP, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, MONOPOLY, NERF, MY LITTLE PONY, PLAY-DOH and TRANSFORMERS, totaled 46% of our aggregate net revenues. Revenues from our key partner brands, including DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY FROZEN, MARVEL,STAR WARS, DREAMWORKS TROLLS and YO-KAI WATCH, constituted 28% of our aggregate net revenues in 2016. Together our franchise and partner brands account for the substantial majority of our revenues. If we are unable to successfully maintain anddevelop our franchise and key partner brands in the future, and grow sales of products based on those brands, our revenues and profits will decline and our business performance will suffer. In addition to continuing to grow and develop our existingfranchise brands, successfully executing our brand strategy requires us to successfully develop other brands, such as current emerging brands, and elevate them to franchise brand status over time. There is no guarantee that we will be able to dothis.  Consumer interests change rapidly, making it difficult to design and develop products which will bepopular with children and families, or to maintain the popularity of successful products.  The interests of children and familiesevolve extremely quickly and can change dramatically from year to year. To be successful we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment content, products and play patterns which will capture childrens and families interests andimagination and quickly develop and introduce innovative products which can compete successfully for consumers limited time, attention and spending. This challenge is more difficult with the ever increasing utilization of technology anddigital media in entertainment offerings, and the increasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers. Evolving consumer tastes and shifting interests, coupled with an ever changing and expanding pipeline of entertainment and consumerproperties and products which compete for childrens and families interest and acceptance, create an environment in which some products can fail to achieve consumer acceptance, and other products can be popular during a certain period oftime but then be rapidly replaced. As a result, individual childrens and family entertainment products and properties often have short consumer life cycles. If we devote time and resources to developing and marketing entertainment andproducts that consumers do not find interesting enough to buy in sufficient quantities to be profitable to us, our revenues and profits may decline and our business performance may be damaged. Similarly, if our product offerings and entertainmentfail to correctly anticipate consumer interests our revenues and earnings will be reduced.  Additionally, our business is increasinglyglobal and depends on interest in and acceptance of our childrens and family entertainment products and properties by consumers in diverse markets around the world with different tastes and preferences. As such, our success depends on ourability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences in multiple markets and geographies and to design product and entertainment offerings that can achieve popularity globally over a broad and diverse consumeraudience. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop and market products with global appeal.   10 Table of ContentsThe challenge of continuously developing and offering products that aresought after by children is compounded by the sophistication of todays children and the increasing array of technology and entertainment offerings available to them. Children are increasingly utilizing electronic offerings such as tablet devices and mobile phones and they are expanding their interests to a widerarray of innovative, technology-driven entertainment products and digital and social media offerings at younger and younger ages. Our products compete with the offerings of consumer electronics companies, digital media and social mediacompanies. To meet this challenge we, and our competitors, are designing and marketing products which incorporate increasing technology, seek to integrate digital and analog play, and aim to capitalize on new play patterns and increasedconsumption of digital and social media.  With the increasing array of competitive entertainment offerings, there is no guarantee that:     Any of our brands, products or product lines will achieve popularity or continue to be popular;     Any property for which we have a significant license will achieve or sustain popularity;     Any new products or product lines we introduce will be considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate market acceptance; or     Any products life cycle or sales quantities will be sufficient to permit us to profitably recover our development, manufacturing, marketing, royalties(including royalty advances and guarantees) and other costs of producing, marketing and selling the product.  Storytelling across media is an increasingly important factor for driving brand awareness and successfully building brands. Entertainment media, in forms such as television, motion pictures, digital content and other media, have become increasingly important platforms forconsumers to experience our brands and our partners brands and the success, or lack of success, of such media efforts can significantly impact the demand for our products and our financial performance. We spend considerable resources indesigning and developing products in conjunction with planned media releases, both by our partners and our own media releases. Not only our efforts, but the efforts of third parties, such as motion picture studios with whom we work, heavily impactthe timing of media development, release dates and the ultimate consumer interest in and success of these media efforts.  For 2017 we aredeveloping and marketing product lines tied to the scheduled motion picture releases by our key partners of DISNEYS BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, MARVELS GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2, SPIDERMAN: HOMECOMING, THOR:RAGNOROKand STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI. Those motion pictures are all being developed and released by our partners and our partners control the content and schedule for such motion pictures. Other key partner product lines we are offering, such asYO-KAI WATCH, depend on television support by our partners for their successes. Similarly, we are developing and marketing products for entertainment we play a more active role in developing or develop ourselves, such as TRANSFORMERS and MY LITTLEPONY. If those motion pictures, television shows, or any other key entertainment content for which we develop and market products are not as successful as we and our partners anticipate, the number of products we sell may decrease and harm ourbusiness.  The ultimate timing and success of such projects is critically dependent on the efforts and schedules of our licensors, andstudio and media partners. We do not fully control when or if any particular motion picture projects will be greenlit, developed or released, and our licensors or media partners may change their plans with respect to projects and release datesor cancel development all together. This can make it difficult for us to get feature films developed, plan future entertainment slates and to successfully develop and market products in conjunction with future motion picture and other mediareleases, given the lengthy lead times involved in product development and successful marketing efforts, and the fact that our third party partners may decide not to develop such entertainment. When we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases, those statements are based on our current plans and expectations.Unforeseen factors may increase the cost of these releases, delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation. Any delay or cancellation of planned product development work, introductions, or media support may decrease the number ofproducts we sell and harm our business.  Lack of sufficient consumer interest in entertainment media forwhich we offer products can harm our business.  Motion pictures, television, digital content or other media for which we developproducts may not be as popular with consumers as we anticipated. While it is difficult to anticipate what products may be sought after by   11 Table of Contentsconsumers, it can be even more difficult to properly predict the popularity of media efforts and properties given the broad array of competing offerings. If our and our partners mediaefforts fail to garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance, our revenues and the financial return from such efforts will be harmed.  Discovery Family Channel, our cable television joint venture with Discovery Communications, Inc. in the United States, competes with a number of other childrens television networks for viewers, advertisingrevenue and distribution fees. There is no guarantee that Discovery Family Channel will be successful. Similarly, Hasbro Studios programming distributed internationally and Backflip Studios digital products compete with content from manyother parties. Lack of consumer interest in and acceptance of content developed by Hasbro Studios and Backflip Studios, or other content appearing on Discovery Family Channel, and products related to that content, could significantly harm ourbusiness. Similarly, our business could be harmed by greater than expected costs, or unexpected delays or difficulties, associated with our investment in Discovery Family Channel, such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or inbuilding advertising revenues for Discovery Family Channel. During 2016 we spent $48.7 million for television programming and film projects being developed by Hasbro Studios and we anticipate that we will continue spending at comparable levelsin 2017 and future years.  At December 25, 2016, $242.4 million, or 4.8%, of our total assets, represented our investment in theDiscovery Family Channel. If the Discovery Family Channel is not successful our investments may become impaired, which could result in a write-down through net earnings.  The childrens and family entertainment industry and consumer products industry are highly competitive and the barriers to entry are low. If we are unable to competeeffectively with existing or new competitors or with our retailers private label toy products our revenues, market share and profitability could decline.  The childrens and family entertainment industry and the consumer products industry are, and will continue to be, highly competitive. We compete in the United States and internationally with a wide arrayof large and small manufacturers, marketers, and sellers of analog toys and games, digital gaming products, digital media, products which combine analog and digital play, and other entertainment and consumer products, as well as with retailers whooffer such products under their own private labels. In addition, we compete with other companies who are focused on building their brands across multiple product and consumer categories. Across our business, we face competitors who areconstantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends, seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase. In addition to existing competitors, the barriers to entry for new participants in the childrens and family entertainment industry and in theconsumer products industry are low, and the increasing importance of digital media, and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest, has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets, and hasbroadened the array of companies we compete with. New participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time.These existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences. Our competitors products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for ourproducts, lower our revenues and lower our profitability.  In recent years, retailers have also developed their own private-labelproducts that directly compete with the products of traditional manufacturers and brand owners. Some retail chains that are our customers sell private-label childrens and family entertainment products designed, manufactured and branded bythe retailers themselves. These products may be sold at prices lower than our prices for comparable products, which may result in lower purchases of our products by these retailers and may reduce our market share. An inability to develop and introduce planned products, product lines and new brands in a timely and cost-effectivemanner may damage our business.  In developing products, product lines and new brands, we have anticipated dates for theassociated product and brand introductions. When we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a particular product, product line or brand at a certain time in the future, those expectations are based on completing the associateddevelopment, implementation, and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule. There is no guarantee that we will be able to manufacture, source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on acost-effective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands. This risk is heightened by our customers compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business. The risk is also exacerbated by the increasingsophistication of many of the products we are designing, and brands we are   12 Table of Contentsdeveloping in terms of combining digital and analog technologies, utilizing digital media to a greater degree, and providing greater innovation and product differentiation. Unforeseen delaysor difficulties in the development process, significant increases in the planned cost of development, or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction date for products to be later thananticipated, may reduce or eliminate the profitability of such products or, in some situations, may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued.  Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance.  Our global operations mean we produce and buy products, and sell products, in many different markets with many different currencies. As a result, if the exchange rate between the United States dollar and alocal currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes, our financial results as reported in U.S. dollars, may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantlyaffected. As an example, if the dollar appreciates 10% relative to a local currency for an international market in which we had $200 million of net revenues, the dollar value of those sales, as they are translated into U.S. dollars, woulddecrease by $20 million in our consolidated financial results. As such, we would recognize a $20 million decrease in our net revenues, even if the actual level of sales in the foreign market had not changed. Similarly, our expenses can besignificantly impacted, in U.S. dollar terms, by exchange rates, meaning the profitability of our business in U.S. dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control. Late in 2014 and throughout2015, certain key currencies, such as the Euro, British pound sterling, Russian ruble, and Brazilian real depreciated significantly compared to the U.S. dollar. Also in 2016, certain of these key currencies depreciated against the U.S. dollar. Thisdepreciation had a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings. Depreciation in key currencies during 2017 and beyond may have a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings as they are reported in U.S. dollars. Global and regional economic downturns that negatively impact the retail and credit markets, or that otherwise damagethe financial health of our retail customers and consumers, can harm our business and financial performance.  We design,manufacture and market a wide variety of entertainment and consumer products worldwide through sales to our retail customers and directly to consumers. Our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending in themarkets in which we operate. Recessions, credit crises and other economic downturns, or disruptions in credit markets, in the United States and in other markets in which our products are marketed and sold can result in lower levels of economicactivity, lower employment levels, less consumer disposable income, and lower consumer confidence. Similarly, reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers, such as their homes or stock market investments, can lower consumer confidence andconsumer spending power. Any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products. This in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability. In addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our products during times of economic difficulty, in an effort to maintain sales duringsuch times we may need to reduce the price of our products, increase our promotional spending and/or sales allowances, or take other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products. Those steps may lower our net revenues orincrease our costs, thereby decreasing our operating margins and lowering our profitability.  An increasingportion of our business is expected to come from emerging markets, and growing business in emerging markets presents additional challenges.  We expect an increasing portion of our net revenues to come from emerging markets in the future, including Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia. In 2016 revenues in emerging markets constituted approximately 14%of our net revenues, up from only 6% of our net revenues in 2010. Over time, we expect our emerging market net revenues to continue to grow both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall business as one of our key business strategiesis to increase our presence in emerging and underserved international markets. Operating in an increasing number of markets, each with its own unique consumer preferences and business climates, presents additional challenges that we mustmeet. In addition to the need to successfully anticipate and serve different global consumer preferences and interests, sales and operations in emerging markets that we have entered, may enter, or may increase our presence in, are subject toother risks associated with international operations, including:      Complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies and the evolution of laws andregulations that impact our product offerings and related enforcement;   13 Table of Contents   Potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross border transactions;     Difficulties understanding the retail climate, consumer trends, local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be quite different from theUnited States;      Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another, including port congestion, strikes and other transportation delays and interruptions;and      The imposition of tariffs, border adjustment taxes, quotas, or other protectionist measures. Because of the importance of our emerging market net revenues, our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if any of the risksdescribed above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our emerging market business. Our business depends in large part on the success of our key partner brands and on our ability to maintain and extendsolid relationships with our key partners.  As part of our strategy, in addition to developing and marketing products based onproperties we own or control, we also seek to obtain licenses enabling us to develop and market products based on popular entertainment properties owned by third parties.  We currently have in-licenses to several successful entertainment properties, including MARVEL and STAR WARS, as well as DISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY FROZEN. These licenses typically have multi-year terms andprovide us with the right to market and sell designated classes of products. In recent years our sales of products under the MARVEL and STAR WARS licenses have been highly significant to our business. In 2016 we began sales of products based onDISNEY PRINCESS and DISNEY FROZEN, which contributed significantly to our performance. If we fail to meet our contractual commitments and/or any of these licenses were to terminate and not be renewed, or the popularity of any of these licensedproperties was to significantly decline, our business would be damaged and we would need to successfully develop and market other products to replace the products previously offered under license. Our license to the MARVEL property is granted from Marvel Entertainment, LLC and Marvel Characters B.V. (together Marvel). Ourlicense to the STAR WARS property is granted by Lucas Licensing Ltd. and Lucasfilm Ltd. (together Lucas). Both Marvel and Lucas are owned by The Walt Disney Company. Our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend, in large part, on our sales duringthe relatively brief holiday shopping season. This seasonality is exacerbated by retailers quick response inventory management techniques.  Sales of our toys, games and other family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from September through December in anticipation of theholiday season. This seasonality has increased over time, as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques. Customers are timing their orders so that they are being filledby suppliers, such as us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. For toys, games and other family entertainment products which we produce, a majority of retail sales for the entire year generally occur in the fourth quarter, close to theholiday season. As a consequence, the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from September through December, as our customers do not want to maintain large on-hand inventories throughout the year ahead of consumer demand. Whilethese techniques reduce a retailers investment in inventory, they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier. The level of inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us. If we or our customersdetermine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional products to fully meet consumer demand. Additionally, the logistics of supplying moreand more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance. This seasonal pattern requires significant useof working capital, mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales ofpopular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers. Our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand, resulting in our under producing popular items and/or overproducing less popularitems, would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations. In addition, as a result of the seasonal nature   14 Table of Contentsof our business, we would be significantly and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year, by unforeseen eventssuch as a terrorist attack or economic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods, particularly from the FarEast, during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season.  The concentration of ourretail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us. We depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products. For the fiscal year ended December 25, 2016,Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Toys R Us, Inc. and Target Corporation, accounted for approximately 18%, 9% and 9%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers, including Wal-Mart, Toys R Us andTarget, in the aggregate accounted for approximately 41% of our consolidated net revenues. In the U.S. and Canada segment, approximately 62% of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers. If one or more ofour major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing business with us, significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us, favor competitors or new entrants, increase their direct competitionwith us by expanding their private-label business, change their purchasing patterns, alter the manner in which they promote our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products, or return substantial amounts of ourproducts, it could significantly harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. Customers make no binding long-term commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders. Any customer couldreduce its overall purchase of our products, and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products. In addition, increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impactour ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers. Furthermore, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of oneor more of our significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and profitability.  Partof our strategy to remain relevant to children and families is to offer innovative products incorporating progressive technology, integrating digital and analog play. These products can be more difficult and expensive to design and manufacture whichmay reduce margins on some or a portion of these products compared to more traditional toys and games and such products may have short life spans.  As childhood evolves and children become more interested in sophisticated product offerings, such as video games, consumer electronics and social and digital media, at younger and younger ages, we have sought tokeep our products relevant and interesting for these consumers. To continue capturing the interest of sophisticated youth, we must offer innovative childrens electronic toy and game products. This is another key to our strategy; complementinganalog play with digital integration and investing in technology development. These electronic and digital products, if successful, can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase our sales. However, childrens electronicand digital products, in addition to the risks associated with our other family entertainment products, also face certain additional risks.  Costs associated with designing, developing and producing technologically advanced or sophisticated products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products, such as board games and actionfigures. The ability to sell enough of these advanced products, at prices high enough to recoup our costs and make a profit, is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment products, and can be further constrained bydifficult economic conditions. As a result, we can face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs and we may lose money on the development and sale of these products. Additionally, designing, developing and producingtechnologically advanced or sophisticated products requires different competencies and follows different timelines than traditional toys and games. Delays in the design, development or production of these products incorporated into orassociated with traditional toys and games could have a significant impact on our ability to successfully offer such products. In addition, the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics and digital gaming areasis potentially even greater than for our other products. This pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games. Our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the United States subject us to risks associated withinternational operations.  We operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the United States. For the yearended December 25, 2016, our net revenues from the International segment comprised approximately 44% of our total   15 Table of Contentsconsolidated net revenues. We expect net revenues from our International segment to continue accounting for a significant portion of our revenues. In fact, over time, we expect our internationalsales and operations to continue to grow both in dollars and as a percentage of our overall business as a result of a key business strategy to expand our presence in emerging and underserved international markets. Additionally, as we discuss below,we utilize third-party manufacturers located in the Far East to produce most of our products. These international sales and manufacturing operations, including operations in emerging markets, are subject to risks that may significantly harm oursales, increase our costs or otherwise damage our business, including:      Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;      Limitations on the repatriation of earnings;      Potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross border transactions, which can materially increase our taxes and othercosts of doing business;      Political instability, civil unrest and economic instability;      Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;     Complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies and the evolution of laws andregulations and related enforcement;      Difficulties understanding the retail climate, consumer trends, local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be quite different from theUnited States;      Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and cost in recovering therefrom;     Transportation delays and interruptions;      Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another, including port congestion, strikes and other transportation delays and interruptions;     Increased investment and operational complexity to make our products compatible with systems in various countries and compliant with local laws;     Changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing business internationally; and     The imposition of tariffs, quotas, border adjustment taxes (such as is currently being discussed in the United States) or other protectionist measures by anymajor country or market in which we operate, which could make it significantly more expensive and difficult to import products into that country or market, raise the cost of such products, decrease our sales of such products and/or decrease ourprofitability.  On June 23rd 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) voted in a referendum to leave the European Union (EU), commonly referredto as Brexit. The UK government has stated it will begin the formal two-year period to negotiate the terms of the UKs exit and future relationship with the EU by April 2017. The terms of this future relationship are uncertain but the UKgovernment has confirmed its intention to remove the UK from the EU single market and implement additional controls on the movement of people from within the EU. The Brexit vote resulted in a weakening of the British pound sterling against the USdollar and increased volatility in the foreign currency markets, notably the Euro. These fluctuations have adversely affected our final results for 2016, although the impact has been partially mitigated by our hedging strategy. Our revenues inEurope are predominately denominated in local currency. Hasbro will continue to closely monitor the Brexit negotiations and the foreign currency markets, but changes in foreign exchange rates and other potential regulations and increased costsassociated with Brexit may harm our sales and the profitability of our business in the UK and the EU.  Because of the importance ofinternational sales, sourcing and manufacturing to our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing ourincreasing global business.  Other economic and public health conditions in the markets in which weoperate, including rising commodity and fuel prices, higher labor costs, increased transportation costs, outbreaks of public health pandemics or other diseases, or third party conduct could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship ourproducts, and lower our revenues, margins and profitability.  Various economic and public health conditions can impact ourability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and cost-effective manner, or can otherwise have a significant negative impact on our revenues, profitability and business.   16 Table of ContentsSignificant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers, such asgasoline, home heating fuels, or groceries, may reduce household spending on the discretionary branded-play entertainment products we offer. As we discussed above, weakened economic conditions, lowered employment levels or recessions in any of ourmajor markets may significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products. Economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks, wars and other conflicts, natural disasters, increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs,or the prospect of such events. Such a weakened economic and business climate, as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate, could harm our revenues and profitability. Our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products, but also on our ability to produce and sell those products atcosts which allow for us to make a profit. Rising fuel and raw material prices, for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components, increased transportation costs, and increased labor costs in the markets inwhich our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products, which in turn may reduce our margins, reduce our profitability and harm our business. Other conditions, such as the unavailability of sufficient quantities of electrical components, may impede our ability to manufacture, source andship new and continuing products on a timely basis. Additional factors outside of our control could further delay our products or increase the cost we pay to produce such products. For example, work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, an outbreak of asevere public health pandemic, a natural disaster or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts, all could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product. Any of these factors could result in product delays, increased costs and/orlost sales for our products.  We may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed materialhas less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties.  In addition to designing and developing products based on our own brands, we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests by producing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by thirdparties and licensed to us. The success of entertainment properties for which we have a license, such as MARVEL, STAR WARS, SESAME STREET, DISNEY PRINCESS, DISNEY FROZEN, DREAMWORKS TROLLS, YO-KAI WATCH or BEYBLADE related products, cansignificantly affect our revenues and profitability. If we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series, the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we areoffering. In addition, competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure, maintain, and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms, if at all, and to attract and retain thetalented employees necessary to design, develop and market successful products based on these properties.  The license agreements weenter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial, and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales, which could result in write-offs of significantamounts which in turn would harm our results of operations. At December 25, 2016, we had $102.8 million of prepaid royalties, $34.1 million of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $68.7 million of which areincluded in other assets. Under the terms of existing contracts as of December 25, 2016, we may be required to pay additional future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately $355.7 million. Acquiring orrenewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable, which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal, or missing businessopportunities for new licenses. Additionally, as a licensee of entertainment-based properties we have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy, game or other family entertainment products, andunderperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us.  We anticipate that the shortertheatrical duration for movie releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize theirinventory risk. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future, as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introducedto the market. In the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainment licenses on advantageous terms, our revenues and profits may be harmed.   17 Table of ContentsOur use of third-party manufacturers to produce our products, as well ascertain other products, presents risks to our business.  With the sale of our remaining manufacturing facilities in 2015, all ofour products are now manufactured by third-party manufacturers, the majority of which are located in China. Should changes be necessary, our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted, over a significant period of time, to alternative sourcesof supply. If we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political, civil, labor or other factors beyond our control, including natural disasters or pandemics, our operationsmay be substantially disrupted, potentially for a significant period of time. This delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business while alternative sources of supply are secured. Given that our toy manufacturing is conducted by third-party manufacturers, the majority of whom are located in China, health conditions and otherfactors affecting social and economic activity in China and affecting the movement of people and products into and from China to our major markets, including North America and Europe, as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs ofdoing business in China, could have a significant negative impact on our operations, revenues and earnings.  Factors that couldnegatively affect our business include a potential significant revaluation of the Chinese Yuan, which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products in China, labor shortages and increases in labor costs in China as well as difficultiesin moving products manufactured in China out of Asia and through the ports in North America and Europe, whether due to port congestion, labor disputes, slow-downs, product regulations and/or inspections or other factors. Prolonged disputes orslowdowns at the west coast port can negatively impact both the time and cost of transporting goods into the United States. Natural disasters or health pandemics impacting China can also have a significant negative impact on our business. Further, the imposition of tariffs, quotas, border adjustment taxes (such as is currently being discussed in the United States), tradesanctions or other protectionist regulations or economic penalties by the United States or the European Union against products imported by us from China or other foreign countries, or the loss of normal trade relations status with Chinaor other foreign countries in which we operate, could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the United States or Europe, decrease our sales of such products, and/or decrease our profitability, and harm our business. Additionally,the suspension of the operations of a third-party manufacturer by government inspectors in China or another market in which we source products could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales. We require our third-party manufacturers to comply with our Global Business Ethics Principles, which are designed to prevent products manufacturedfor us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions. Our Global Business Ethics Principles address a number of issues, including working hours and compensation, health and safety, and abuse and discrimination. In addition, we requirethat our products supplied by third-party manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including consumer and product safety laws in the markets where those products are sold. Hasbro has the right and exercisessuch right, both directly and through the use of outside monitors, to monitor compliance by our third-party manufacturers with our Global Business Ethics Principles and other manufacturing requirements. In addition, we do quality assurance testingon our products, including products manufactured for us by third parties. Notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them, there is always a risk that one or more of our third-party manufacturers will notcomply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such non-compliance. Any failure of our third-party manufacturers to comply with labor, consumer, product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for uscould result in damage to our reputation, harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the evolution of gaming, our revenues and profitability may decline. Recognizing the critical need for increased innovation and a change in the way we go to market with gaming products in order toremain successful in the gaming business in the future, we began implementing a strategy in 2011 to reinvent our gaming business. The objective of this plan was to stabilize our gaming business in 2012, and to position it to grow over thelong-term. Our strategy to drive our gaming business in the future involves substantial changes in how we market our gaming products to consumers and how we position them at retail, a focus on understanding consumer insights and in deliveringindustry leading innovation in gaming, a change in our allocation of focus across gaming brands, greater penetration of our brands into digital gaming and the successful combination of analog and digital gaming. Our strategy also involvesmaking changes in how we design and develop our gaming products. We recognize the need to provide immersive game play that is easy for consumers to learn and play in shorter periods of time, as well as offer innovative face to face, off theboard and digital gaming   18 Table of Contentsopportunities. People are gaming in greater numbers than ever before, but the nature of gaming has and continues to evolve quickly. To be successful our gaming offerings must evolve toanticipate and meet these changes in consumer gaming. Our failure to successfully implement our strategy and to keep up with the evolution of gaming could substantially harm our business, resulting in lost revenues and lost profits. Our success is critically dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees. Our officers and employees are at the heart of all of our efforts. It is their skill, innovation and hard work that drive oursuccess. We compete with many other potential employers in recruiting, hiring and retaining our senior management team and our many other skilled officers and other employees around the world. There is no guarantee that we will be able to recruit,hire or retain the senior management, officers and other employees we need to succeed. Additionally, we have experienced significant changes in our workforce from our restructuring efforts and the recruitment and hiring of new skill sets requiredfor our changing global business. We have added hundreds of employees in our global markets, in licensing and in entertainment and storytelling capabilities, while reducing our workforce in other areas over the last several years. Thesechanges in employee composition, both in terms of global distribution and in skill sets, have required changes in our business. Our loss of key management or other employees, or our inability to hire talented people with the skill sets we needfor our changing business, could significantly harm our business.  To remain competitive we mustcontinuously work to increase efficiency and reduce costs, but there is no guarantee we will be successful in this regard.  Ourbusiness is extremely competitive, the pace of change in our industry is getting faster and our competitors are always working to be more efficient and profitable. To compete we must continuously improve our processes, increase efficiency andwork to reduce our expenses. We intend to achieve this partly by focusing on fewer, more global brand initiatives and through process improvements, including in global product development. However, these actions are no guarantee we willachieve our cost savings goal and we may realize fewer benefits than are expected from this initiative. Our business is critically dependent on our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rightssuccessfully.  Our intellectual property, including our trademarks and tradenames, copyrights, patents, and rights under ourlicense agreements and other agreements that establish our intellectual property rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, is of critical value. We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, patent andother proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands in the United States and around the world. From time to time, third parties have challenged, and may in the future try to challenge, ourownership of our intellectual property in the United States and around the world. In addition, our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights. We may need to resortto litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. Similarly, third parties may claim ownership over certain aspects of our products or other intellectual property. Ourfailure to successfully protect our intellectual property rights could significantly harm our business and competitive position.  We have a material amount of acquired product rights which, if impaired, would result in a reduction of our net earnings. Much of our intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our consolidated balance sheets. However, as ofDecember 25, 2016, we had $245.9 million of acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed products or our decision to reduceour focus or exit these brands may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge. Reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results. We rely on external financing, including our credit facility, to help fund our operations. If we wereunable to obtain or service such financing, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome, our business would be harmed.  Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our working capital needs, particularly those in the third and fourth quarters, we rely on our commercial paper program, revolving credit facility andour other credit facilities for working capital. We currently have a commercial paper program which, subject to market conditions,   19 Table of Contentsand availability under our committed revolving credit facility, allows us to issue up to $700.0 million in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a source ofworking capital funding and liquidity. There is no guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms, or at all, at any given point in time.  We also have a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2020, which provides for a $700.0 million committed revolving credit facility and a further source of working capital funding and liquidity. This facilityalso supports borrowings under our commercial paper program. The credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility. Theserestrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial, operating and strategic flexibility. In addition, our financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility. Our performance and financial conditionmay not meet our original expectations, causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants. Non-compliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines, acircumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations. Not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sourcesof external financing, but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing. In times of severe economic downturn and/or distress in the credit markets, it is possible that one or more sources ofexternal financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us. In such a situation, it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities, and it might not be possible to find alternative sources offunding.  We also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to time, through the issuance of debt securities. Our ability toissue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interest rates, and the overall condition of the financial andcredit markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Variations in these factors could make it difficultfor us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities. The failure to receive financing on desirable terms, or at all, could damage our ability to support our future operations or capitalneeds or engage in other business activities.  As of December 25, 2016, we had $1,559.9 million of total principal amount oflong-term debt outstanding, including the current portion. If we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default. There is no guarantee that we would be ableto refinance debt on favorable terms, or at all.  As a manufacturer of consumer products and a largemultinational corporation, we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future, violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business. In addition, we could be thesubject of future product liability suits or product recalls, which could harm our business.  As a manufacturer of consumerproducts, we are subject to significant government regulations, including, in the United States, under The Consumer Products Safety Act, The Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and The Flammable Fabrics Act, as well as under product safety andconsumer protection statutes in our international markets. In addition, certain of our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration or similar international authorities. In addition, advertising to children is subject toregulation by the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and a host of other agencies globally, and the collection of information from children under the age of thirteen is subject to the provisions of the ChildrensOnline Privacy Protection Act and other privacy laws around the world. While we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance and failure to comply with these actscould result in sanctions which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall. While costs associatedwith product recalls have generally not been material to our business, the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant. In addition, any product recall, regardless ofdirect costs of the recall, may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations.  Governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future and may also increase thepenalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations. In addition, one or more of our customers might require changes in our products, such as the non-use of certain materials, in the future.  20 Table of ContentsComplying with any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business. Similarly, increased penalties for non-compliance could subject us to greater expensein the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations. Such increased costs or penalties could harm our business.  As a large, multinational corporation, we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world, including antitrust, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, environmentalregulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetaryliabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition.  We may notrealize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures, or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization.  Acquisitions and investments have been a component of our growth and the development of our business, and that is likely to continue in the future. Acquisitions can broaden and diversify our brand holdings andproduct offerings, and allow us to build additional capabilities and competencies around our brand blueprint including in storytelling and digital media. In reviewing potential acquisitions or investments, we target companies that we believe offerattractive family entertainment products or offerings, the ability for us to leverage our family play and entertainment offerings, opportunities to drive our strategic brand blueprint and associated competencies, or other synergies. In the case ofour joint venture with Discovery, we looked to partner with a company that has shown the ability to establish and operate compelling entertainment channels. Additionally, through our acquisition of Backflip Studios, we looked to strengthen ourmobile gaming expertise. However, we cannot be certain that the products and offerings of companies we may acquire, or acquire an interest in, will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companiesor investments will allow us to more effectively market our products, develop our competencies or to grow our business.  In some cases,we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production, marketing and other operating synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and, where applicable, cost savings,operating efficiencies and other advantages. However, we cannot be certain that these synergies, efficiencies and cost savings will be realized. Even if achieved, these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization. In other cases, we mayacquire or invest in companies that we believe have strong and creative management, in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations. We cannot be certain that the key talentedindividuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products, entertainment or services in the future. There is no guarantee that any acquisition or investment we maymake will be successful or beneficial, and acquisitions can consume significant amounts of management attention and other resources, which may negatively impact other aspects of our business. Failure to successfully operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt ourbusiness or reduce our sales or profitability.  We rely extensively on various information technology systems and softwareapplications to manage many aspects of our business, including product development, management of our supply chain, sale and delivery of our products, financial reporting and various other processes and transactions. We are critically dependenton the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems and related back-up systems. These systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, malware andother security breaches, catastrophic events such as hurricanes, fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees. The efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends on theseinformation systems, including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully. The failure of our information systemsto perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business, require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability. If our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed. We maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world. This data relates to all aspects of our business,including current and future products and entertainment under development, and also contains certain customer, consumer, supplier, partner and employee data. We maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data, but notwithstandingsuch protective measures, there is a risk of intrusion or   21 Table of Contentstampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data. In addition, we provide confidential and proprietary information to our third-party business partners in certain caseswhere doing so is necessary to conduct our business. While we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data, and where applicable, that they will take steps to assure the protections ofsuch data by third parties, nonetheless those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of such data. Any compromise of the confidential data of our customers, consumers, suppliers, partners, employees orourselves, or failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of or damage to this data through breach of our information technology systems or other means could substantially disrupt our operations, harm our customers, consumers and other businesspartners, damage our reputation, violate applicable laws and regulations and subject us to additional costs and liabilities and loss of business that could be material.  From time to time, we are involved in litigation, arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense. As a large multinational corporation, we are subject, from time to time, to regulatory investigations, litigation and arbitration disputes,including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of products that have been or may be developed by us as well as claims by third parties that our products infringe upon or misuse such third partiesproperty or rights. Because the outcome of litigation, arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant cost for us and harm our business.The fact that we operate in significant numbers of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements. Any successfulclaim against us could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in, or differing interpretations of, income tax laws and rules, and changes in our geographic operatingresults, may impact our effective tax rate.  We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in various international taxjurisdictions. We also conduct business activities between our operating units in various jurisdictions and we are subject to transfer pricing rules in the countries in which we operate. There is some degree of uncertainty and subjectivityin complying with transfer pricing rules. Our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in, or the interpretation of, tax laws or by changes in the amount of revenue and earnings we derive, or are determined to derive by tax authorities,from jurisdictions with differing tax rates. Unanticipated changes in our tax rate could impact our results of operations. In addition, we may be subject to tax examinations by federal, state, and international jurisdictions, and theseexaminations can result in significant tax findings if the tax authorities interpret the application of laws and rules differently than we do or disagree with the intercompany rates we are applying. We assess the likelihood of outcomesresulting from tax uncertainties. At December 25, 2016 we have a liability for uncertain tax benefits of $84.4 million. While we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome of these uncertain tax benefits, or results ofpossible current or future tax examinations, may differ from our estimates and may have a significant adverse impact on our business and operating results.  We have a material amount of goodwill which, if it becomes impaired, would result in a reduction in our net earnings. Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire. Goodwill is not amortized and isrequired to be periodically evaluated for impairment. At December 25, 2016, $570.6 million, or 11.2%, of our total assets represented goodwill. Declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units, which could resultin a write-down of our goodwill and consequently harm our results of operations. During the fourth quarter of 2016, in conjunction with the Companys annual review for impairment, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $32.9, million or$0.12 per diluted share, related to our Backflip reporting unit, reducing goodwill to $86.3 million. In the future, should Backflip not achieve its profitability and growth targets, including anticipated game releases in 2017 and beyond, thecarrying value may become further impaired, resulting in additional impairment charges.   "

 That May Affect Future Results  From time to time, including in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our annual report to shareholders, we publish forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private SecuritiesLitigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may relate to such matters as our business and marketing strategies, anticipated financial performance or business prospects in future periods, including with respect to ourplanned cost savings initiative, expected technological and product developments, the expected content of and timing for scheduled new product introductions or our expectations concerning the future acceptance of products by customers, the contentand timing of planned entertainment releases including motion pictures, television and digital products; and marketing and promotional efforts, research and development activities, liquidity, and  10 Table of Contentssimilar matters. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-lookingstatements. These statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as anticipate, believe, could, expect, intend, looking forward,may, planned, potential, should, will and would or any variations of words with similar meanings. We note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experienceto differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed or anticipated in our forward-looking statements. The factors listed below are illustrative and other risks and uncertainties may arise as are or may be detailed fromtime to time in our public announcements and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K. We undertake no obligation to make any revisions to the forward-looking statements contained in this AnnualReport on Form 10-K or in our annual report to shareholders to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of the filing of this report. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all dollar or share amounts herein are expressed inmillions of dollars or shares, except for per share amounts.  We are focusing our global efforts aroundour brand architecture, which includes a heightened emphasis and reliance on our franchise and key partner brands, and development of those brands across the brand blueprint. We have made a strategic decision to focus on fewer, larger global brands as we build our business. We are moving away from SKU makingbehaviors, which involve building a large number of products across many brands, towards global brand building with an emphasis on developing our franchise and key partner brands, which we view as having the largest global potential. As weconcentrate our efforts on a more select group of brands, our future success depends to a greater extent on our ability to successfully develop those brands across our brand blueprint and to maintain and extend the reach and relevance of thosebrands to global consumers in a wide array of markets. This strategy has required us to build and develop competencies in new areas, including storytelling, digital content and consumer products. Developing and growing these competencies hasrequired significant effort, time and money. Our future success is dependent on our ability to continue building our brands across the blueprint.  In 2015 revenues from our seven franchise brands, LITTLEST PET SHOP, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, MONOPOLY, NERF, MY LITTLE PONY, PLAY-DOH and TRANSFORMERS, totaled 52% of our aggregate net revenues. Our keypartner brands, including DISNEY, MARVEL and LUCASFILM, also constitute a significant portion of our overall business. In 2015, net revenues from our partner brands constituted 28% of our aggregate net revenues. Together our franchise and partnerbrands are critical to our business. If we are unable to successfully execute this strategy and to maintain and develop our franchise and key partner brands in the future, such that our product offerings based on these brands are not sought after byconsumers to the extent required to maintain and grow those brands, our revenues and profits will decline and our business performance will be harmed. In addition to continuing to grow and develop our existing franchise brands, successfullyexecuting our brand strategy may also require us to be able to successfully develop other brands, such as current challenger brands, to franchise brand status. There is no guarantee that we will be able to do this. Consumer interests change rapidly, making it difficult to design and develop products which will be popular withchildren and families.  The interests of children and families evolve extremely quickly and can change dramaticallyfrom year to year. To be successful we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment content, products and play patterns which will capture childrens and families interests and imagination and quickly develop and introduceinnovative products which can compete successfully for consumers limited time, attention and spending. This challenge is more difficult with the ever increasing utilization of technology and digital media in entertainment offerings, and theincreasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers. Evolving consumer tastes and shifting interests, coupled with an ever changing and expanding pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for childrensand families interest and acceptance, create an environment in which some products can fail to achieve consumer acceptance, and other products can be popular   11 Table of Contentsduring a certain period of time but then be rapidly replaced. As a result, individual childrens and family entertainment products and properties often have short consumer life cycles. If wedevote time and resources to developing entertainment and products that consumers do not find interesting enough to buy in significant quantities to be profitable to us, our revenues and profits may decline and our business performance may bedamaged. Similarly, if our product offerings and entertainment fail to correctly anticipate consumer interests our revenues and earnings will be reduced.  Additionally, our business is increasingly global and depends on interest in and acceptance of our childrens and family entertainment products and properties by consumers in diverse markets aroundthe world with different tastes and preferences. As such, our success depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences in multiple markets and geographies and to design product and entertainmentofferings that can achieve popularity globally over a broad and diverse consumer audience.  Thechallenge of continuously developing and offering products that are sought after by children is compounded by the sophistication of todays children and the increasing array of technology and entertainment offerings available to them. Children are increasingly utilizing electronic offerings such as tablet devices and mobile phones and they areexpanding their interests to a wider array of innovative, technology-driven entertainment products and digital and social media offerings at younger and younger ages. Our products compete with the offerings of consumer electronics companies, digitalmedia and social media companies. To meet this challenge we, and our competitors, are designing and marketing products which incorporate increasing technology, seek to integrate digital and analog play, and aim to capitalize on new play patterns andincreased consumption of digital and social media.  With the increasing array of competitive entertainment offerings, there isno guarantee that:      Any of our brands, products or product lines will achieve popularity or continue to be popular;     Any property for which we have a significant license will achieve or sustain popularity;     Any new products or product lines we introduce will be considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate market acceptance; or     Any products life cycle or sales quantities will be sufficient to permit us to profitably recover our development, manufacturing, marketing,royalties (including royalty advances and guarantees) and other costs of producing, marketing and selling the product.  Entertainment is an increasingly important success factor for our brand awareness, storytelling and brand building. Entertainment media, in forms such as television, motion pictures, digital products, digital shorts, DVD releases and other media, havebecome increasingly important platforms for consumers to experience our brands and our partners brands and the success, or lack of success, of such media efforts can significantly impact the demand for our products and our financial success.We spend considerable resources in designing and developing products in conjunction with planned media releases, both by our partners and our own media releases. Not only our efforts, but the efforts of third parties, heavily impact the timing ofmedia development, release dates and the ultimate consumer interest in and success of these media efforts.  For 2016 we aredeveloping and marketing significant product lines tied to the scheduled motion picture releases by key partners of CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR, MOANA, ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY and TROLLS. Those motion pictures are all beingdeveloped and released by our partners and our partners control the content and schedule for such motion pictures. Other key partner product lines we are offering, such as YOKAI-WATCH, depend on television support by our partners for theirsuccesses. Similarly, we are developing and marketing products for entertainment we play a more active role in developing or develop ourselves. If those motion pictures, television shows, or any other key entertainment content for which we developand market products are not as successful as we and our partners anticipate, our revenues and earnings will be reduced.   12 Table of ContentsThe ultimate timing and success of such projects is critically dependent on the efforts andschedules of our licensors, and studio and media partners. We do not fully control when or if any particular motion picture projects will be greenlit, developed or released, and our licensors or media partners may change their plans with respect toprojects and release dates or cancel development all together. This can make it difficult for us to get feature films developed, plan future entertainment slates and to successfully develop and market products in conjunction with future motionpicture and other media releases, given the lengthy lead times involved in product development and successful marketing efforts. When we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases, those statements are based on our current plans andexpectations. Unforeseen factors may increase the cost of these releases, delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation. Any delay or cancellation of planned product development work, introductions, or media support may decrease thenumber of products we sell and harm our business.  Lack of sufficient consumer interest in entertainmentmedia for which we offer products can harm our business.  Motion pictures, television, digital products or other mediafor which we develop products may not be as popular with consumers as we anticipated. While it is difficult to anticipate what products may be sought after by consumers, it can be even more difficult to properly predict the popularity of mediaefforts and properties given the broad array of competing offerings. If our and our partners media efforts fail to garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance, our revenues and the financial return from such efforts will be harmed. Discovery Family Channel, our cable television joint venture with Discovery Communications, Inc. in the United States,competes with a number of other childrens television networks for viewers, advertising revenue and distribution fees. There is no guarantee that Discovery Family Channel will be successful. Similarly, Hasbro Studios programmingdistributed internationally and Backflip Studios digital products compete with content from many other parties. Lack of consumer interest in and acceptance of content developed by Hasbro Studios and Backflip Studios, or other content appearingon Discovery Family Channel, and products related to that content, could significantly harm our business. Similarly, our business could be harmed by greater than expected costs, or unexpected delays or difficulties, associated with our investment inDiscovery Family Channel, such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or in building advertising revenues for Discovery Family Channel. During 2015 we spent $42.5 million for television programming and film projects being developedby Hasbro Studios and we anticipate that we will continue spending at comparable levels in 2016 and future years.  AtDecember 27, 2015, $242.9 million, or 5.1%, of our total assets, represented our investment in Discovery Family Channel. If Discovery Family Channel does not achieve success, or if there are subsequent declines in the success or profitabilityof the channel, then our investment may become impaired, which could result in a write-down through net earnings.  The childrens and family entertainment industry and consumer products industry are highly competitive and the barriers to entry are low. If we are unable to compete effectivelywith existing or new competitors or with our retailers private label toy products our revenues, market share and profitability could decline.  The childrens and family entertainment industry and the consumer products industry are, and will continue to be, highly competitive. We compete in the United States and internationally with a widearray of large and small manufacturers, marketers, and sellers of analog toys and games, digital gaming products, digital media, products which combine analog and digital play, and other entertainment and consumer products, as well as with retailerswho offer such products under their own private labels. In addition, we compete with other companies who are focused on building their brands across multiple product and consumer categories. Across our business, we face competitors who areconstantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends, seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase. In addition to existing competitors, the barriers to entry for new participants in the childrens and family entertainment industryand in the consumer products industry are low, and the increasing importance of digital   13 Table of Contentsmedia, and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest, has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets, and has broadened the array ofcompanies we compete with. New participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time. These existing and newcompetitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences. Our competitors products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products, lower our revenues andlower our profitability.  In recent years, retailers have also developed their own private-label products that directly competewith the products of traditional manufacturers and brand owners. Some retail chains that are our customers sell private-label childrens and family entertainment products designed, manufactured and branded by the retailers themselves. Theseproducts may be sold at prices lower than our prices for comparable products, which may result in lower purchases of our products by these retailers and may reduce our market share. An inability to develop and introduce planned products, product lines and new brands in a timely and cost-effectivemanner may damage our business.  In developing products, product lines and new brands we have anticipated dates for theassociated product and brand introductions. When we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a particular product, product line or brand at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associateddevelopment, implementation, and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule. There is no guarantee that we will be able to manufacture, source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on acost-effective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands. This risk is heightened by our customers compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business. The risk is also exacerbated by the increasing sophistication ofmany of the products we are designing, and brands we are developing in terms of combining digital and analog technologies, utilizing digital media to a greater degree, and providing greater innovation and product differentiation. Unforeseen delaysor difficulties in the development process, significant increases in the planned cost of development, or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipatedor, in some situations, may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued.  Changes inforeign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance.  Our global operationsmean we produce and buy products, and sell products, in many different jurisdictions with many different currencies. As a result, if the exchange rate between the United States dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we havesignificant sales or operations changes, our financial results as reported in U.S. dollars, may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected. As an example, if the dollar appreciates 10% relativeto a local currency for an international market in which we had $200 million of net revenues, the dollar value of those sales, as they are translated into U.S. dollars, would decrease by $20 million in our consolidated financial results. As such, wewould recognize a $20 million decrease in our net revenues, even if the actual level of sales in the foreign market had not changed. Similarly, our expenses can be significantly impacted, in U.S. dollar terms, by exchange rates, meaning theprofitability of our business in U.S. dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control. Late in 2014 and throughout 2015, certain key currencies, such as the Euro, Russian Ruble, and Brazilian Realdepreciated significantly compared to the U.S. dollar. This depreciation had a significant negative impact on our 2014 and 2015 revenues and earnings. Similar depreciation in key currencies during 2016 may have a significant negative impact on ourrevenues and earnings as they are reported in U.S. dollars.  Global and regional economic downturns thatnegatively impact the retail and credit markets, or that otherwise damage the financial health of our retail customers and consumers, can harm our business and financial performance. We design, manufacture and market a wide variety of entertainment and consumer products worldwide through sales to our retail customersand directly to consumers. Our financial performance is impacted by the   14 Table of Contentslevel of discretionary consumer spending in the markets in which we operate. Recessions, credit crises and other economic downturns, or disruptions in credit markets, in the United States and inother markets in which our products are marketed and sold can result in lower levels of economic activity, lower employment levels, less consumer disposable income, and lower consumer confidence. Similarly, reductions in the value of key assets heldby consumers, such as their homes or stock market investments, can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power. Any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products. This in turn can reduce ourrevenues and harm our financial performance and profitability.  In addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from ourproducts during times of economic difficulty, in an effort to maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price of our products, increase our promotional spending and/or sales allowances, or take other steps to encourage retailer andconsumer purchase of our products. Those steps may lower our net revenues or increase our costs, thereby decreasing our operating margins and lowering our profitability.  Challenging market conditions in certain developed economies, such as in Australia and certain Western European countries, make it more difficult for us to succeed. Our future success in developed economies is impacted by market conditions. For example, a European sovereign debtcrisis or other significant negative shock to European markets could lead to a recession in Europe, which may negatively impact consumers and in turn, sales of our products in the European markets. Similar negative events impacting the market in theUnited States and other developed economies may harm our business.  Many categories within the toy, game and familyentertainment industries in certain developed economies, such as Australia and certain Western European countries, have not grown, or in some cases have even declined, in certain recent years. In addition, many current economic predictions suggestdeveloped economies may grow only modestly, if at all, in the next several years. We have substantial business in developed economies, and these markets represent a majority of our current product sales. It is more difficult for us to grow, or evenmaintain, our business when the overall market in certain of the major countries we serve is not growing or is declining. To succeed in a market that is stable or declining, we must maintain or gain market share from our competitors, which is moredifficult than growing in an expanding market. As long as economic conditions in the developed economies remain difficult, this will be an additional challenge for the Company. An increasing portion of our business is expected to come from emerging markets, and growing business in emergingmarkets presents additional challenges.  We expect an increasing portion of our net revenues to come from emergingmarkets in the future, including Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia. In 2015 revenues in emerging markets constituted approximately 14% of our net revenues, up from only 6% of our net revenues in 2010. Over time, we expect our emerging marketnet revenues to continue to grow both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall business as one of our key business strategies is to increase our presence in emerging and underserved international markets. Operating in an increasingnumber of markets, each with its own unique consumer preferences and business climates, presents additional challenges that we must meet. In addition to the need to successfully anticipate and serve different global consumer preferences andinterests, sales and operations in emerging markets that we have entered, may enter, or may increase our presence in, are subject to other risks associated with international operations, including:     Complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies and the evolution of lawsand regulations that impact our product offerings and related enforcement;      Potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross border transactions;     Difficulties understanding the retail climate, consumer trends, local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be quitedifferent from the United States;   15 Table of Contents   Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another, including port congestion, strikes and other transportation delays andinterruptions; and      The imposition of tariffs, quotas, or other protectionist measures. Because of the importance of our emerging market net revenues, our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if any ofthe risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our emerging market business.  Our business depends in large part on the success of our key partner brands and on our ability to maintain and extend solid relationships with our key partners. As part of our strategy, in addition to developing and marketing products based on properties we own or control, we also seek to obtainlicenses enabling us to develop and market products based on popular entertainment properties owned by third parties.  Wecurrently have in-licenses to several successful entertainment properties, including MARVEL and STAR WARS, each owned by Disney. These licenses typically have multi-year terms and provide us with the right to market and sell designated classes ofproducts. In recent years our sales of products under the MARVEL and STAR WARS licenses have been highly significant to our business. If we fail to meet our contractual commitments and/or any of these licenses were to terminate and not be renewed,or the popularity of any of these licensed properties was to significantly decline, our business would be damaged and we would need to successfully develop and market other products to replace the products previously offered under license. Beginningin 2016, our product offerings under licenses with Disney will expand to include product offerings based on the DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN brands.  Our license to the MARVEL property is granted from Marvel Entertainment, LLC and Marvel Characters B.V. (together Marvel). Our license to the STAR WARS property is granted by Lucas LicensingLtd. and Lucasfilm Ltd. (together Lucas). Both Marvel and Lucas are owned by The Walt Disney Company.  Our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend, in large part, on our sales during the relatively brief holiday shopping season. This seasonality isexacerbated by retailers quick response inventory management techniques.  Sales of our toys, games and otherfamily entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from September through December in anticipation of the holiday season. This seasonality has increased over time, as retailersbecome more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques. Customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers, such as us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers.For toys, games and other family entertainment products which we produce, a majority of retail sales for the entire year generally occur in the fourth quarter, close to the holiday season. As a consequence, the majority of our sales to our customersoccur in the period from September through December, as our customers do not want to maintain large on-hand inventories throughout the year ahead of consumer demand. While these techniques reduce a retailers investment in inventory, theyincrease pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier.  The level of inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us. If we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retailthan was originally anticipated, we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional products to fully meet consumer demand. Additionally, the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases therisk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance. This seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital, mainly to manufacture or acquireinventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory ofproducts that are less popular with consumers. Our   16 Table of Contentsfailure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand, resulting in our under producing popular items and/or overproducing less popular items, would reduce our total sales and harm ourresults of operations. In addition, as a result of the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year, byunforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or economic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods,particularly from the Far East, during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season. The concentration of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing orpromotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us.  We depend upon arelatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products. For the fiscal year ended December 27, 2015, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Toys R Us, Inc. and Target Corporation, accounted for approximately 16%, 9% and 9%,respectively, of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers, including Wal-Mart, Toys R Us and Target, in the aggregate accounted for approximately 39% of our consolidated net revenues. In the U.S. and Canada segment,approximately 59% of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers. If one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing business with us, significantlyreduce the amount of their purchases from us, favor competitors or new entrants, increase their direct competition with us by expanding their private-label business, change their purchasing patterns, alter the manner in which they promote ourproducts or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products, or return substantial amounts of our products, it could significantly harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. Customers make no binding long-term commitmentsto us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders. Any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products, and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted forour products. In addition, increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there wereless consolidation among our customers. Furthermore, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and profitability. Part of our strategy to remain relevant to children and families is to offer innovative products incorporatingprogressive technology, integrating digital and analog play. These products can be more difficult and expensive to design and manufacture which may reduce margins on some or a portion of these products compared to more traditional toys and games andsuch products may have short life spans.  As childhood evolves and children become more interested in sophisticatedproduct offerings, such as video games, consumer electronics and social and digital media, at younger and younger ages, we have sought to keep our products relevant and interesting for these consumers. To continue capturing the interest ofsophisticated youth, we must offer innovative childrens electronic toy and game products. This is another key to our strategy; complementing analog play with digital integration and investing in technology development. These electronic anddigital products, if successful, can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase our sales. However, childrens electronic and digital products, in addition to the risks associated with our other family entertainmentproducts, also face certain additional risks.  Costs associated with designing, developing and producing technologicallyadvanced or sophisticated products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products, such as board games and action figures. In order to recoup these higher costs, sufficient sales quantities at sufficient prices which reflectthose higher costs are necessary but may be constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment products, and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions meaning we can face increased risk of not achievingsales sufficient to recover our costs. Additionally, designing, developing and producing technologically advanced or sophisticated products requires different competencies and follows   17 Table of Contentsdifferent timelines than traditional toys and games. Delays in the design, development or production of these products incorporated into or associated with traditional toys and games could have asignificant impact on our ability to successfully offer such products. In addition, the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than for our other products. Thispace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games.  Our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the United States subject us to risks associated with international operations. We operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the United States. For the year ended December 27, 2015, ournet revenues from the International segment comprised approximately 44% of our total consolidated net revenues. We expect net revenues from our International segment to continue accounting for a significant portion of our revenues. In fact, overtime, we expect our international sales and operations to continue to grow both in dollars and as a percentage of our overall business as a result of a key business strategy to expand our presence in emerging and underserved international markets.Additionally, as we discuss below, we utilize third-party manufacturers located in the Far East to produce our products. These sales and manufacturing operations, including operations in emerging markets that we have entered, may enter, or mayincrease our presence in, are subject to the risks associated with international operations, including:      Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;      Limitations on the repatriation of earnings;      Potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross border transactions, which can materially increase our taxesand other costs of doing business;      Political instability, civil unrest and economic instability;     Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;     Complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies and the evolution of lawsand regulations and related enforcement;      Difficulties understanding the retail climate, consumer trends, local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be quitedifferent from the United States;      Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and cost in recovering therefrom;     Transportation delays and interruptions;      Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another, including port congestion, strikes and other transportation delays andinterruptions;      Increased investment and operational complexity to make our products compatible with systems in various countries and compliant with local laws;     Changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing business internationally; and     The imposition of tariffs, quotas, or other protectionist measures. Because of the importance of our international sales, sourcing and manufacturing to our business, our financial condition and results ofoperations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business.   18 Table of ContentsOther economic and public health conditions in the markets in which weoperate, including rising commodity and fuel prices, higher labor costs, increased transportation costs, outbreaks of public health pandemics or other diseases, or third party conduct could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship ourproducts, and lower our revenues, margins and profitability.  Various economic and public health conditions can impactour ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and cost-effective manner, or can otherwise have a significant negative impact on our revenues, profitability and business. Significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers, such as gasoline, home heating fuels, or groceries,may reduce household spending on the discretionary branded-play entertainment products we offer. As we discussed above, weakened economic conditions, lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may significantly reduceconsumer purchases of our products. Economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks, wars and other conflicts, natural disasters, increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs, or the prospect of such events. Such aweakened economic and business climate, as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate, could harm our revenues and profitability.  Our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products, but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit. Rising fuel andraw material prices, for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components, increased transportation costs, and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase thecosts we incur to produce and transport our products, which in turn may reduce our margins, reduce our profitability and harm our business.  Other conditions, such as the unavailability of sufficient quantities of electrical components, may impede our ability to manufacture, source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis.Additional factors outside of our control could further delay our products or increase the cost we pay to produce such products. For example, work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic, a natural disaster orthe occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts, all could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product. Any of these factors could result in product delays, increased costs and/or lost sales for our products. We may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expectedor if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties.  In additionto designing and developing products based on our own brands, we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests by producing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by third parties and licensed to us. The success ofentertainment properties for which we have a license, such as MARVEL, STAR WARS, SESAME STREET, DISNEY PRINCESS, FROZEN , TROLLS or YOKAI-WATCH related products, can significantly affect our revenues and profitability. If we produce a line ofproducts based on a movie or television series, the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering. In addition, competition in our industry for access toentertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure, maintain, and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms, if at all, and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design, develop and marketsuccessful products based on these properties.  The license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us topay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial, and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales, which could result in write-offs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results ofoperations. At December 27, 2015, we had $124.4 million of prepaid royalties, $47.5 million of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $76.8 million of which are included in other assets. Under the terms of existingcontracts as of December 27, 2015, we may be required to pay additional future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately $426.4 million. Acquiring or renewing  19 Table of Contentslicenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable, which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they becomeavailable for renewal, or missing business opportunities for new licenses. Additionally, as a licensee of entertainment-based properties we have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy, game or other familyentertainment products, and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us. We anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably selllicensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to besuccessful or maintain a high level of sales in the future, as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market. In the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainmentlicenses on advantageous terms, our revenues and profits may be harmed.  Our use of third-partymanufacturers to produce our products, as well as certain other products, presents risks to our business.  With thesale of our remaining manufacturing facilities in 2015, all of our products are now manufactured by third-party manufacturers, the majority of which are located in China. Should changes be necessary, our external sources of manufacturing can beshifted, over a significant period of time, to alternative sources of supply. If we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political, civil, labor or other factors beyond ourcontrol, including natural disasters or pandemics, our operations may be substantially disrupted, potentially for a significant period of time. This delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business whilealternative sources of supply are secured.  Given that our toy manufacturing is conducted by third-party manufacturers, themajority of whom are located in China, health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in China and affecting the movement of people and products into and from China to our major markets, including North America andEurope, as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in China, could have a significant negative impact on our operations, revenues and earnings. Factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential significant revaluation of the Chinese Yuan, which may result in anincrease in the cost of producing products in China, labor shortages and increases in labor costs in China as well as difficulties in moving products manufactured in China out of Asia and through the ports in North America and Europe, whether due toport congestion, labor disputes, slow downs, product regulations and/or inspections or other factors. Prolonged disputes or slowdowns at the west coast port can negatively impact both the time and cost of transporting goods into the United States.Natural disasters or health pandemics impacting China can also have a significant negative impact on our business. Further, the imposition of trade sanctions or other regulations by the United States or the European Union against products importedby us from, or the loss of normal trade relations status with, China, could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the United States or Europe and harm our business. Additionally, the suspension of the operations of athird-party manufacturer by government inspectors in China could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales. We require our third-party manufacturers to comply with our Global Business Ethics Principles, which are designed to prevent productsmanufactured for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions. Our Global Business Ethics Principles address a number of issues, including working hours and compensation, health and safety, and abuse and discrimination. Inaddition, we require that our products supplied by third-party manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including consumer and product safety laws in the markets where those products are sold. Hasbro has theright and exercises such right, both directly and through the use of outside monitors, to monitor compliance by our third-party manufacturers with our Global Business Ethics Principles and other manufacturing requirements. In addition, we do qualityassurance testing on our products, including products manufactured for us by third parties. Notwithstanding these   20 Table of Contentsrequirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them, there is always a risk that one or more of our third-party manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that wewill not immediately discover such non-compliance. Any failure of our third-party manufacturers to comply with labor, consumer, product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to ourreputation, harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us.  If we are unable tosuccessfully adapt to the evolution of gaming, our revenues and profitability may decline.  Recognizing the criticalneed for increased innovation and a change in the way we go to market with gaming products in order to remain successful in the gaming business in the future, we began implementing a strategy in 2011 to reinvent our gaming business. The objective ofthis plan was to stabilize our gaming business in 2012, and to position it to grow over the long-term. Our strategy to drive our gaming business in the future involves substantial changes in how we market our gaming products to consumers and how weposition them at retail, a focus on understanding consumer insights and in delivering industry leading innovation in gaming, a change in our allocation of focus across gaming brands, greater penetration of our brands into digital gaming and thesuccessful combination of analog and digital gaming. Our strategy also involves making changes in how we design and develop our gaming products. We recognize the need to provide immersive game play that is easy for consumers to learn and play inshorter periods of time, as well as offer innovative face to face, off the board and digital gaming opportunities. People are gaming in greater numbers than ever before, but the nature of gaming has and continues to evolve quickly. To be successfulour gaming offerings must evolve to anticipate and meet these changes in consumer gaming. Our failure to successfully implement our strategy and to keep up with the evolution of gaming could substantially harm our business, resulting in lostrevenues and lost profits.  Our success is critically dependent on the efforts and dedication of ourofficers and other employees.  Our officers and employees are at the heart of all of our efforts. It is their skill,innovation and hard work that drive our success. We compete with many other potential employers in recruiting, hiring and retaining our senior management team and our many other skilled officers and other employees around the world. There is noguarantee that we will be able to recruit, hire or retain the senior management, officers and other employees we need to succeed. Additionally, we have experienced significant changes in our workforce from our restructuring efforts and therecruitment and hiring of new skill sets required for our changing global business. We have added hundreds of employees in our global markets, in licensing and in entertainment and storytelling capabilities, while reducing our overall workforce overthe last several years. These changes in employee composition, both in terms of global distribution and in skill sets, has required changes in our business. Our loss of key management or other employees, or our inability to hire talented people withthe skill sets we need for our changing business, could significantly harm our business.  To remaincompetitive we must continuously work to increase efficiency and reduce costs, but there is no guarantee we will be successful in this regard.  Our business is extremely competitive, the pace of change in our industry is getting faster and our competitors are always working to be more efficient and profitable. To compete we must continuouslyimprove our processes, increase efficiency and work to reduce our expenses. We intend to achieve this partly by focusing on fewer, more global brand initiatives and through process improvements, including in global product development. However,these actions are no guarantee we will achieve our cost savings goal and we may realize fewer benefits than are expected from this initiative.  Our business is critically dependent on our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully. Our intellectual property, including our trademarks and tradenames, copyrights, patents, and rights under our license agreements and otheragreements that establish our intellectual property rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, is of critical value. We rely on a combination of trade secret,   21 Table of Contentscopyright, trademark, patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands in the United States and around the world. From timeto time, third parties have challenged, and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our intellectual property in the United States and around the world. In addition, our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeitingour products or infringing on our intellectual property rights. We may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. Similarly, third parties may claimownership over certain aspects of our products or other intellectual property. Our failure to successfully protect our intellectual property rights could significantly harm our business and competitive position. We have a material amount of acquired product rights which, if impaired, would result in a reduction of our netearnings.  Much of our intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on ourconsolidated balance sheets. However, as of December 27, 2015, we had $280.8 million of acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Declines in the profitability of the acquired brands orlicensed products or our decision to reduce our focus or exit these brands may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge. Reduction in our net earnings caused by impairmentcharges could harm our financial results.  We rely on external financing, including our credit facility,to help fund our operations. If we were unable to obtain or service such financing, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome, our business would be harmed. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our working capital needs, particularly those in the third and fourthquarters, we rely on our commercial paper program, revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital. We currently have a commercial paper program which, subject to market conditions, and availability under our committedrevolving credit facility, allows us to issue up to $700.0 million in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a source of working capital funding and liquidity. There is no guarantee that we will be able to issuecommercial paper on favorable terms, or at all, at any given point in time.  We also have a revolving credit agreement thatexpires in 2020, which provides for a $700.0 million committed revolving credit facility and a further source of working capital funding and liquidity. This facility also supports borrowings under our commercial paper program. The credit agreementcontains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility. These restrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial,operating and strategic flexibility. In addition, our financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility. Our performance and financial condition may not meet our original expectations, causing us to fail to meet suchfinancial covenants. Non-compliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines, a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls wouldmost require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations.  Not only may our individual financialperformance impact our ability to access sources of external financing, but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing. In times of severe economic downturn and/or distress in the creditmarkets, it is possible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us. In such a situation, it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities, and it mightnot be possible to find alternative sources of funding.  We also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to time,through the issuance of debt securities. Our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interestrates, and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit markets and   22 Table of Contentsprevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securitiesor require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities. The failure to receive financing on desirable terms, or at all, could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other businessactivities.  As of December 27, 2015, we had $1,559.9 million of total principal amount of long-term debt outstanding. Ifwe are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default. There is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms, or at all. As a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation, we are subject to various governmentregulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future, violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business. In addition, we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls, whichcould harm our business.  As a manufacturer of consumer products, we are subject to significant government regulations,including, in the United States, under The Consumer Products Safety Act, The Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and The Flammable Fabrics Act, as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets. In addition,certain of our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration or similar international authorities. Advertising to children is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and ahost of other agencies globally, and the collection of information from children under the age of thirteen is subject to the provisions of the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act and other privacy laws around the world. While we take allthe steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance and failure to comply with these acts could result in sanctions which could have a negative impact on our business, financialcondition and results of operations. We may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall. While costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business, the costsassociated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant. In addition, any product recall, regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm consumer perceptions of our products and havea negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations.  Governments and regulatory agencies in the markets wherewe manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations. Inaddition, one or more of our customers might require changes in our products, such as the non-use of certain materials, in the future. Complying with any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business.Similarly, increased penalties for non-compliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations. Such increased costs or penalties could harm our business. As a large, multinational corporation, we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world, including antitrust,customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, environmental regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully complywith any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition.  We may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures, or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization. Acquisitions and investments have been a component of our historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify ourproduct offerings. In reviewing potential acquisitions or investments, we target companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products or offerings, the ability for us to leverage our family entertainment offerings, andopportunities to drive our strategic brand blueprint or other synergies. In the case of our joint venture with Discovery, we looked to partner with a company that has shown   23 Table of Contentsthe ability to establish and operate compelling entertainment channels. Additionally, through our acquisition of a 70% interest in Backflip Studios, we looked to strengthen our mobile gamingexpertise. However, we cannot be certain that the products and offerings of companies we may acquire, or acquire an interest in, will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments willallow us to more effectively market our products or to grow our business. In some cases, we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production, marketing and other operating synergies whichwill produce greater revenue growth and profitability and, where applicable, cost savings, operating efficiencies and other advantages. However, we cannot be certain that these synergies, efficiencies and cost savings will be realized. Even ifachieved, these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization. In other cases, we may acquire or invest in companies that we believe have strong and creative management, in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously ratherthan fully integrating them into our operations. We cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products or services inthe future. There is no guarantee that any acquisition or investment we may make will be successful or beneficial, and acquisitions can consume significant amounts of management attention and other resources, which may negatively impact otheraspects of our business.  Failure to successfully operate our information systems and implement newtechnology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability.  We rely extensively on variousinformation technology systems and software applications to manage many aspects of our business, including product development, management of our supply chain, sale and delivery of our products, financial reporting and various other processes andtransactions. We are critically dependent on the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems and related back-up systems. These systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunicationsfailures, computer viruses, malware and other security breaches, catastrophic events such as hurricanes, fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees. The efficient operation and successful growthof our business depends on these information systems, including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully. The failureof our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business, require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability. If our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed. We maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world. This data relates to all aspects of our business,including current and future products and entertainment under development, and also contains certain customer, consumer, supplier, partner and employee data. We maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data, but notwithstanding suchprotective measures, there is a risk of intrusion or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data. In addition, we provide confidential and proprietary information to our third-party business partners in certain cases wheredoing so is necessary to conduct our business. While we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data, and where applicable, that they will take steps to assure the protections of such databy third parties, nonetheless those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of such data. Any compromise of the confidential data of our customers, consumers, suppliers, partners, employees or ourselves,or failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of or damage to this data through breach of our information technology systems or other means could substantially disrupt our operations, harm our customers, consumers and other business partners, damageour reputation, violate applicable laws and regulations and subject us to additional costs and liabilities and loss of business that could be material.  From time to time, we are involved in litigation, arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense. As a large multinational corporation, we are subject, from time to time, to regulatory investigations, litigation and arbitrationdisputes, including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by   24 Table of Contentsthe users of products that have been or may be developed by us as well as claims by third parties that our products infringe upon or misuse such third parties property or rights. Becausethe outcome of litigation, arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant cost for us and harm our business. The fact that we operate ina significant number of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements. Any successful claim against us couldsignificantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Changes in, ordiffering interpretations of, income tax laws and rules, and changes in our geographic operating results, may impact our effective tax rate.  We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in various international tax jurisdictions. We also conduct business activities between our operating units in various jurisdictions and we aresubject to transfer pricing rules in the countries in which we operate. There is some degree of uncertainty and subjectivity in complying with transfer pricing rules. Our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in, or the interpretation of,tax laws or by changes in the amount of revenue and earnings we derive, or are determined to derive by tax authorities, from jurisdictions with differing tax rates. Unanticipated changes in our tax rate could impact our results of operations. Inaddition, we may be subject to tax examinations by federal, state, and international jurisdictions, and these examinations can result in significant tax findings if the tax authorities interpret the application of laws and rules differently than wedo or disagree with the intercompany rates we are applying. We assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from tax uncertainties. At December 27, 2015 we have a liability for uncertain tax benefits of $68.3 million. While we believe ourestimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome of these uncertain tax benefits, or results of possible current or future tax examinations, may differ from our estimates and may have a significant adverse impact on our business and operating results. We have a material amount of goodwill which, if it becomes impaired, would result in a reduction in ournet earnings.  Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets weacquire. Goodwill is not amortized and is required to be periodically evaluated for impairment. At December 27, 2015, $592.7 million, or 12.5%, of our total assets represented goodwill. Declines in our profitability may impact the fair value ofour reporting units, which could result in a write-down of our goodwill and consequently harm our results of operations. Included in goodwill is $119.1 million related to Backflip. Should Backflip not achieve its profitability and growth targets,including anticipated game releases in 2016, the carrying value may become impaired.   "

. Forward-Looking Information and Risk Factors
 That May Affect Future Results From time to time, including in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our annual report to shareholders, we publish forward-lookingstatements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may relate to such matters as our business and marketing strategies, anticipated financial performance orbusiness prospects in future periods, including with respect to our planned cost savings initiative, expected technological and product developments, the expected content of and timing for scheduled new product introductions or our expectationsconcerning the future acceptance of products by customers, the content and timing of planned entertainment releases including motion pictures, television and digital products; and marketing and promotional efforts, research and developmentactivities, liquidity, and similar matters. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. These statementsmay be identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as anticipate, believe, could, expect, intend, looking forward, may, planned,potential, should, will and would or any variations of words with similar meanings. We note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ materially from theanticipated results or other expectations expressed or anticipated in our forward-looking statements. The factors listed below are illustrative and other risks and uncertainties may arise as are or may be detailed from time to time in our publicannouncements and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K. We undertake no obligation to make any revisions to the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in ourannual report to shareholders to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of the filing of this report. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all dollar or share amounts herein are expressed in thousands of dollars or shares,except for per share amounts.  We are focusing our global efforts around our brand architecture, which includes aheightened emphasis and reliance on our franchise and key partner brands.  We have made a strategic decision to focuson fewer, larger global brands as we build our business. We are moving away from SKU making behaviors, which involve building a large number of products across many brands, towards global brand building with an emphasis on our franchise andpartner brands, which we view as   11 Table of Contentshaving the largest global potential. As we concentrate our efforts on a more select group of brands, our future success depends to a greater extent on our ability to successfully developthose brands across our brand blueprint and to maintain and extend the reach and relevance of those brands to global consumers in a wide array of markets. In 2014 revenues from our seven franchise brands, LITTLEST PET SHOP, MAGIC: THEGATHERING, MONOPOLY, NERF, MY LITTLE PONY, PLAY-DOH and TRANSFORMERS, totaled 55% of our aggregate net revenues. Our key partner brands, such as DISNEY, MARVEL, LUCASFILM, SESAME STREET and ROVIO, also constitute a significant portion of ouroverall business. Together our franchise and partner brands are critical to our business. If we are unable to successfully execute this strategy and to maintain and develop our franchise and key partner brands in the future, such that our productofferings based on these brands are not sought after by consumers to the extent required to maintain and grow those brands, our revenues and profits will decline and our business performance will be harmed. Consumer interests change rapidly, making it difficult to design and develop products which will be popular with children andfamilies.  The interests of children and families evolve extremely quickly and can change dramatically from year toyear. To be successful we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment content, products and play patterns which will capture childrens and families interests and imagination and quickly develop and introduce innovative productswhich can compete successfully for consumers limited time, attention and spending. This challenge is more difficult with the ever increasing utilization of technology and digital media in entertainment offerings, and the increasingbreadth of entertainment available to consumers. Evolving consumer tastes and shifting interests, coupled with an ever changing and expanding pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for childrens andfamilies interest and acceptance, create an environment in which some products can fail to achieve consumer acceptance, and other products can be popular during a certain period of time but then be rapidly replaced. As a result, individualchild and family entertainment products and properties often have short consumer life cycles. If we devote time and resources to developing entertainment and products that consumers do not find interesting enough to buy in significantquantities to be profitable to us, our revenues and profits may decline and our business performance may be damaged. Similarly, if our product offerings and entertainment fail to correctly anticipate consumer interests our revenues and earnings willbe reduced.  Additionally, our business is increasingly global and depends on interest in and acceptance of our child andfamily entertainment products and properties by consumers in diverse markets around the world with different tastes and preferences. As such, our success depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes andpreferences in multiple markets and geographies and to design product and entertainment offerings that can achieve popularity globally over a broad and diverse consumer audience. The challenge of continuously developing and offering products that are sought after by children is compounded by thesophistication of todays children and the increasing array of technology and entertainment offerings available to them.  Children are increasingly utilizing electronic offerings such as tablet devices and mobile phones and they are expanding their interests to a wider array of innovative, technology-driven entertainmentproducts and digital and social media offerings at younger and younger ages. Our products compete with the offerings of consumer electronics companies, digital media and social media companies. To meet this challenge we, and our competitors,are designing and marketing products which incorporate increasing technology, seek to combine digital and analog play, and capitalize on new play patterns and increased consumption of digital and social media. With the increasing array of competitive entertainment offerings, there is no guarantee that:     Any of our brands, products or product lines will achieve popularity or continue to be popular;     Any property for which we have a significant license will achieve or sustain popularity;     Any new products or product lines we introduce will be considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate market acceptance; or  12 Table of Contents   Any products life cycle or sales quantities will be sufficient to permit us to profitably recover our development, manufacturing, marketing,royalties (including royalty advances and guarantees) and other costs of producing, marketing and selling the product.  Entertainment is an increasingly important success factor for our brand awareness, storytelling and brand building.  Entertainment media, in forms such as television, motion pictures, digital products, digital shorts, DVD releases and other media, have become increasingly important platforms for consumers to experienceour brands and our partners brands and the success, or lack of success, of such media efforts can significantly impact the demand for our products and our financial success. We spend considerable resources in designing and developing productsin conjunction with planned media releases, both by our partners and our own media releases. Not only our efforts, but the efforts of third parties, heavily impact the timing of media development, release dates and the ultimate consumer interest inand success of these media efforts.  For 2015 we are developing and marketing significant product lines tied to the scheduledmotion picture releases by key partners of AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON, JURASSIC WORLD and STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS. Those motion pictures are all being developed and released by our partners and our partners control thecontent and schedule for such motion pictures. Similarly, we are developing and marketing products for entertainment we play a more active role in developing or develop ourselves. If those motion pictures, or any other key entertainment content forwhich we develop and market products are not as successful as we and our partners anticipate, our revenues and earnings will be reduced.  The ultimate timing and success of such projects is critically dependent on the efforts and schedules of our licensors, and studio and media partners. We do not fully control when or if anyparticular motion picture projects will be greenlit, developed or released, and our licensors or media partners may change their plans with respect to projects and release dates or cancel development all together. This can make it difficult forus to get feature films developed, plan future entertainment slates and to successfully develop and market products in conjunction with future motion picture and other media releases, given the lengthy lead times involved in product development andsuccessful marketing efforts.  When we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases, thosestatements are based on our current plans and expectations. Unforeseen factors may increase the cost of these releases, delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation. Any delay or cancellation of planned product development work,introductions, or media support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business.  Lack of sufficientconsumer interest in entertainment media for which we offer products can harm our business.  Motion pictures,television, digital products or other media for which we develop products may not be as popular with consumers as we anticipated. While it is difficult to anticipate what products may be sought after by consumers, it can be even more difficultto properly predict the popularity of media efforts and properties given the broad array of competing offerings. If our and our partners media efforts fail to garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance, our revenues and the financialreturn from such efforts will be harmed.  Discovery Family Channel, our cable television joint venture with DiscoveryCommunications, Inc. in the United States, competes with a number of other childrens television networks for viewers, advertising revenue and distribution fees. There is no guarantee that Discovery Family Channel will be successful. Similarly,Hasbro Studios programming distributed internationally and Backflip Studios digital products compete with content from many other parties. Lack of consumer interest in and acceptance of content developed by Hasbro Studios and BackflipStudios, or other content appearing on Discovery Family Channel, and products related to that content, could significantly harm our business. Similarly, our business could be harmed by greater than expected costs, or unexpected delays ordifficulties, associated with our investment in Discovery Family Channel, such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or in building advertising revenues for Discovery Family Channel. During 2014 the Company spent $31,424 forprogramming developed by Hasbro Studios and anticipates that it will continue spending at comparable levels in 2015 and future years.   13 Table of ContentsAt December 28, 2014, $244,587, or 5.4%, of our total assets, represented ourinvestment in Discovery Family Channel. If Discovery Family Channel does not achieve success, or if there are subsequent declines in the success or profitability of the channel, then our investment may become impaired, which could result in awrite-down through net earnings.  The childrens and family entertainment industry is highly competitive and thebarriers to entry are low. If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors or with our retailers private label toy products our revenues, market share and profitability could decline. The childrens and family entertainment industry is, and will continue to be, highly competitive. We compete in the UnitedStates and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers, marketers, and sellers of analog toys and games, digital gaming products, digital media, products which combine analog and digital play, and other entertainment andconsumer products, as well as with retailers who offer such products under their own private labels. We face competitors who are constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends, seeking ideas which will appeal toconsumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase.  In addition toexisting competitors, the barriers to entry for new participants in the childrens and family entertainment industry are low, and the increasing importance of digital media, and the heightened connection between digital media and consumerinterest, has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets, and has broadened the array of companies we compete with. New participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers andbecome a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time. These existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences. Our competitors products mayachieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products, lower our revenues and lower our profitability.  In recent years, retailers have also developed their own private-label products that directly compete with the products of traditional manufacturers. Some retail chains that are our customers sellprivate-label childrens and family entertainment products designed, manufactured and branded by the retailers themselves. These products may be sold at prices lower than our prices for comparable products, which may result in lowerpurchases of our products by these retailers and may reduce our market share.  An inability to develop and introduceplanned products, product lines and new brands in a timely and cost-effective manner may damage our business.  Indeveloping products, product lines and new brands we have anticipated dates for the associated product and brand introductions. When we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a particular product, product line or brand at a certaintime in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development, implementation, and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule. There is no guarantee that we will be able tomanufacture, source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a cost-effective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands. This risk is heightened by our customers compressed shipping schedules and theseasonality of our business. The risk is also exacerbated by the increasing sophistication of many of the products we are designing, and brands we are developing in terms of combining digital and analog technologies, utilizing digital media toa greater degree, and providing greater innovation and product differentiation. Unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process, significant increases in the planned cost of development, or changes in anticipated consumer demandfor our products and new brands may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or, in some situations, may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance. Our global operations mean we produce and buy products, and sell products, in many different jurisdictions with many differentcurrencies. As a result, if the exchange rate between the United States dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes, our financial results as reported in U.S. dollars,may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not   14 Table of Contentssignificantly affected. As an example, if the dollar appreciates 10% relative to a local currency for an international market in which we had $200 million of net revenues, the dollar valueof those sales, as they are translated into U.S. dollars, would decrease by $20 million in our consolidated financial results. As such, we would recognize a $20 million decrease in our net revenues, even if the actual level of salesin the foreign market had not changed. Similarly, our expenses can be significantly impacted, in U.S. dollar terms, by exchange rates, meaning the profitability of our business in U.S. dollar terms can be negatively impacted by exchangerate movements which we do not control. Late in 2014 certain key currencies, such as the Euro, Russian Ruble, and Brazilian Real depreciated significantly compared to the U.S. dollar. This depreciation had a significant negative impact on our 2014revenues and earnings. Similar depreciation in key currencies during 2015 may have a significant negative impact on our revenues and earnings as they are reported in U.S. dollars. United States, global and regional economic downturns that negatively impact the retail and credit markets, or that otherwisedamage the financial health of our retail customers and consumers, can harm our business and financial performance.  Wedesign, manufacture and market a wide variety of entertainment and consumer products worldwide through sales to our retail customers and directly to consumers. Our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumerspending in the markets in which we operate. Recessions, credit crises and other economic downturns, or disruptions in credit markets, in the United States and in other markets in which our products are marketed and sold can result in lowerlevels of economic activity, lower employment levels, less consumer disposable income, and lower consumer confidence. Similarly, reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers, such as their homes or stock market investments, can lowerconsumer confidence and consumer spending power. Any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products. This in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability. In addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our products during times of economic difficulty, in an effort to maintainsales during such times we may need to reduce the price of our products, increase our promotional spending and/or sales allowances, or take other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products. Those steps may lower our netrevenues or increase our costs, thereby decreasing our operating margins and lowering our profitability.  Challengingmarket conditions in certain developed economies, such as in the United States, Canada, Australia and certain Western European countries, make it more difficult for us to succeed. Our future success in the United States, Canada, Australia, Europe and other developed economies is impacted by market conditions. Forexample, a European sovereign debt crisis or other significant negative shock to European markets could lead to a recession in Europe, which may negatively impact consumers and in turn, sales of our products in the European markets. Similarnegative events impacting the market in the United States and other developed economies may harm our business.  Many categorieswithin the toy, game and family entertainment industries in the United States, Canada, Australia, certain Western European countries and other developed economies have not grown, or in some cases have even declined, in recent years. Inaddition, many current economic predictions suggest developed economies may grow only modestly, if at all, in the next several years. We have substantial business in developed economies, and these markets represent a majority of our current productsales. It is more difficult for us to grow, or even maintain, our business when the overall market in certain of the major countries we serve is not growing or is declining. To succeed in a market that is stable or declining, we must maintainor gain market share from our competitors, which is more difficult than growing in an expanding market. As long as economic conditions in the developed economies remain difficult, this will be an additional challenge for the Company. An increasing portion of our business is expected to come from emerging markets, and growing business in emergingmarkets presents additional challenges.  We expect an increasing portion of our net revenues to come from emergingmarkets, including Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia. In 2014 revenues in emerging markets constituted approximately 16% of our net   15 Table of Contentsrevenues, up from only 6% of our net revenues in 2010. Over time, we expect our emerging market net revenues to continue to grow both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overallbusiness as one of our key business strategies is to increase our presence in emerging and underserved international markets. Operating in an increasing number of markets, each with its own unique consumer preferences and business climates,presents additional challenges that we must meet. In addition to the need to successfully anticipate and serve different global consumer preferences and interests, sales and operations in emerging markets that we have entered, may enter, or mayincrease our presence in, are subject to other risks associated with international operations, including:      Complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies and the evolution of lawsand regulations that impact our product offerings and related enforcement;      Potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross border transactions;     Difficulties understanding the retail climate, consumer trends, local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be quitedifferent from the United States;      Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another, including port congestion, strikes and other transportation delays andinterruptions; and      The imposition of tariffs, quotas, or other protectionist measures. Because of the importance of our emerging market net revenues, our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if any ofthe risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our emerging market business. Our business depends in large part on the success of our key partner brands and on our ability to maintain and extend solidrelationships with our key partners.  As part of our strategy, in addition to developing and marketing products basedon properties we own or control, we also seek to obtain licenses enabling us to develop and market products based on popular entertainment properties owned by third parties.  We currently have in-licenses to several successful entertainment properties, including MARVEL and STAR WARS, owned by Disney, as well as SESAME STREET and ROVIO. These licenses typically havemulti-year terms and provide us with the right to market and sell designated classes of products. In recent years our sales of products under the MARVEL, STAR WARS, SESAME STREET and ROVIO licenses have been highly significant to ourbusiness. If we fail to meet our contractual commitments and/or any of these licenses were to terminate and not be renewed, or the popularity of any of these licensed properties was to significantly decline, our business would be damaged and wewould need to successfully develop and market other products to replace the products previously offered under license. In 2015 we anticipate offering products based on the DISNEY DESCENDANTS brand as well and beginning in 2016, we anticipateoffering products based on the DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN brands.  Our license to the MARVEL property is granted from MarvelEntertainment, LLC and Marvel Characters B.V. (together Marvel). Our license to the STAR WARS property is granted by Lucas Licensing Ltd. and Lucasfilm Ltd. (together Lucas). Both Marvel and Lucas are owned by TheWalt Disney Company.  Our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend, in large part, onour sales during the relatively brief holiday shopping season. This seasonality is exacerbated by retailers quick response inventory management techniques.  Sales of our toys, games and other family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from September through December inanticipation of the holiday season, including Christmas. This seasonality has increased over time, as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques. Customers are timingtheir orders so that they are being filled by suppliers, such as us, closer to the time of purchase by   16 Table of Contentsconsumers. For toys, games and other family entertainment products which we produce, a majority of retail sales for the entire year generally occur in the fourth quarter, close to the holidayseason. As a consequence, the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from September through December, as our customers do not want to maintain large on-hand inventories throughout the year ahead of consumer demand. While thesetechniques reduce a retailers investment in inventory, they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier. The level of inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lower revenues for us. If we or ourcustomers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional products to fully meet consumer demand. Additionally, the logistics ofsupplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance. This seasonal pattern requiressignificant use of working capital, mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losingpotential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers. Our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand, resulting in our under producing popular items and/or overproducingless popular items, would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations. In addition, as a result of the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the impact on acompany with sales spread more evenly throughout the year, by unforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or economic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events such as strikes orport delays that interfere with the shipment of goods, particularly from the Far East, during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season.  The concentration of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policies or patterns of our major customers could have a significant impacton us.  We depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products. For the fiscalyear ended December 28, 2014, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Toys R Us, Inc. and Target Corporation, accounted for approximately 16%, 9% and 8%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers, includingWal-Mart, Toys R Us and Target, in the aggregate accounted for approximately 38% of our consolidated net revenues. In the U.S. and Canada segment, approximately 59% of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top threecustomers. If one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing business with us, significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us, favor competitors or new entrants,increase their direct competition with us by expanding their private-label business, change their purchasing patterns, alter the manner in which they promote our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products, or returnsubstantial amounts of our products, it could significantly harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. Customers make no binding long-term commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchaseorders. Any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products, and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products. In addition, increased concentration among our customerscould also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers. Furthermore, the bankruptcy orother lack of success of one or more of our significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and profitability.  Part of our strategy to remain relevant to children and families is to offer innovative products incorporating greater technology and which combine digital and analog play. These products can bemore difficult and expensive to design and manufacture, margins on some portion of these products are lower than more traditional toys and games and such products may have short life spans. As children have grown older younger and have otherwise become interested in more and more sophisticated and adult products,such as video games, consumer electronics and social and digital media, at   17 Table of Contentsyounger and younger ages, we have sought to keep our products relevant and interesting for these consumers. One initiative we have pursued to capture the interest of children is to offerinnovative childrens electronic toy and game products. Increasing the marriage between digital and analog gaming and increasing the technology in our gaming products is another key for our future strategy. These electronic and digitalproducts, if successful, can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase our sales. However, childrens electronic and digital products, in addition to the risks associated with our other family entertainment products,also face certain additional risks.  Our costs for designing, developing and producing electronic and digital products, orproducts that combine digital and analog technology, tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products, such as board games and action figures. The ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient sales quantities and toreflect higher costs in higher prices is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment products, and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions. As a consequence, our margins on the sales of theseproducts can be lower than for more traditional products and we can face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs. Additionally, designing, developing and producing electronic and digital products requires differentcompetencies and follows different timelines than traditional toys and games. Delays in the design, development or production of electronic or digital products incorporated into or associated with traditional toys and games could have asignificant impact on our ability to successfully offer such projects. In addition, the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than for our other products.This pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games.  Our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the United States subject us to risks associated with international operations. We operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the United States. For the year ended December 28, 2014, ournet revenues from the International segment comprised approximately 47% of our total consolidated net revenues. We expect our sales to international customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues. In fact, over time, weexpect our international sales and operations to continue to grow both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall business as one of our key business strategies is to increase our presence in emerging and underserved international markets.Additionally, as we discuss below, we utilize third-party manufacturers located in the Far East to produce the substantial majority of our products, and we have a manufacturing facility in Ireland. These sales and manufacturing operations, includingoperations in emerging markets that we have entered, may enter, or may increase our presence in, are subject to the risks associated with international operations, including:     Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;      Limitations on the repatriation of earnings;      Potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross border transactions, which can materially increase our taxesand other costs of doing business;      Political instability, civil unrest and economic instability;     Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;     Complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies and the evolution of lawsand regulations and related enforcement;      Difficulties understanding the retail climate, consumer trends, local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be quitedifferent from the United States;      Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and cost in recovering therefrom;     Transportation delays and interruptions;   18 Table of Contents   Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another, including port congestion, strikes and other transportation delays andinterruptions;      Increased investment and operational complexity to make our products compatible with systems in various countries and compliant with local laws;     Changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing business internationally; and     The imposition of tariffs, quotas, or other protectionist measures. Because of the importance of our international sales and international sourcing of manufacturing to our business, our financial conditionand results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business. Other economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we operate, including rising commodity and fuel prices, higherlabor costs, increased transportation costs, outbreaks of public health pandemics or other diseases, or third party conduct could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products, and lower our revenues, margins and profitability. Various economic and public health conditions can impact our ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timelyand cost-effective manner, or can otherwise have a significant negative impact on our revenues, profitability and business. Significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers, such as gasoline, home heating fuels, or groceries,may reduce household spending on the discretionary branded play entertainment products we offer. As we discussed above, weakened economic conditions, lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may significantly reduceconsumer purchases of our products. Economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist attacks, wars and other conflicts, natural disasters, increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs, or the prospect of such events. Such aweakened economic and business climate, as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate, could harm our revenues and profitability.  Our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for our products, but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit. Rising fuel andraw material prices, for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components, increased transportation costs, and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase thecosts we incur to produce and transport our products, which in turn may reduce our margins, reduce our profitability and harm our business.  Other conditions, such as the unavailability of sufficient quantities of electrical components, may impede our ability to manufacture, source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis.Additional factors outside of our control could further delay our products or increase the cost we pay to produce such products. For example, work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic, a natural disaster orthe occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts, all could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product. Any of these factors could result in product delays, increased costs and/or lost sales for our products. We may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if revenuefrom the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties.  In addition to designingand developing products based on our own brands, we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests by producing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by third parties and licensed to us. The success of entertainmentproperties for which we have a license, such as MARVEL, STAR WARS, SESAME STREET or ROVIO related products, can significantly affect our revenues and profitability. If we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series, the successof the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering. In addition, competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure,  19 Table of Contentsmaintain, and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms, if at all, and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design, develop and market successfulproducts based on these properties.  The license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimumroyalty guarantees that may be substantial, and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales, which could result in write-offs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results of operations. AtDecember 28, 2014, we had $230,840 of prepaid royalties, $132,146 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $98,694 of which are included in other assets. Under the terms of existing contracts as ofDecember 28, 2014, we may be required to pay additional future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately $506,000. Acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that weconsider to be too high to be profitable, which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal, or missing business opportunities for new licenses. Additionally, as a licensee of entertainment-basedproperties we have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy, game or other family entertainment products, and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us. We anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitablysell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue tobe successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future, as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market. In the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainmentlicenses on advantageous terms, our revenues and profits may be harmed.  Our use of third-party manufacturers to producethe substantial majority of our products, as well as certain other products, presents risks to our business.  We ownand operate two manufacturing facilities, one in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts and the other in Waterford, Ireland. However, most of our products are manufactured by third-party manufacturers, the majority of which are located in China. Although,should changes be necessary, our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted, over a significant period of time, to alternative sources of supply. If we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of ourproduct line due to political, civil, labor or other factors beyond our control, including natural disasters or pandemics, our operations may be substantially disrupted, potentially for a significant period of time. This delay could significantlyreduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business while alternative sources of supply are secured.  Given that themajority of our toy manufacturing is conducted by third-party manufacturers located in China, health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in China and affecting the movement of people and products into and from Chinato our major markets, including North America and Europe, as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in China, could have a significant negative impact on our operations, revenues and earnings. Factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential significant revaluation of the Chinese Yuan, which may result in anincrease in the cost of producing products in China, labor shortages and increases in labor costs in China as well as difficulties in moving products manufactured in China out of Asia and through the ports in North America and Europe, whether due toport congestion, labor disputes, slow-downs, product regulations and/or inspections or other factors. During the period leading up to the 2014 holiday season labor disputes had a negative impact on the transportation of many goods coming from theFar East to the United States through the port the Company utilizes in California. To manage the impact of that situation we opted to transport products through a port on the east coast. However, prolonged disputes or slowdowns at the west coastport can negatively impact both the time and cost of transporting goods into the United States. Natural disasters or health pandemics impacting China can also have a significant negative impact on our business. Further, the imposition of tradesanctions or other regulations by the United States or the European Union against products imported by us from, or the loss of normal trade relations status with, China, could significantly increase our  20 Table of Contentscost of products imported into the United States or Europe and harm our business. Additionally, the suspension of the operations of a third-party manufacturer by government inspectors in Chinacould result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales.  We require our third-party manufacturers to comply withour Global Business Ethics Principles, which are designed to prevent products manufactured by or for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions. Our Global Business Ethics Principles address a number of issues, including workinghours and compensation, health and safety, and abuse and discrimination. In addition, we require that our products supplied by third-party manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including consumer andproduct safety laws in the markets where those products are sold. Hasbro has the right and exercises such right, both directly and through the use of outside monitors, to monitor compliance by our third-party manufacturers with our Global BusinessEthics Principles and other manufacturing requirements. In addition, we do quality assurance testing on our products, including products manufactured for us by third parties. Notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing ofcompliance with them, there is always a risk that one or more of our third-party manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such non-compliance. Any failure of our third-party manufacturers tocomply with labor, consumer, product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation, harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the evolution of gaming, our revenues and profitability may decline. Recognizing the critical need for increased innovation and a change in the way we go to market with gaming products in order to remainsuccessful in the gaming business in the future, we began implementing a strategy in 2011 to reinvent our gaming business. The objective of this plan was to stabilize our gaming business in 2012, and to position it to grow over thelong-term. Our strategy to drive our gaming business in the future involves substantial changes in how we market our gaming products to consumers and how we position them at retail, a focus on delivering industry leading innovation in gaming, achange in our allocation of focus across gaming brands, greater penetration of our brands into digital gaming and the successful combination of analog and digital gaming. Our strategy also involves making changes in how we design and developour gaming products. We recognize the need to provide immersive game play that is easy for consumers to learn and play in shorter periods of time, as well as offer innovative face to face, off the board and digital gamingopportunities. People are gaming in greater numbers than ever before, but the nature of gaming has and continues to evolve quickly. To be successful our gaming offerings must evolve to anticipate and meet these changes in consumergaming. Our failure to successfully implement our strategy and to keep up with the evolution of gaming could substantially harm our business, resulting in lost revenues and lost profits. Our success is critically dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees. Our officers and employees are at the heart of all of our efforts. It is their skill, innovation and hard work that drive our success. Wecompete with many other potential employers in recruiting, hiring and retaining our senior management team and our many other skilled officers and other employees around the world. There is no guarantee that we will be able to recruit, hire orretain the senior management, officers and other employees we need to succeed. Additionally, we have experienced significant changes in our workforce from our restructuring efforts and the recruitment and hiring of new skill sets required from ourchanging global business. We have added hundreds of employees in our global markets while reducing our overall workforce over the last several years. These changes in employee composition, both in terms of global distribution and in skillsets, has required changes in our business. Our loss of key management or other employees, or our inability to hire talented people with the skill sets we need for our changing business, could significantly harm our business. To remain competitive we must continuously work to increase efficiency and reduce costs, but there is no guarantee we will besuccessful in this regard.  Our business is extremely competitive, the pace of change in our industry is getting fasterand our competitors are always working to be more efficient and profitable. To compete we must continuously improve   21 Table of Contentsour processes, increase efficiency and work to reduce our expenses. To improve our profitability and competitiveness, in the fourth quarter of 2012 we implemented a global cost savingsinitiative. The objective of this initiative is to reduce our underlying operating costs by an annual gross amount of $100 million by the end of 2015. We intend to achieve this by focusing on fewer, more global brand initiatives, workforcereductions, facility consolidation and other process improvements. However, these actions are no guarantee we will achieve our cost savings goal and we may realize fewer benefits than are expected from this initiative. Our business is critically dependent on our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rightssuccessfully.  Our intellectual property, including our trademarks and tradenames, copyrights, patents, and rightsunder our license agreements and other agreements that establish our intellectual property rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, is of critical value. We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark,patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands in the United States and around the world. From time to time, third parties have challenged, and may in the future try tochallenge, our ownership of our intellectual property in the United States and around the world. In addition, our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights. We mayneed to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. Similarly, third parties may claim ownership over certain aspects of our products or other intellectualproperty. Our failure to successfully protect our intellectual property rights could significantly harm our business and competitive position.  We have a material amount of acquired product rights which, if impaired, would result in a reduction of our net earnings. Much of our intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our consolidated balance sheets. However, asof December 28, 2014, we had $324,528 of acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed products or our decision to reduce ourfocus or exit these brands may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge. Reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results. We rely on external financing, including our credit facility, to help fund our operations. If we were unable to obtain or servicesuch financing, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome, our business would be harmed. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our working capital needs, particularly those in the third and fourthquarters, we rely on our commercial paper program, revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital. We currently have a commercial paper program which, subject to market conditions, and availability under our committedrevolving credit facility, allows us to issue up to $700,000 in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a source of working capital funding and liquidity. There is no guarantee that we will be able to issue commercialpaper on favorable terms, or at all, at any given point in time.  We also have a revolving credit agreement that expires in2017, which provides for a $700,000 committed revolving credit facility and a further source of working capital funding and liquidity. This facility also supports borrowings under our commercial paper program. The credit agreement contains certainrestrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility. These restrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial, operating and strategicflexibility. In addition, our financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility. Our performance and financial condition may not meet our original expectations, causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants.Non-compliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines, a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most requiresupplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations.   22 Table of ContentsNot only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sources ofexternal financing, but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing. In times of severe economic downturn and/or distress in the credit markets, it is possible that one or more sources ofexternal financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us. In such a situation, it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities, and it might not be possible to find alternative sources offunding.  We also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to time, through the issuance of debt securities. Ourability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interest rates, and the overall condition of thefinancial and credit markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Variations in these factors could makeit difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities. The failure to receive financing on desirable terms, or at all, could damage our ability to support our future operationsor capital needs or engage in other business activities.  As of December 28, 2014, we had $1,559,895 of total principalamount of long-term debt outstanding. If we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default. There is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt onfavorable terms, or at all.  As a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation, we aresubject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future, violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business. In addition, we could be the subject of future product liabilitysuits or product recalls, which could harm our business.  As a manufacturer of consumer products, we are subject tosignificant government regulations, including, in the United States, under The Consumer Products Safety Act, The Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and The Flammable Fabrics Act, as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in ourinternational markets. In addition, certain of our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration or similar international authorities. In addition, advertising to children is subject to regulation by the Federal TradeCommission, the Federal Communications Commission and a host of other agencies globally, and the collection of information from children under the age of thirteen is subject to the provisions of the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act andother privacy laws around the world. While we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance and failure to comply with these acts could result in sanctions which couldhave a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall. While costs associated with product recalls have generally notbeen material to our business, the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant. In addition, any product recall, regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harmconsumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations.  Governmentsand regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with productsafety and consumer protection regulations. In addition, one or more of our customers might require changes in our products, such as the non-use of certain materials, in the future. Complying with any such additional regulations or requirementscould impose increased costs on our business. Similarly, increased penalties for non-compliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations. Such increased costs or penaltiescould harm our business.  As a large, multinational corporation, we are subject to a host of governmental regulationsthroughout the world, including antitrust, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, environmental regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce ourprofitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition.   23 Table of ContentsWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in jointventures, or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization.  Acquisitions and investments have been acomponent of our historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our product offerings. In making acquisitions or investments, we target companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products or offeringsand/or the ability for us to leverage our entertainment offerings. In the case of our joint venture with Discovery, we looked to partner with a company that has shown the ability to establish and operate compelling entertainment channels.Additionally, through our acquisition of a 70% interest in Backflip Studios, we looked to strengthen our mobile gaming expertise. However, we cannot be certain that the products and offerings of companies we may acquire, or acquire an interestin, will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products. In some cases, we expect that the integration of the companies that we mayacquire into our operations will create production, marketing and other operating synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and, where applicable, cost savings, operating efficiencies and other advantages. However, wecannot be certain that these synergies, efficiencies and cost savings will be realized. Even if achieved, these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization. In other cases, we may acquire or invest in companies that we believe havestrong and creative management, in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations. We cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work forus after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products or services in the future. There is no guarantee that any acquisition or investment we may make will be successful or beneficial, and acquisitions can consumesignificant amounts of management attention and other resources, which may negatively impact other aspects of our business. Failure to operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our salesor profitability.  We rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications to managemany aspects of our business, including product development, management of our supply chain, sale and delivery of our products, financial reporting and various other process transactions. We are critically dependent on the integrity, securityand consistent operations of these systems and related back-up systems. These systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, malware and other security breaches,catastrophic events such as hurricanes, fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees. The efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems,including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully. The failure of our information systems to perform asdesigned or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business, require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability. If our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed. We maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world. This data relates to all aspects of ourbusiness, including current and future products and entertainment under development, and also contains certain customer, consumer, supplier, partner and employee data. We maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data, butnotwithstanding such protective measures, there is a risk of intrusion or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data. In addition, we provide confidential and proprietary information to our third-party businesspartners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business. While we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data, and where applicable, that they will take steps toassure the protections of such data by third parties, nonetheless those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of such data. Any compromise of the confidential data of our customers, consumers,suppliers, partners, employees or ourselves, or failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of or damage to this data through   24 Table of Contentsbreach of our information technology systems or other means could substantially disrupt our operations, harm our customers, consumers and other business partners, damage our reputation, violateapplicable laws and regulations and subject us to additional costs and liabilities and loss of business that could be material. From time to time, we are involved in litigation, arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which couldentail significant expense.  As is the case with many large multinational corporations, we are subject, from time totime, to regulatory investigations, litigation and arbitration disputes, including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of products that have been or may be developed by us as well as claims by thirdparties that our products infringe upon or misuse such third parties property or rights. Because the outcome of litigation, arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome of any ofthese matters could entail significant cost for us and harm our business. The fact that we operate in significant numbers of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with alarge number of varying legal and regulatory requirements. Any successful claim against us could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have a material amount of goodwill which, if it becomes impaired, would result in a reduction in our net earnings. Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire.Goodwill is not amortized and is required to be periodically evaluated for impairment. At December 28, 2014, $593,438, or 13.1%, of our total assets represented goodwill. Declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our reportingunits, which could result in a write-down of our goodwill and consequently harm our results of operations.   "

.  Forward-Looking Information and Risk Factors
 That May Affect Future Results  From time to time, including in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our annual report to shareholders, we publish forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private SecuritiesLitigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may relate to such matters as our business and marketing strategies, anticipated financial performance or business prospects in future periods, including with respect to ourplanned cost savings initiative, expected technological and product developments, the expected content of and timing for   10 Table of Contentsscheduled new product introductions or our expectations concerning the future acceptance of products by customers, the content and timing of planned entertainment releases including motionpictures, television and digital products; and marketing and promotional efforts, research and development activities, liquidity, and similar matters. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. The PrivateSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. These statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as anticipate, believe, could,expect, intend, looking forward, may, planned, potential, should, will and would or any variations of words with similar meanings. We notethat a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed or anticipated in our forward-looking statements. The factors listed below are illustrative andother risks and uncertainties may arise as are or may be detailed from time to time in our public announcements and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K. We undertake no obligation to make anyrevisions to the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in our annual report to shareholders to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of the filing of this report. Unless otherwise specificallyindicated, all dollar or share amounts herein are expressed in thousands of dollars or shares, except for per share amounts. We are focusing our global efforts around our brand architecture, which includes a heightened emphasis and reliance on ourfranchise and partner brands.  We have made a strategic decision to focus on fewer, larger global brands as we buildour business. We are moving away from SKU making behaviors, which involve building a large number of products across many brands, towards global brand building with an emphasis on our franchise and partner brands, which we view as having thelargest global potential. As we concentrate our efforts on a more select group of brands, our future success depends to a greater extent on our ability to successfully develop those brands across our brand blue print and to maintain and extendthe reach and relevance of those brands to global consumers in wide array of markets. In 2013 revenues from our seven franchise brands, LITTLEST PET SHOP, MAGIC: THE GATHERING, MONOPOLY, NERF, MY LITTLE PONY, PLAY-DOH and TRANSFORMERS, totaled44% of our aggregate net revenues. Our key partner brands, such as DISNEY, MARVEL, LUCASFILM, SESAME STREET and ROVIO, also constitute a significant portion of our overall business. Together our franchise and partner brands are critical to ourbusiness. If we are unable to successfully execute this strategy and to maintain and develop our franchise and key partner brands in the future, such that our product offerings based on these brands are not sought after by consumers, our revenuesand profits will decline and our business performance will be harmed.  Consumer interests change rapidly, making itdifficult to design and develop products which will be popular with children and families.  The interests of childrenand families evolve extremely quickly and can change dramatically from year to year. To be successful we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment content, products and play patterns which will capture childrens and familiesinterests and imagination and quickly develop and introduce innovative products which can compete successfully for consumers limited time, attention and spending. This challenge is more difficult with the ever increasing utilization oftechnology and digital media in entertainment offerings, and the increasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers. Evolving consumer tastes and shifting interests, coupled with an ever changing and expanding pipeline of entertainmentand consumer properties and products which compete for childrens and families interest and acceptance, create an environment in which some products can fail to achieve consumer acceptance, and other products can be popular during acertain period of time but then be rapidly replaced. As a result, individual child and family entertainment products and properties often have short consumer life cycles. If we devote time and resources to developing entertainment and productsthat consumers do not find interesting enough to buy in significant quantities to be profitable to us, our revenues and profits may decline and our business performance may be damaged. Additionally, our business is increasingly global and depends on interest in and acceptance of our child and family entertainment productsand properties by consumers in diverse markets around the world with different   11 Table of Contentstastes and preferences. As such, our success depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences in multiple markets and geographies and todesign product and entertainment offerings that can achieve popularity globally over a broad and diverse consumer audience. The challenge of continuously developing and offering products that are sought after by children is compounded by thesophistication of todays children and the increasing array of technology and entertainment offerings available to them.  Children are increasingly utilizing electronic offerings such as tablet devices and mobile phones and they are expanding their interests to a wider array of innovative, technology-driven entertainmentproducts and digital and social media offerings at younger and younger ages. Our products compete with the offerings of consumer electronics companies, digital media and social media companies. To meet this challenge we, and our competitors,are designing and marketing products which incorporate increasing technology, seek to combine digital and analog play, and capitalize on new play patterns and increased consumption of digital and social media. With the increasing array of competitive entertainment offerings, there is no guarantee that:     Any of our brands, products or product lines will achieve popularity or continue to be popular;     Any property for which we have a significant license will achieve or sustain popularity;     Any new products or product lines we introduce will be considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate market acceptance; or     Any products life cycle or sales quantities will be sufficient to permit us to profitably recover our development, manufacturing, marketing,royalties (including royalty advances and guarantees) and other costs of producing, marketing and selling the product.  The childrens and family entertainment industry is highly competitive and the barriers to entry are low. If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors or withour retailers private label toy products our revenues, market share and profitability could decline.  Thechildrens and family entertainment industry is, and will continue to be, highly competitive. We compete in the United States and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers, marketers, and sellers of analog toys andgames, digital gaming products, digital media, products which combine analog and digital play, and other entertainment and consumer products, as well as with retailers who offer such products under their own private labels. We face competitorswho are constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends, seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase. In addition to existing competitors, the barriers to entry for new participants in the childrens and family entertainment industryare low, and the increasing importance of digital media, and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest, has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets, and has broadened the array of companieswe compete with. New participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time. These existing and new competitorsmay be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences. Our competitors products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products, lower our revenues and lowerour profitability.  In recent years, retailers have also developed their own private-label products that directly compete withthe products of traditional manufacturers. Some retail chains that are our customers sell private-label childrens and family entertainment products designed, manufactured and branded by the retailers themselves. These products may besold at prices lower than our prices for comparable products, which may result in lower purchases of our products by these retailers and may reduce our market share.   12 Table of ContentsAn inability to develop and introduce planned products, product lines and new brandsin a timely and cost-effective manner may damage our business.  In developing products, product lines and new brands wehave anticipated dates for the associated product and brand introductions. When we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a particular product, product line or brand at a certain time in the future those expectations are based oncompleting the associated development, implementation, and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule. There is no guarantee that we will be able to manufacture, source and ship new or continuing products in atimely manner and on a cost-effective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands. This risk is heightened by our customers compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business. The risk is also exacerbated by theincreasing sophistication of many of the products we are designing, and brands we are developing in terms of combining digital and analog technologies, utilizing digital media to a greater degree, and providing greater innovation and productdifferentiation. Unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process, significant increases in the planned cost of development, or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products and new brands may cause the introduction datefor products to be later than anticipated or, in some situations, may cause a product or new brand introduction to be discontinued.  United States, global and regional economic downturns that negatively impact the retail and credit markets, or that otherwise damage the financial health of our retail customers and consumers, canharm our business and financial performance.  We design, manufacture and market a wide variety of entertainment andconsumer products worldwide through sales to our retail customers and directly to consumers. Our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending in the markets in which we operate. Recessions, creditcrises and other economic downturns, or disruptions in credit markets, in the United States and in other markets in which our products are marketed and sold can result in lower levels of economic activity, lower employment levels, less consumerdisposable income, and lower consumer confidence. Similarly, reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers, such as their homes or stock market investments, can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power. Any of these factorscan reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products. This in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability.  In addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our products during times of economic difficulty, in an effort to maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price of ourproducts, increase our promotional spending and/or sales allowances, or take other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products. Those steps may lower our net revenues or increase our costs, thereby decreasing our operatingmargins and lowering our profitability.  Challenging market conditions in certain developed economies, such as in theUnited States, Canada, Australia and certain Western European countries, make it more difficult for us to succeed.  Ourfuture success in the United States, Canada, Australia, Europe and other developed economies is impacted by market conditions. For example, a European sovereign debt crisis or other significant negative shock to European markets could lead to arecession in Europe, which may negatively impact consumers and in turn, sales of our products in the European markets. Similar negative events impacting the market in the United States and other developed economies may harm our business. Many categories within the toy, game and family entertainment industries in the United States, Canada, Australia, certainWestern European countries and other developed economies have not grown, or in some cases have even declined, in recent years. In addition, many current economic predictions suggest developed economies may grow only modestly, if at all, in thenext several years. We have substantial business in developed economies, and these markets represent a majority of our current product sales. It is more difficult for us to grow, or even maintain, our business when the overall market in certain ofthe major countries we serve is not growing or is declining. To succeed in a market that is stable or declining, we must maintain or gain market share from our competitors, which is more difficult than growing in an expanding market. Aslong as economic conditions in the developed economies remain difficult, this will be an additional challenge for the Company.   13 Table of ContentsAn increasing portion of our business is expected to come from emerging markets, andgrowing business in emerging markets presents additional challenges.  We expect an increasing portion of our netrevenues to come from emerging markets, including Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia. In 2013 revenues in emerging markets constituted approximately 14% of our net revenues, up from only 6% of our net revenues in 2010. Over time, we expectour emerging market net revenues to continue to grow both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall business as one of our key business strategies is to increase our presence in emerging and underserved internationalmarkets. Operating in an increasing number of markets, each with its own unique consumer preferences and business climates, presents additional challenges that we must meet. In addition to the need to successfully anticipate and servedifferent global consumer preferences and interests, sales and operations in emerging markets that we have entered, may enter, or may increase our presence in, are subject to other risks associated with international operations, including:     Complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies and the evolution of lawsand regulations that impact our product offerings and related enforcement;      Potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross border transactions which may impact our income tax expense;     Difficulties understanding the retail climate, consumer trends, local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be quitedifferent from the United States;      Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another, including port congestion, strikes and other transportation delays andinterruptions; and      The imposition of tariffs, quotas, or other protectionist measures. Because of the importance of our emerging market net revenues, our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if any ofthe risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our emerging market business. Our business depends in large part on the success of our key partner brands and on our ability to maintain and extend solidrelationships with our key partners.  As part of our strategy, in addition to developing and marketing products basedon properties we own or control, we also seek to obtain licenses enabling us to develop and market products based on popular entertainment properties owned by third parties.  We currently have in-licenses to several successful entertainment properties, including MARVEL and STAR WARS, owned by Disney as well as SESAME STREET and ROVIO. These licenses typically havemulti-year terms and provide us with the right to market and sell designated classes of products. In recent years our sales of products under the MARVEL, STAR WARS, SESAME STREET and ROVIO licenses have been highly significant to ourbusiness. If we fail to meet our contractual commitments and/or any of these licenses were to terminate and not be renewed, or the popularity of any of these licensed properties was to significantly decline, our business would be damaged and wewould need to successfully develop and market other products to replace the products previously offered under license.  Ourlicense to the MARVEL property is granted from Marvel Entertainment, LLC and Marvel Characters B.V. (together Marvel). Our license to the STAR WARS property is granted by Lucas Licensing Ltd. and Lucasfilm Ltd. (togetherLucas). Both Marvel and Lucas are owned by The Walt Disney Company.  Entertainment is an increasinglyimportant success factor for our brand awareness and brand building.  Entertainment media, in forms such as television,motion pictures, digital products, DVD releases and other media, have become increasingly important platforms for consumers to experience our owned and partner brands and the success, or lack of success, of such media efforts can significantlyimpact the demand for our products and our financial success. We spend considerable resources in designing and developing products in conjunction   14 Table of Contentswith planned media releases. Not only our efforts, but the efforts of third parties, heavily impact the timing of media development, release dates and the ultimate consumer interest in andsuccess of these media efforts.  The ultimate timing and success of such projects is critically dependent on the efforts andschedules of our licensors, and studio and media partners. We do not fully control when or if any particular motion picture projects will be greenlit, developed or released, and our licensors or media partners may change their plans withrespect to projects and release dates or cancel development all together. This can make it difficult for us to get feature films developed, plan future entertainment slates and to successfully develop and market products in conjunction withfuture motion picture and other media releases, given the lengthy lead times involved in product development and successful marketing efforts.  When we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases, those statements are based on our current plans and expectations. Unforeseen factors may increase the cost of thesereleases, delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation. Any delay or cancellation of planned product development work, introductions, or media support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business. Lack of sufficient consumer interest in entertainment media for which we offer products can harm our business. Motion pictures, television, digital products or other media for which we develop products may not be as popular with consumers as weanticipated. While it is difficult to anticipate what products may be sought after by consumers, it can be even more difficult to properly predict the popularity of media efforts and properties given the broad array of competing offerings. Ifour and our partners media efforts fail to garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance, our revenues and the financial return from such efforts will be harmed.  Hub Network, our cable television joint venture with Discovery Communications, Inc. in the United States, competes with a number of other childrens television networks for viewers, advertisingrevenue and distribution fees. There is no guarantee that Hub Network will be successful. Similarly, Hasbro Studios programming distributed internationally and Backflip Studios digital products compete with content from many otherparties. Lack of consumer interest in and acceptance of content developed by Hasbro Studios and Backflip Studios, or other content appearing on Hub Network, and products related to that content, could significantly harm our business. Similarly, ourbusiness could be harmed by greater than expected costs, or unexpected delays or difficulties, associated with our investment in Hub Network, such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or in building advertising revenues for HubNetwork. During 2013 the Company spent $41,325 for programming developed by Hasbro Studios and anticipates that it will continue spending at comparable levels in 2014 and future years. At December 29, 2013, $321,876, or 7.3%, of our total assets, represented our investment in Hub Network. If Hub Network does notachieve success, or if there are subsequent declines in the success or profitability of the channel, then our investment may become impaired, which could result in a write-down through net earnings. Our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend, in large part, on our sales during the relativelybrief holiday shopping season. This seasonality is exacerbated by retailers quick response inventory management techniques.  Sales of our toys, games and other family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from September through December inanticipation of the holiday season, including Christmas. This seasonality has increased over time, as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques. Customers are timingtheir orders so that they are being filled by suppliers, such as us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. For toys, games and other family entertainment products which we produce, a majority of retail sales for the entire year generallyoccur in the fourth quarter, close to the holiday season. As a consequence, the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from September through December, as our customers do not want to maintain large on-hand inventories throughoutthe year ahead of consumer demand. While these techniques reduce a retailers investment in inventory, they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carryingcosts to the supplier.   15 Table of ContentsThe level of inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resultingin lower revenues for us. If we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional products to fully meet consumerdemand. Additionally, the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce our sales and harm our financialperformance. This seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital, mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products duringthe holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers. Our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand, resulting in our underproducing popular items and/or overproducing less popular items, would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations. In addition, as a result of the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly and adversely affected, in amanner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year, by unforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or economic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our keyselling season, or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods, particularly from the Far East, during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season. The concentration of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policiesor patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us.  We depend upon a relatively small retailcustomer base to sell the majority of our products. For the fiscal year ended December 29, 2013, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Toys R Us, Inc. and Target Corporation, accounted for approximately 16%, 10% and 9%, respectively, of ourconsolidated net revenues and our five largest customers, including Wal-Mart, Toys R Us and Target, in the aggregate accounted for approximately 39% of our consolidated net revenues. In the U.S. and Canada segment, approximately 61%of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers. If one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing business with us, significantly reduce theamount of their purchases from us, favor competitors or new entrants, increase their direct competition with us by expanding their private-label business, change their purchasing patterns, alter the manner in which they promote our products or theresources they devote to promoting and selling our products, or return substantial amounts of our products, it could significantly harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. Customers make no binding long-term commitments to usregarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders. Any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products, and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for ourproducts. In addition, increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there wereless consolidation among our customers. Furthermore, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and profitability. Part of our strategy to remain relevant to children and families is to offer innovative products incorporating greater technologyand which combine digital and analog play. These products can be more difficult and expensive to design and manufacture, margins on some portion of these products are lower than more traditional toys and games and such products may have short lifespans.  As children have grown older younger and have otherwise become interested in more and moresophisticated and adult products, such as video games, consumer electronics and social and digital media, at younger and younger ages, we have sought to keep our products relevant and interesting for these consumers. One initiative we have pursuedto capture the interest of children is to offer innovative childrens electronic toy and game products. Increasing the marriage between digital and analog gaming and increasing the technology in our gaming products is another key for our futurestrategy. These electronic and digital products, if successful, can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase our sales. However, childrens electronic and digital products, in addition to the risks associated withour other family entertainment products, also face certain additional risks.   16 Table of ContentsOur costs for designing, developing and producing electronic and digital products, orproducts that combine digital and analog technology, tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products, such as board games and action figures. The ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient sales quantities and toreflect higher costs in higher prices is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment products, and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions. As a consequence, our margins on the sales of theseproducts can be lower than for more traditional products and we can face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs. Additionally, designing, developing and producing electronic and digital products requires differentcompetencies and follows different timelines than traditional toys and games. Delays in the design, development or production of electronic or digital products incorporated into or associated with traditional toys and games could have asignificant impact on our ability to successfully offer such projects. In addition, the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than for our other products.This pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games.  Our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the United States subject us to risks associated with international operations. We operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the United States. For the year ended December 29, 2013, ournet revenues from the International segment comprised approximately 46% of our total consolidated net revenues. We expect our sales to international customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues. In fact, over time, weexpect our international sales and operations to continue to grow both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall business as one of our key business strategies is to increase our presence in emerging and underserved international markets.Additionally, as we discuss below, we utilize third-party manufacturers located in the Far East to produce the substantial majority of our products, and we have a manufacturing facility in Ireland. These sales and manufacturing operations, includingoperations in emerging markets that we have entered, may enter, or may increase our presence in, are subject to the risks associated with international operations, including:     Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;      Limitations on the repatriation of earnings;      Potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross border transactions which may impact income tax expense;     Political instability, civil unrest and economic instability;     Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;     Complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies and the evolution of lawsand regulations and related enforcement;      Difficulties understanding the retail climate, consumer trends, local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be quitedifferent from the United States;      Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and cost in recovering therefrom;     Transportation delays and interruptions;      Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another, including port congestion, strikes and other transportation delays andinterruptions;      Increased investment and operational complexity to make our products compatible with systems in various countries and compliant with local laws;     Changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing business internationally; and     The imposition of tariffs, quotas, or other protectionist measures.   17 Table of ContentsBecause of the importance of our international sales and international sourcing ofmanufacturing to our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business. Other economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we operate, including rising commodity and fuelprices, higher labor costs, increased transportation costs, outbreaks of public health pandemics or other diseases, or third party conduct could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products, and lower our revenues, margins andprofitability.  Various economic and public health conditions can impact our ability to manufacture and deliverproducts in a timely and cost-effective manner, or can otherwise have a significant negative impact on our revenues, profitability and business.  Significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers, such as gasoline, home heating fuels, or groceries, may reduce household spending on the discretionary branded playentertainment products we offer. As we discussed above, weakened economic conditions, lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products. Economic conditions may also benegatively impacted by terrorist attacks, wars and other conflicts, natural disasters, increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs, or the prospect of such events. Such a weakened economic and business climate, as well as consumeruncertainty created by such a climate, could harm our revenues and profitability.  Our success and profitability not onlydepend on consumer demand for our products, but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit. Rising fuel and raw material prices, for paperboard and other components such as resin used inplastics or electronic components, increased transportation costs, and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products, which in turn may reduceour margins, reduce our profitability and harm our business.  Other conditions, such as the unavailability of sufficientquantities of electrical components, may impede our ability to manufacture, source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis. Additional factors outside of our control could further delay our products or increase the cost we pay toproduce such products. For example, work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic, a natural disaster or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts, all could impact our ability to manufacture ordeliver product. Any of these factors could result in product delays, increased costs and/or lost sales for our products. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance. Our global operations mean we produce and buy products, and sell products, in many different jurisdictions with many differentcurrencies. As a result, if the exchange rate between the United States dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes, our financial results as reported in U.S. dollars,may be meaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected. As an example, if the dollar appreciates 10% relative to a local currency for an international market in which we had $200 million of netrevenues, the dollar value of those sales, as they are translated into U.S. dollars, would decrease by $20 million in our consolidated financial results. As such, we would recognize a $20 million decrease in our net revenues, even ifthe actual level of sales in the foreign market had not changed. Similarly, our expenses in foreign markets can be significantly impacted, in U.S. dollar terms, by exchange rates, meaning the profitability of our business in U.S. dollarterms can be negatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control.   18 Table of ContentsWe may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has lessmarket appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties.  In addition to designing and developing products based on our own brands, we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests by producing products based on popular entertainment properties developed bythird parties and licensed to us. The success of entertainment properties for which we have a license, such as MARVEL, STAR WARS, SESAME STREET or ROVIO related products, can significantly affect our revenues and profitability. If we produce a lineof products based on a movie or television series, the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering. In addition, competition in our industry for access toentertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure, maintain, and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms, if at all, and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design, develop and marketsuccessful products based on these properties.  The license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us topay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial, and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales, which could result in write-offs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results ofoperations. At December 29, 2013, we had $294,991 of prepaid royalties, $152,459 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $142,532 of which are included in other assets. Under the terms of existing contracts as ofDecember 29, 2013, we may be required to pay additional future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately $332,000. Acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that weconsider to be too high to be profitable, which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal, or missing business opportunities for new licenses. Additionally, as a licensee of entertainment-basedproperties we have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy, game or other family entertainment products, and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us. We anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitablysell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue tobe successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future, as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market. In the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainmentlicenses on advantageous terms, our revenues and profits may be harmed.  Our use of third-party manufacturers to producethe substantial majority of our products, as well as certain other products, presents risks to our business.  We ownand operate two manufacturing facilities, one in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts and the other in Waterford, Ireland. However, most of our products are manufactured by third-party manufacturers, the majority of which are located in China. Although,should changes be necessary, our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted, over a significant period of time, to alternative sources of supply. If we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of ourproduct line due to political, civil, labor or other factors beyond our control, including natural disasters or pandemics, our operations may be substantially disrupted, potentially for a significant period of time. This delay could significantlyreduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business while alternative sources of supply are secured.  Given that themajority of our toy manufacturing is conducted by third-party manufacturers located in China, health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in China and affecting the movement of people and products into and from Chinato our major markets, including North America and Europe, as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in China, could have a significant negative impact on our operations, revenues and earnings. Factors that couldnegatively affect our   19 Table of Contentsbusiness include a potential significant revaluation of the Chinese Yuan, which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products in China, labor shortages and increases in labor costsin China as well as difficulties in moving products manufactured in China out of Asia and through the ports in North America and Europe, whether due to port congestion, labor disputes, product regulations and/or inspections or other factors, andnatural disasters or health pandemics impacting China. Also, the imposition of trade sanctions or other regulations by the United States or the European Union against products imported by us from, or the loss of normal trade relationsstatus with, China, could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the United States or Europe and harm our business. Additionally, the suspension of the operations of a third-party manufacturer by government inspectors in Chinacould result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales.  We require our third-party manufacturers to comply withour Global Business Ethics Principles, which are designed to prevent products manufactured by or for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions. Our Global Business Ethics Principles address a number of issues, including workinghours and compensation, health and safety, and abuse and discrimination. In addition, we require that our products supplied by third-party manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including consumer andproduct safety laws in the markets where those products are sold. Hasbro has the right and exercises such right, both directly and through the use of outside monitors, to monitor compliance by our third-party manufacturers with our Global BusinessEthics Principles and other manufacturing requirements. In addition, we do quality assurance testing on our products, including products manufactured for us by third parties. Notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing ofcompliance with them, there is always a risk that one or more of our third-party manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such non-compliance. Any failure of our third-party manufacturers tocomply with labor, consumer, product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation, harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the evolution of gaming, our revenues and profitability may decline. Recognizing the critical need for increased innovation and a change in the way we go to market with gaming products in order to remainsuccessful in the gaming business in the future, we began implementing a strategy in 2011 to reinvent our gaming business. The objective of this plan was to stabilize our gaming business in 2012, and to position it to grow in 2013 andbeyond. Our strategy to drive our gaming business in the future involves substantial changes in how we market our gaming products to consumers and how we position them at retail, a focus on delivering industry leading innovation in gaming, achange in our allocation of focus across gaming brands, greater penetration of our brands into digital gaming and the successful combination of analog and digital gaming. Our strategy also involves making changes in how we design and developour gaming products. We recognize the need to provide immersive game play that is easy for consumers to learn and play in shorter periods of time, as well as offer innovative face to face, off the board and digital gamingopportunities. People are gaming in greater numbers than ever before, but the nature of gaming has and continues to evolve quickly. To be successful our gaming offerings must evolve to anticipate and meet these changes in consumergaming. Our failure to successfully implement our strategy and to keep up with the evolution of gaming could substantially harm our business, resulting in lost revenues and lost profits. Our success is critically dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees. Our officers and employees are at the heart of all of our branded play efforts. It is their skill, innovation and hard work that drive oursuccess. We compete with many other potential employers in recruiting, hiring and retaining our senior management team and our many other skilled officers and other employees. There is no guarantee that we will be able to recruit, hire or retain thesenior management, officers and other employees we need to succeed. Additionally, we have experienced significant changes in our workforce from our restructuring efforts and the recruitment and hiring of new skill sets required from our changingglobal business. We have added hundreds of employees in our global markets while reducing our overall workforce over the last several years. These changes in employee composition, both in terms of global distribution and in skill sets, hasrequired   20 Table of Contentschanges in our business. Our loss of key management or other employees, or our inability to hire talented people with the skill sets we need for our changing business, could significantlyharm our business.  To remain competitive we must continuously work to increase efficiency and reduce costs, but thereis no guarantee we will be successful in this regard.  Our business is extremely competitive, the pace of change in ourindustry is getting faster and our competitors are always working to be more efficient and profitable. To compete we must continuously improve our processes, increase efficiency and work to reduce our expenses. To improve our profitabilityand competitiveness, in the fourth quarter of 2012 we implemented a global cost savings initiative. The objective of this initiative is to reduce our operating costs by an annual gross amount of $100 million by the end of 2015. We intend toachieve this by focusing on fewer, more global brand initiatives, workforce reductions, facility consolidation and other process improvements. However, these actions are no guarantee we will achieve our cost savings goal and we may realizefewer benefits than are expected from this initiative.  We rely on external financing, including our credit facility, tohelp fund our operations. If we were unable to obtain or service such financing, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome, our business would be harmed. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our working capital needs, particularly those in the third and fourthquarters, we rely on our commercial paper program, revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital. We currently have a commercial paper program which, subject to market conditions, and availability under our committedrevolving credit facility, allows us to issue up to $700,000 in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a source of working capital funding and liquidity. There is no guarantee that we will be able to issue commercialpaper on favorable terms, or at all, at any given point in time.  We also have a revolving credit agreement that expires in2017, which provides for a $700,000 committed revolving credit facility and a further source of working capital funding and liquidity. This facility also supports borrowings under our commercial paper program. The credit agreement contains certainrestrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility. These restrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial, operating and strategicflexibility. In addition, our financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility. Our performance and financial condition may not meet our original expectations, causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants.Non-compliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines, a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most requiresupplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations.  Not only may our individual financial performanceimpact our ability to access sources of external financing, but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing. In times of severe economic downturn and/or distress in the credit markets, it ispossible that one or more sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us. In such a situation, it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities, and it might not be possibleto find alternative sources of funding.  We also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to time, through theissuance of debt securities. Our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interest rates, and theoverall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Variations inthese factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities. The failure to receive financing on desirable terms, or at all, could damage our ability tosupport our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities.   21 Table of ContentsAs of December 29, 2013, we had $1,384,895 of total principal amount of long-term debtoutstanding, including our 6.125% Notes which are due in May of 2014, which include principal amounts of $425,000. If we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt orface default. There is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms, or at all.  As amanufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation, we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future, violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harmour business. In addition, we could be the subject of future product liability suits or product recalls, which could harm our business.  As a manufacturer of consumer products, we are subject to significant government regulations, including, in the United States, under The Consumer Products Safety Act, The Federal Hazardous Substances Act,and The Flammable Fabrics Act, as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our international markets. In addition, certain of our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration or similar internationalauthorities. In addition, advertising to children is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and a host of other agencies globally, and the collection of information from children under the age ofthirteen is subject to the provisions of the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act. While we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance and failure to complywith these acts could result in sanctions which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall. Whilecosts associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business, the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant. In addition, any product recall,regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations.  Governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future and may alsoincrease the penalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations. In addition, one or more of our customers might require changes in our products, such as the non-use of certain materials, in the future. Complyingwith any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business. Similarly, increased penalties for non-compliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply withsuch regulations. Such increased costs or penalties could harm our business.  As a large, multinational corporation, we aresubject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world, including antitrust, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, environmental regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Complying with these regulationsimposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition. Our business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully.In addition, we have a material amount of acquired product rights which, if impaired, would result in a reduction of our net earnings.  Our intellectual property, including our license agreements and other agreements that establish our ownership rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, is of great value. Werely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands in the United States and around the world. From time to time, thirdparties have challenged, and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our intellectual property in the United States and around the world. In addition, our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products orinfringing on our intellectual property rights. We may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. Our failure to protect our intellectual propertyrights could harm our business and competitive position. Much of our   22 Table of Contentsintellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our consolidated balance sheets. However, as of December 29, 2013, we had $375,999 of acquired product andlicensing rights included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed products or our decision to reduce our focus or exit these brands may impact our ability to recover thecarrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge. Reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results.  We may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures, or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization. Acquisitions and investments have been a component of our historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify ourproduct offerings. In making acquisitions or investments, we target companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products or offerings and/or the ability for us to leverage our entertainment offerings. In the case of our jointventure with Discovery, we looked to partner with a company that has shown the ability to establish and operate compelling entertainment channels. Additionally, through our acquisition of a 70% interest in Backflip Studios, we looked to strengthenour mobile gaming expertise. However, we cannot be certain that the products and offerings of companies we may acquire, or acquire an interest in, will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquiredcompanies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products. In some cases, we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production, marketing and other operating synergieswhich will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and, where applicable, cost savings, operating efficiencies and other advantages. However, we cannot be certain that these synergies, efficiencies and cost savings will be realized. Even ifachieved, these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization. In other cases, we may acquire or invest in companies that we believe have strong and creative management, in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously ratherthan fully integrating them into our operations. We cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products or services inthe future.  Failure to operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt ourbusiness or reduce our sales or profitability.  We rely extensively on various information technology systems andsoftware applications to manage many aspects of our business, including management of our supply chain, sale and delivery of our products and various other process transactions. We are dependent on the integrity, security and consistentoperations of these systems and related back-up systems. These systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events such ashurricanes, fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees. The efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems, including our ability to operatethem effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully. The failure of our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement andoperate them effectively could disrupt our business, require significant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability.  If our electronic data is compromised our business could be significantly harmed.  We maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around the world. This data relates to all aspects of our business and also contains certain customer and consumer data. Wemaintain systems and processes designed to protect this data, but notwithstanding such protective measures, there is a risk of intrusion or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data. In addition, we provideconfidential and proprietary information to our third-party business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business. While we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place toprotect such data, and where applicable, that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties, nonetheless those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the  23 Table of Contentsprotection of such data. Any compromise of the confidential data of our customers, our consumers, or ourselves, failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of this data could disrupt our operations,damage our reputation, violate applicable laws and regulations and subject us to additional costs and liabilities that could be material.  From time to time, we are involved in litigation, arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense. As is the case with many large multinational corporations, we are subject, from time to time, to regulatory investigations, litigation andarbitration disputes, including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of products that have been or may be developed by us. Because the outcome of litigation, arbitration and regulatory investigations isinherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant cost for us and harm our business. The fact that we operate in significant numbers of international markets also increases the riskthat we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements. Any successful claim against us could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results ofoperations.  We have a material amount of goodwill which, if it becomes impaired, would result in a reduction in our netearnings.  Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets weacquire. Goodwill is not amortized and is required to be periodically evaluated for impairment. At December 29, 2013, $594,321, or 13.5%, of our total assets represented goodwill. Declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of ourreporting units, which could result in a write-down of our goodwill and consequently harm our results of operations.   "

The interests of children and families evolve extremely quickly andcan change dramatically from year to year. To be successful we must correctly anticipate the types of entertainment content, products and play patterns which will capture childrens and families interests and imagination and quicklydevelop innovative products which can compete successfully for consumers limited time, attention and spending. This challenge is more difficult with the ever increasing utilization of technology and digital media in entertainment offerings,and the increasing breadth of entertainment available to consumers. Evolving consumer tastes, coupled with an ever changing and expanding pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for childrens andfamilies interest and acceptance, create an environment in which some products can fail to achieve consumer acceptance, and other products can be popular during a certain period of time but then be rapidly replaced. As a result, individualfamily entertainment products and properties often have short consumer life cycles. If we devote time and resources to developing entertainment and products that consumers do not find interesting enough to buy in significant quantities to beprofitable to us, our revenues and profits will decline and our business performance will be damaged.  Additionally, ourbusiness is increasingly global and depends on interest in and acceptance of our entertainment and consumer product offerings by consumers in diverse markets around the world with different tastes and preferences. As such, our success depends on ourability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences in multiple markets and geographies and to design product offerings that can achieve popularity globally over a broad and diverse consumer audience. The challenge of continuously developing and offering products that are sought after by children is compounded by thesophistication of todays children and the increasing array of entertainment offerings available to them. Children are expanding their interests to a wider array of innovative, technology-driven entertainment products and digital and socialmedia offerings at younger and younger ages. Our products compete with the offerings of consumer electronics companies, digital media and social media companies. To meet this challenge we, and our competitors, are designing and marketing productswhich incorporate increasing technology, seek to combine digital and analog play, and capitalize on new play patterns and increased consumption of digital and social media.  With the increasing array of competitive entertainment offerings, there is no guarantee that:      Any of our brands, products or product lines will achieve popularity or continue to be popular;     Any property for which we have a significant license will achieve or sustain popularity;     Any new products or product lines we introduce will be considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate market acceptance; or     Any products life cycle or sales quantities will be sufficient to permit us to profitably recover our development, manufacturing, marketing,royalties (including royalty advances and guarantees) and other costs of producing, marketing and selling the product.  The childrens and family entertainment industry is highly competitive and the barriers to entry are low. If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our revenues,market share and profitability could decline.  The childrens and family entertainment industry is, and willcontinue to be, highly competitive. We compete in the United States and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers, marketers, and sellers of analog toys and games, digital gaming products, digital media, products whichcombine analog and digital play, and other entertainment and consumer products, as well as with retailers. We face competitors who   11 Table of Contentsare constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends, seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products forconsumer acceptance and purchase.  In addition to existing competitors, the barriers to entry for new participants in thechildrens and family entertainment industry are low, and the increasing importance of digital media, and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest, has further increased the ability for new participants to enter ourmarkets, and has broadened the array of companies we compete with. New participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very shortperiod of time. These existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences. Our competitors products may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demandfor our products, lower our revenues and lower our profitability.  An inability to develop and introduce planned newbrands, products and product lines in a timely and cost-effective manner may damage our business.  In developing newbrands, products and product lines, we have anticipated dates for the associated product introductions. When we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a particular product or product line at a certain time in the future thoseexpectations are based on completing the associated development, implementation, and marketing work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule. There is no guarantee that we will be able to manufacture, source and ship new orcontinuing products in a timely manner and on a cost-effective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands. This risk is heightened by our customers compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business. The risk is alsoexacerbated by the increasing sophistication of many of the products we are designing, in terms of combining digital and analog technologies, utilizing digital media to a greater degree, and providing greater innovation and product differentiation.Unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process, significant increases in the planned cost of development, or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products may cause the introduction date for products to be later thananticipated or, in some situations, may cause a product introduction to be discontinued.  United States, global andregional economic downturns that negatively impact the retail and credit markets, or that otherwise damage the financial health of our retail customers and consumers, can harm our business and financial performance. We design, manufacture and market a wide variety of entertainment and consumer products worldwide through sales to our retail customersand directly to consumers. Our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending in the markets in which we operate. Recessions, credit crises and other economic downturns, or disruptions in credit markets, in theUnited States and in other markets in which our products are marketed and sold can result in lower levels of economic activity, lower employment levels, less consumer disposable income, and lower consumer confidence. Similarly, reductions in thevalue of key assets held by consumers, such as their homes or stock market investments, can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power. Any of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our products. Thisin turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability.  In addition to experiencing potentiallylower revenues from our products during times of economic difficulty, in an effort to maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price of our products, increase our promotional spending and/or sales allowances, or take other steps toencourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products. Those steps may lower our net revenues or increase our costs, thereby decreasing our operating margins and lowering our profitability.   12 Table of ContentsChallenging market conditions in certain developed markets, such as in the UnitedStates and certain Western European countries, make it more difficult for us to succeed.  Our future success in theUnited States and Europe is impacted by market conditions. A European sovereign debt crisis or other significant negative shock to European markets could lead to a recession in Europe, which may negatively impact consumers and in turn, sales of ourproducts in the European markets. Similar negative events impacting the market in the United States may harm our business. Many components of the toy, game and family entertainment industries in the United States and certain Western European countries, have notgrown, or in some cases have even contracted, in recent years. These markets represent a majority of our current product sales. It is more difficult for us to grow, or even maintain, our business when the overall market in certain of the majorcountries we serve is not growing. To succeed in a market that is stable or contracting, we must gain market share from our competitors, which is more difficult than growing in an expanding market. As long as economic conditions in the United Statesand certain European markets remain difficult, this will be an additional challenge we must face and overcome.  Loss ofa significant licensed property could harm our business.  In addition to developing and marketing products based onproperties we own or control, we also seek to obtain licenses enabling us to develop and market products based on popular entertainment properties owned by third parties.  We currently have in-licenses to several successful entertainment properties, including MARVEL, STAR WARS, BEYBLADE and SESAME STREET. These licenses typically have multi-year terms and provide us withthe right to market and sell designated classes of products. In recent years our sales of products under the MARVEL, STAR WARS, BEYBLADE and SESAME STREET licenses have been highly significant to our business. If any of these licenses were toterminate and not be renewed, or the popularity of any of these licensed properties was to significantly decline, our business would be damaged and we would need to successfully develop and market other products to replace the products previouslyoffered under license.  Our license to the MARVEL property is granted from Marvel Entertainment, LLC and Marvel Characters B.V.(together Marvel). Our license to the STAR WARS property is granted by Lucas Licensing Ltd. and Lucasfilm Ltd. (together Lucas). Both Marvel and Lucas are owned by The Walt Disney Company. Delays or increased costs associated with the development and offering of entertainment media based upon or related to our brands,can harm our business and profitability.  Entertainment media, in forms such as television, motion pictures, DVDreleases and other media, can provide popular platforms for consumers to experience our owned and licensed brands and the success, or lack of success, of such media efforts can significantly impact the demand for our products and our financialsuccess. We spend considerable resources in designing and developing products in conjunction with planned media releases. Not only our efforts, but the efforts of third parties, heavily impact the timing of media development, release dates and theultimate consumer interest in and success of these media efforts.  The ultimate timing and success of such projects iscritically dependent on the efforts and schedules of our licensors, and studio and media partners. We do not fully control when or if any particular motion picture projects will be greenlit or released, and our licensors or media partners may changetheir plans with respect to projects and release dates. This can make it difficult for us to plan future entertainment slates and to successfully develop and market products in conjunction with future motion picture and other media releases, giventhe lengthy lead times involved in product development and successful marketing efforts.  When we say that products or brandswill be supported by certain media releases, those statements are based on our current plans and expectations. Unforeseen factors may increase the cost of these releases, delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation. Any delay orcancellation of planned product development work, introductions, or media support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business.   13 Table of ContentsLack of sufficient consumer interest in entertainment media for which we offerproducts can harm our business.  Motion pictures, television or other media for which we develop products may not be aspopular with consumers as we anticipated. While it is difficult to anticipate what products may be sought after by consumers, it can be even more difficult to properly predict the popularity of media efforts and properties given the broad array ofcompeting offerings. If our and our partners media efforts fail to garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance, our revenues and the financial return from such efforts will be harmed. THE HUB, our cable television joint venture with Discovery Communications, Inc. in the United States, competes with a number of otherchildrens television networks for viewers, advertising revenue and distribution fees. There is no guarantee that THE HUB will be successful. Similarly, Hasbro Studios programming distributed internationally competes with programming frommany other parties. Lack of consumer interest in and acceptance of programming developed by Hasbro Studios, or other programming appearing on THE HUB, and products related to that programming, could significantly harm our business. Similarly, ourbusiness could be harmed by greater than expected costs, or unexpected delays or difficulties, associated with our investment in THE HUB, such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or in building advertising revenues for THE HUB.During 2012 the Company paid $59,277 for programming developed by Hasbro Studios and anticipates that it will continue spending at comparable levels in 2013 and future years.  At December 30, 2012, $330,746, or 7.6%, of our total assets represented our investment in THE HUB. If THE HUB does not achieve success, or if there are subsequent declines in the success orprofitability of the channel, then our investment may become impaired, which could result in a write-down through net earnings. Part of our strategy to remain relevant to children and families is to offer innovative products incorporating greater technologyand which marry digital and analog play. The margins on many of these products are lower than more traditional toys and games and such products may have short lifespans. As children have grown older younger and have otherwise become interested in more and more sophisticated and adult products,such as video games, consumer electronics and social and digital media, at younger and younger ages, we have sought to keep our products relevant and interesting for these consumers. One initiative we have pursued to capture the interest of childrenis to offer innovative childrens electronic toy and game products. Increasing the marriage between digital and analog gaming and increasing the technology in our gaming products is another key for our future strategy. These electronic anddigital products, if successful, can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase our sales. However, childrens electronic and digital products, in addition to the risks associated with our other family entertainmentproducts, also face certain additional risks.  Our costs for designing, developing and producing electronic and digitalproducts, or products that marry digital and analog technology, tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products, such as board games and action figures. The ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient salesquantities and to reflect higher costs in higher prices is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment products, and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions. As a consequence, our margins on thesales of these products can be lower than for more traditional products and we can face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs. In addition, the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in theelectronics and digital gaming areas is potentially even greater than for our other products. This pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys andgames.   14 Table of ContentsOther economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we operate,including rising commodity and fuel prices, higher labor costs, increased transportation costs, outbreaks of public health pandemics or other diseases, or third party conduct could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products, andlower our revenues, margins and profitability.  Various economic and public health conditions can impact our ability tomanufacture and deliver products in a timely and cost-effective manner, or can otherwise have a significant negative impact on our revenues, profitability and business.  Significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers, such as gasoline, home heating fuels, or groceries, may reduce household spending on the discretionary branded playentertainment products we offer. As we discussed above, weakened economic conditions, lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products. Economic conditions may also benegatively impacted by terrorist attacks, wars and other conflicts, increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs, or the prospect of such events. Such a weakened economic and business climate, as well as consumer uncertainty created by sucha climate, could harm our revenues and profitability.  Our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for ourproducts, but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit. Rising fuel and raw material prices, for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components,increased transportation costs, and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products, which in turn may reduce our margins, reduce our profitabilityand harm our business.  Other conditions, such as the unavailability of sufficient quantities of electrical components, mayimpede our ability to manufacture, source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis. Additional factors outside of our control could further delay our products or increase the cost we pay to produce such products. For example, workstoppages, slowdowns or strikes, an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic, or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts, all could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product. Any of these factors could result in productdelays, increased costs and/or lost sales for our products.  Our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outsidethe United States subject us to risks associated with international operations.  We operate facilities and sellproducts in numerous countries outside the United States. For the year ended December 30, 2012, our net revenues from international customers comprised approximately 50% of our total consolidated net revenues. We expect our sales tointernational customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues. In fact, over time, we expect our international sales and operations to continue to grow both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall business asone of our key business strategies is to increase our presence in emerging and underserved international markets. Additionally, as we discuss below, we utilize third-party manufacturers located principally in the Far East to produce the majority ofour products, and we have a manufacturing facility in Ireland. These sales and manufacturing operations, including operations in emerging markets that we have entered, may enter, or may increase our presence in, are subject to the risks associatedwith international operations, including:      Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;      Limitations on the repatriation of earnings;      Potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross border transactions;     Political instability, civil unrest and economic instability;     Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;     Complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies;  15 Table of Contents   Difficulties understanding the retail climate, consumer trends, local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be quitedifferent from the United States;      Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and cost in recovering therefrom;     Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another, including port congestion, strikes and other transportation delays andinterruptions;      Changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing business internationally; and     The imposition of tariffs, quotas, or other protectionist measures. Because of the importance of our international sales and international sourcing of manufacturing to our business, our financial conditionand results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance. Our global operations mean we produce and buy products, and sell products, in many different jurisdictions with many different currencies.As a result, if the exchange rate between the United States dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes, our financial results as reported in U.S. dollars, may be meaningfullyimpacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected. As an example, if the dollar appreciates 10% relative to a local currency for an international market in which we had $200 million of net revenues, the dollarvalue of those sales, as they are translated into U.S. dollars, would decrease by $20 million in our consolidated financial results. As such, we would recognize a $20 million decrease in our net revenues, even if the actual level ofsales in the foreign market had not changed. Similarly, our expenses in foreign markets can be significantly impacted, in U.S. dollar terms, by exchange rates, meaning the profitability of our business in U.S. dollar terms can benegatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control.  We may not realize the full benefit of ourlicenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties. In addition to designing and developing products based on our own brands, we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests byproducing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by third parties and licensed to us. The success of entertainment properties for which we have a license, such as MARVEL, STAR WARS, BEYBLADE or SESAME STREET related products,can significantly affect our revenues and profitability. If we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series, the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products weare offering. In addition, competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure, maintain, and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms, if at all, and to attract and retainthe talented employees necessary to design, develop and market successful products based on these properties.  The licenseagreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial, and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales, which could result in write-offsof significant amounts which in turn would harm our results of operations. At December 30, 2012, we had $163,875 of prepaid royalties, $86,361 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $77,514 of which are includedin other assets. Under the terms of existing contracts as of December 30, 2012, we may be required to pay future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately $227,000. Acquiring or renewing licenses may requirethe payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable, which may result in losing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal, or missing business opportunities for new licenses.Additionally, as a licensee of entertainment-based properties we have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will translate into successful toy, game or other family entertainment products, and underperformance of any such products mayresult in reduced revenues and operating profit for us.   16 Table of ContentsWe anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases may make itincreasingly difficult for us to profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk. Furthermore, there can be noassurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future, as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market. In the event that we are notable to acquire or maintain successful entertainment licenses on advantageous terms, our revenues and profits may be harmed. Our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend, in large part, on our sales during the relativelybrief holiday shopping season. This seasonality is exacerbated by retailers quick response inventory management techniques.  Sales of our toys, games and other family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from September through December inanticipation of the holiday season, including Christmas. This seasonality has increased over time, as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques. Customers are timingtheir orders so that they are being filled by suppliers, such as us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. For toys, games and other family entertainment products which we produce, a majority of retail sales for the entire year generallyoccur in the fourth quarter, close to the holiday season. As a consequence, the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from September through December, as our customers do not want to maintain large on-hand inventories throughoutthe year ahead of consumer demand. While these techniques reduce a retailers investment in inventory, they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carryingcosts to the supplier.  The limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales resulting in lowerrevenues for us. If we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to fully meet consumer demand.Additionally, the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance.This seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital, mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holidayseason in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers. Our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand, resulting in our underproducingpopular items and/or overproducing less popular items, would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations. In addition, as a result of the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly and adversely affected, in a mannerdisproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year, by unforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or economic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key sellingseason, or by events such as strikes or port delays that interfere with the shipment of goods, particularly from the Far East, during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season. The concentration of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policiesor patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us.  We depend upon a relatively small retailcustomer base to sell the majority of our products. For the fiscal year ended December 30, 2012, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Toys R Us, Inc. and Target Corporation, accounted for approximately 17%, 11% and 10%, respectively, of ourconsolidated net revenues and our five largest customers, including Wal-Mart, Toys R Us and Target, in the aggregate accounted for approximately 42% of our consolidated net revenues. In the U.S. and Canada segment, approximately 64%of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers. If one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing business with us, significantly reduce the amountof   17 Table of Contentstheir purchases from us, favor competitors or new entrants, increase their direct competition with us by expanding their private-label business, change their purchasing patterns, alter the mannerin which they promote our products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products, or return substantial amounts of our products, it could significantly harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. Customers make nobinding long-term commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders. Any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products, and reduce the number and variety of our products that it carriesand the shelf space allotted for our products. In addition, increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than wouldotherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers. Furthermore, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and profitability. Our use of third-party manufacturers to produce the majority of our toy products, as well as certain other products, presents risksto our business.  We own and operate two manufacturing facilities, one in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts and the otherin Waterford, Ireland. However, most of our products are manufactured by third-party manufacturers, most of whom are located in the Peoples Republic of China (China). Although, our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted,over a significant period of time, to alternative sources of supply, should such changes be necessary. If we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political, civil, labor orother factors beyond our control, including natural disasters or pandemics, our operations may be substantially disrupted, potentially for a significant period of time. This delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harmour business while alternative sources of supply are secured.  Given that the majority of our toy manufacturing is conducted bythird-party manufacturers located in China, health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in China and affecting the movement of people and products into and from China to our major markets, including North America andEurope, as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in China, could have a significant negative impact on our operations, revenues and earnings. Factors that could negatively affect our business include a potentialsignificant revaluation of the Chinese Yuan, which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products in China, labor shortages and increases in labor costs in China as well as difficulties in moving products manufactured in China out ofAsia and through the ports in North America and Europe, whether due to port congestion, labor disputes, product regulations and/or inspections or other factors, and natural disasters or health pandemics impacting China. Also, the imposition of tradesanctions or other regulations by the United States or the European Union against products imported by us from, or the loss of normal trade relations status with, China, could significantly increase our cost of products imported into theUnited States or Europe and harm our business. Additionally, the suspension of the operations of a third-party manufacturer by government inspectors in China could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales. We require our third-party manufacturers to comply with our Global Business Ethics Principles, which are designed to prevent productsmanufactured by or for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions. Our Global Business Ethics Principles address a number of issues, including working hours and compensation, health and safety, and abuse and discrimination. Inaddition, we require that our products supplied by third-party manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including consumer and product safety laws in the markets where those products are sold. Hasbro has theright and exercises such right, both directly and through the use of outside monitors, to monitor compliance by our third-party manufacturers with our Global Business Ethics Principles and other manufacturing requirements. In addition, we do qualityassurance testing on our products, including products manufactured for us by third parties. Notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them, there is always a risk that one or more of our third-partymanufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such non-compliance. Any failure of our third-party manufacturers to comply with labor, consumer, product safety or other applicable requirements inmanufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation, harm sales of our products and potentially create liability for us.   18 Table of ContentsDifficulties associated with the implementation of our plan to reinvent our gamingbusiness may harm our revenues and profitability.  Recognizing the critical need for increased innovation and a changein the way we go to market with gaming products in order to remain successful in the gaming business in the future, we began implementing a strategy in 2011 to reinvent our gaming business. The objective of this plan was to stabilize our gamingbusiness in 2012, and to position it to grow in 2013 and beyond. Our strategy to drive our gaming business in the future involves substantial changes in how we market our gaming products to consumers and how we position them at retail, a focus ondelivering industry leading innovation in gaming, a change in our allocation of focus across gaming brands, greater penetration of our brands into digital gaming and the successful combination of analog and digital gaming. We also are designing ourgaming products to recognize the need to provide immersive game play in shorter periods of time, and to offer innovative face to face and off the board gaming opportunities. Our failure to successfully implement our strategy to reinvent our gamingbusiness and to otherwise stabilize and grow our gaming business in the future could substantially harm our business, resulting in lost revenues and lost profits. There can be no assurance that we will successfully implement our global gamingstrategy.  Our success is critically dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees. Our officers and employees are at the heart of all of our branded play efforts. It is their skill, innovation and hardwork that drive our success. We compete with many other potential employers in recruiting, hiring and retaining our senior management team and our many other skilled officers and other employees. There is no guarantee that we will be able torecruit, hire or retain the senior management, officers and other employees we need to succeed. Our loss of key management or other employees, or our inability to hire talented people we need in the future, could significantly harm our business. To remain competitive we must continuously work to increase efficiency and reduce costs, but there is no guarantee wewill be successful in this regard.  Our business is extremely competitive, the pace of change in our industry isgetting faster and our competitors are always working to be more efficient and profitable. To compete we must continuously improve our processes, increase efficiency and work to reduce our expenses. To improve our profitability and competitiveness,in the fourth quarter of 2012 we implemented a global cost savings initiative. The objective of this initiative is to reduce our operating costs by an annual amount of $100 million by 2015. We intend to achieve this by focusing on fewer, more globalbrand initiatives, workforce reductions, facility consolidation and other process improvements. However, this is no guarantee we will achieve our cost savings goals.  We rely on external financing, including our credit facility, to help fund our operations. If we were unable to obtain or service such financing, or if the restrictions imposed by such financingwere too burdensome, our business would be harmed.  Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet ourworking capital needs, particularly those in the third and fourth quarters, we rely on our revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital. We currently have a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2017, whichprovides for a $700,000 committed revolving credit facility. The credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility. Theserestrictive covenants may limit our future actions as well as our financial, operating and strategic flexibility. In addition, our financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility. Our performance and financial conditionmay not meet our original expectations, causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants. Non-compliance with our debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines, acircumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue to fund our operations.  We also have a commercial paper program which, subject to market conditions, allows us to issue up to $700,000 in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a further source ofworking   19 Table of Contentscapital funding and liquidity. There is no guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms, or at all, at any given point in time. At December 30, 2012 there was$209,200 outstanding under this program.  Not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to accesssources of external financing, but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing. In times of severe economic downturn and/or distress in the credit markets, it is possible that one or moresources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us. In such a situation, it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities, and it might not be possible to find alternativesources of funding.  We also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to time, through the issuance of debtsecurities. Our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interest rates, and the overall conditionof the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Variations in these factors couldmake it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities. The failure to receive financing on desirable terms, or at all, could damage our ability to support our futureoperations or capital needs or engage in other business activities.  As of December 30, 2012, we had $1,384,895 of totalprincipal amount of long-term debt outstanding. If we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default. There is no guarantee that we would be able torefinance debt on favorable terms, or at all.  As a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinationalcorporation, we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future, violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business. In addition, we could be the subject of futureproduct liability suits or product recalls, which could harm our business.  As a manufacturer of consumer products, weare subject to significant government regulations, including, in the United States, under The Consumer Products Safety Act, The Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and The Flammable Fabrics Act, as well as under product safety and consumer protectionstatutes in our international markets. In addition, certain of our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration or similar international authorities. In addition, advertising to children is subject to regulation by theFederal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and a host of other agencies globally, and the collection of information from children under the age of thirteen is subject to the provisions of the Childrens Online PrivacyProtection Act. While we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance and failure to comply with these acts could result in sanctions which could have a negativeimpact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall. While costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material toour business, the costs associated with future product recalls individually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year could be significant. In addition, any product recall, regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm consumer perceptionsof our products and have a negative impact on our future revenues and results of operations.  Governments and regulatoryagencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with product safety andconsumer protection regulations. In addition, one or more of our customers might require changes in our products, such as the non-use of certain materials, in the future. Complying with any such additional regulations or requirements could imposeincreased costs on our business. Similarly, increased penalties for non-compliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations. Such increased costs or penalties could harm ourbusiness.   20 Table of ContentsAs a large, multinational corporation, we are subject to a host of governmental regulationsthroughout the world, including antitrust, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, environmental regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce ourprofitability and our failure to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition. Our business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully. In addition,we have a material amount of acquired product rights which, if impaired, would result in a reduction of our net earnings.  Our intellectual property, including our license agreements and other agreements that establish our ownership rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, is of great value. Werely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands in the United States and around the world. From time to time, thirdparties have challenged, and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our intellectual property in the United States and around the world. In addition, our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products orinfringing on our intellectual property rights. We may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. Our failure to protect our intellectual propertyrights could harm our business and competitive position. Much of our intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our balance sheet. However, as of December 30, 2012, we had $416,659 of acquired product andlicensing rights included in other assets on our balance sheet. Declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed products may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairmentcharge. Reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results.  We may not realizethe anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures, or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization.  Acquisitions have been a component of our historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our product offerings. In making acquisitions, we target companies that we believe offerattractive family entertainment products or the ability for us to leverage our entertainment offerings. In the case of our joint venture with Discovery, we looked to partner with a company that has shown the ability to establish and operatecompelling entertainment channels. However, we cannot be certain that the products of companies we may acquire, or acquire an interest in, will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers in the future or that any such acquired companies orinvestments will allow us to more effectively market our products. In some cases, we expect that the integration of the companies that we may acquire into our operations will create production, marketing and other operating synergies which willproduce greater revenue growth and profitability and, where applicable, cost savings, operating efficiencies and other advantages. However, we cannot be certain that these synergies, efficiencies and cost savings will be realized. Even if achieved,these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization. In other cases, we may acquire companies that we believe have strong and creative management, in which case we may plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integratingthem into our operations. We cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies would continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they would develop popular and profitable products or services in the future. Failure to operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our salesor profitability.  We rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications to managemany aspects of our business, including management of our supply chain, sale and delivery of our products and various other process transactions. We are dependent on the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems and relatedback-up systems. These systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events such as hurricanes, fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes,acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees. The efficient   21 Table of Contentsoperation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems, including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate upgrades or newtechnologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully. The failure of our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business, require significantcapital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability.  If our electronic data is compromised ourbusiness could be significantly harmed.  We maintain significant amounts of data electronically in locations around theworld. This data relates to all aspects of our business and also contains certain customer and consumer data. We maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data, but notwithstanding such protective measures, there is a risk of intrusionor tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data. In addition, we provide confidential and proprietary information to our third party business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business.While we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data, and where applicable, that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties, nonetheless those partners mayalso be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of such data. Any compromise of the confidential data of our customers, our consumers, or ourselves could have a negative effect on our business. From time to time, we are involved in litigation, arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which couldentail significant expense.  As is the case with many large multinational corporations, we are subject, from time totime, to regulatory investigations, litigation and arbitration disputes, including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of products that have been or may be developed by us. Because the outcome oflitigation, arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant cost for us and harm our business. The fact that we operate in significantnumbers of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements. Any successful claim against us could significantlyharm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We have a material amount of goodwill which, if itbecomes impaired, would result in a reduction in our net earnings.  Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of anacquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire. Goodwill is not amortized and is required to be periodically evaluated for impairment. At December 30, 2012, $474,925, or 11.0%, of our total assets represented goodwill. Declinesin our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in a write-down of our goodwill and consequently harm our results of operations.  "

Unless otherwise specificallyindicated, all dollar or share amounts herein are expressed in thousands of dollars or shares, except for per share amounts. The volatility of changing consumer interests makes it difficult to design and develop products which will be popular with childrenand families.  The childrens and family entertainment business is one in which consumer interests evolveextremely quickly and can change dramatically from year to year. To be successful requires properly anticipating what content, properties and products will capture childrens and families interests and imagination, and then quicklydeveloping and marketing products to meet those interests. Critical to this process is understanding market insights that drive product popularity and providing innovative product offerings which can compete successfully against many other productsfor consumers limited time, attention and spending.  Our performance depends on our successful ability to develop, marketand sell innovative toys, games and other entertainment offerings, and license our brands for products which are sought after by consumers, including both children and their parents. We need to do this in an environment of rapidly evolving consumertastes and increasing utilization of technology and digital media in product offerings. Consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment are continuously changing and are difficult to anticipate. We may not successfully identify, design andmarket product offerings which are sought after by consumers. Evolving consumer tastes, coupled with an ever changing pipeline of entertainment and consumer properties and products which compete for  10 Table of Contentschildrens and families interest and acceptance, create an environment in which some products can fail to achieve consumer acceptance, and other products can be extremely popularduring a certain period in time but then rapidly be replaced in consumers minds with other properties. As a result, individual family entertainment products and properties often have short consumer life cycles. If we devote time and resources to developing entertainment and consumer products that consumers do not find interesting enough to buy insignificant quantities to be profitable to us, our sales and profits will decline and our business performance will be damaged. Similarly, brands or products that were successful at one time may lose consumer interest over time as tastes change andproduct innovation continues. Our success is critically dependent upon developing and maintaining the consumer appeal of our brands and products and in our ongoing ability to achieve and maintain market interest in and acceptance of our offerings toa degree that enables those brands and products to be profitable.  Additionally, our business is increasingly global anddepends on interest in and acceptance of our entertainment and consumer product offerings by consumers in diverse markets outside of the United States. As such, our success depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changingconsumer tastes and preferences in different markets and geographies and to design product offerings that can achieve popularity globally over a broad and diverse consumer audience. A decline in the popularity of our existing brands, products and product lines, or the failure of our new brands, products and productlines to achieve and sustain sufficient interest from retailers and consumers, could significantly lower our revenues and operating margins, which would in turn harm our profitability, business and financial condition. The challenge of continuouslydeveloping and offering products that are sought after by children is compounded by the sophistication of todays children and the incredible array of entertainment offerings available to them. Children are expanding their interests beyondtraditional toys and games to a wider array of innovative, technology driven entertainment products at younger and younger ages and, as a result, at younger and younger ages, our products compete with the offerings of video game suppliers, consumerelectronics companies, digital media and social media companies, and other businesses outside of the traditional toy and game industry.  There is no guarantee that:      Any of our brands, products or product lines will achieve popularity or continue to be popular;     Any property for which we have a significant license will achieve or sustain popularity;     Any new products or product lines we introduce will be considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate market acceptance; or     Any products life cycle or sales quantities will be sufficient to permit us to profitably recover our development, manufacturing, marketing,royalties (including royalty advances and guarantees) and other costs of producing, marketing and selling the product.  An inability to develop and introduce planned new brands, products and product lines in a timely and cost-effective manner may damage our business. In developing new brands, products and product lines, we have anticipated dates for the associated product introductions. When we statethat we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a particular product or product line at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development, implementation, and marketing work in accordance with ourcurrently anticipated development schedule. There is no guarantee that we will be able to manufacture, source and ship new or continuing products in a timely manner and on a cost-effective basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands. Thisrisk is heightened by our customers compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business. The risk is also exacerbated by the increasing sophistication of many of the products we are designing, in terms of combining digital andanalog technologies, utilizing digital media to a greater degree, and providing greater innovation and product differentiation. Unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process, significant increases in the planned cost of development,or changes in anticipated consumer demand for our products may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or, in some situations, may cause a product introduction to be discontinued.   11 Table of ContentsThe childrens and family entertainment industry is highly competitive and thereare low barriers to entry. If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors our sales, market share and profitability could decline.  The childrens and family entertainment industry is, and will continue to be, highly competitive. We compete domestically and internationally with a wide array of large and small manufacturers,marketers, and sellers of toys, games, video games, digital media and other entertainment and consumer products, as well as with retailers. We face competitors who are constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends,seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer purchasing.  In addition to existing competitors, the barriers to entry for new participants in the childrens and family entertainment industry are low, and the increasing importance of digital media, and theheightened connection between digital media and consumer interest, has further increased the ability for new participants to enter our markets. New participants with a popular product idea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers andbecome a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time. These existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences. In some cases our competitorsproducts may achieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products, lower our sales and lower our profitability.  Delays or increased costs associated with the development and offering of entertainment media based upon or related to our brands, or lack of sufficient consumer interest in such entertainmentmedia, can harm our business and profitability.  As part of our strategy of offering immersive branded playexperiences, we look to offer consumers the ability to enjoy our brands in as many different forms and formats as possible. Entertainment media, in forms such as motion pictures and television, can provide popular platforms for consumers toexperience our brands and the success, or lack of success, of such media efforts can significantly impact the demand for our products and our financial success.  The success of our products is often dependent on the timelines and effectiveness of media efforts by us and our partners. Television programming, motion picture and DVD releases, comic book releases, andother media efforts are often critical in generating interest in our products and brands and we spend considerable amounts of time and sums of money in designing and developing products in conjunction with planned media releases. Not only ourefforts, but the efforts of third parties, heavily impact the timing of media development, release dates and the ultimate consumer interest in and success of these media efforts. For example, development and release of motion pictures based on our brands involves working extremely closely with our studio partners inindentifying projects, developing them, and scheduling them for release. The ultimate timing and success of such projects is critically dependent on the efforts and schedules of our studio partners. We do not fully control when or if any particularmotion picture projects will be greenlit or released. This can make it difficult for us to plan our future movie slates and to successfully develop and market products in conjunction with future motion picture releases, given the lengthy lead timesinvolved in product development and successful marketing efforts.  When we say that products or brands will be supported bycertain media releases, those statements are based on our current plans and expectations. Unforeseen factors may increase the cost of these releases, delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation. Any delay or cancellation of plannedproduct development work, introductions, or media support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business. Even when motion pictures, television or other media is developed and released, consumers may not be as interested in that media, and inany associated products, as we had anticipated. While it is difficult to anticipate what products may be sought after by consumers, it can be even more difficult to properly predict the popularity of media efforts, given the broad array of competingofferings. If our and our partners media efforts fail to garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance, our revenues and the financial return from such efforts will be harmed.   12 Table of ContentsIn 2009 we entered into a joint venture with Discovery Communications, Inc. Through thatjoint venture, we launched a childrens and family entertainment channel called THE HUB in October of 2010. In connection with this joint venture effort, we also developed a wholly-owned studio, called Hasbro Studios, which is responsible fordeveloping and producing television entertainment media, based on our owned and licensed brands. The television programming developed by Hasbro Studios is offered in the United States on THE HUB and is distributed on other networks internationally. THE HUB is competing with a number of other childrens television networks in the United States for viewers, advertisingrevenue and distribution fees. There is no guarantee that THE HUB will be successful. Similarly, Hasbro Studios programming distributed internationally competes with programming from many other parties. Lack of consumer interest in andacceptance of programming developed by Hasbro Studios or other programming appearing on THE HUB, and products related to that programming, could significantly harm our business, particularly given that we are investing significant sums of moneydeveloping that programming. Similarly, our business could be harmed by greater than expected costs, or unexpected delays or difficulties, associated with our investment in THE HUB, such as difficulties in increasing subscribers to the network or inbuilding advertising revenues for THE HUB. During 2011 the Company incurred $80,983 for programming developed by Hasbro Studios and anticipates that it will continue spending at comparable levels in 2012 and future years. At December 25, 2011, $343,835, or 8.3%, of our total assets represented our investment in THE HUB. If THE HUB does not achievesuccess, or there are subsequent declines in the success or profitability of the channel, then our investment may become impaired, which could result in a write-down through net earnings. U.S., global and regional economic downturns that negatively impact the retail and credit markets, or that otherwise damage thefinancial health of our retail customers and consumers, can harm our business and financial performance.  We design,manufacture and market a wide variety of entertainment and consumer products worldwide through sales to our retail customers and directly to consumers. Our financial performance is impacted by the level of discretionary consumer spending. Recessionsand other economic downturns, or disruptions in credit markets, in the U.S. and in other markets in which our products are marketed and sold can result in lower levels of economic activity, lower employment levels, less consumer disposable income,and lower consumer confidence. Similarly, reductions in the value of key assets held by consumers, such as their homes or stock market investments, can lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power. Any of these factors can reduce the amountwhich consumers spend on the purchase of our products. This in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our financial performance and profitability.  In addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our products during times of economic difficulty, in an effort to maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price of ourproducts, increase our promotional spending and/or sales allowances, or take other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our products. Those steps may lower our net revenues or increase our costs, thereby decreasing our operatingmargins and lowering our profitability.  Given the difficult economic conditions in the United States over the past few years,we have been challenged in our efforts to grow our U.S. business and improve its profitability. As long as economic conditions in the U.S. remain difficult, this will be an additional challenge we must face and overcome if we are to succeed in ourefforts at growing this business. Similarly, while our European business has grown significantly in recent years, our future success in Europe is dependent upon economic conditions in Europe. A European sovereign debt crisis or other significantnegative shock to European markets could lead to a recession in Europe, which would negatively impact consumers and in turn, sales of our products in the European markets.   13 Table of ContentsOther economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we operate,including rising commodity and fuel prices, higher labor costs, increased transportation costs, outbreaks of public health pandemics or other diseases, or third party conduct could negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products, andlower our revenues, margins and profitability.  Various economic and public health conditions can impact our ability tomanufacture and deliver products in a timely and cost-effective manner, or can otherwise have a significant negative impact on our sales, profitability and our business.  Significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers, such as gasoline, home heating fuels, or groceries, may reduce household spending on the discretionary branded playentertainment products we offer. As we discussed above, weakened economic conditions, lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer purchases of our products. Economic conditions may also benegatively impacted by terrorist attacks, wars and other conflicts, increases in critical commodity prices or labor costs, or the prospect of such events. Such a weakened economic and business climate, as well as consumer uncertainty created by sucha climate, could harm our revenues and profitability.  Our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand for ourproducts, but also on our ability to produce and sell those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit. Rising fuel and raw material prices, for paperboard and other components such as resin used in plastics or electronic components,increased transportation costs, and increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our products, which in turn may reduce our margins, reduce our profitabilityand harm our business.  Other conditions, such as the unavailability of sufficient quantities of electrical components, mayimpede our ability to manufacture, source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis. Additional factors outside of our control could further delay our products or increase the cost we pay to produce such products. For example, workstoppages, slowdowns or strikes, an outbreak of a severe public health pandemic, or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts, all could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product. Any of these factors could result in productdelays, increased costs and/or lost sales for our products.  Our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outsidethe United States subject us to risks associated with international operations.  We operate facilities and sellproducts in numerous countries outside the United States. For the year ended December 25, 2011, our net revenues from international customers comprised approximately 50% of our total consolidated net revenues. We expect our sales tointernational customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues. In fact, over time, we expect our international sales and operations to continue to grow both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall business asone of our key business strategies is to increase our presence in emerging and underserved markets. Additionally, as we discuss below, we utilize third-party manufacturers located principally in the Far East, to produce the majority of our products,and we have a manufacturing facility in Ireland. These sales and manufacturing operations, including operations in emerging markets that we have entered, may enter, or may increase our presence in, are subject to the risks associated withinternational operations, including:      Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;      Limitations, including taxes, on the repatriation of earnings;     Potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and other aspects of our cross border transactions;     Political instability, civil unrest and economic instability;     Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;     Complications in complying with different laws in varying jurisdictions and in dealing with changes in governmental policies;  14 Table of Contents   Difficulties understanding the retail climate, consumer trends, local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets which may be quitedifferent from the United States;      Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and expense in recovering therefrom;     Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country to another, including port congestion, strikes and other transportation delays andinterruptions;      Changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing business internationally; and     The imposition of tariffs, quotas, or other protectionist measures. Because of the importance of our international sales and international sourcing of manufacturing to our business, our financial conditionand results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur or if we are otherwise unsuccessful in managing our increasing global business. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates can significantly impact our reported financial performance. Our global operations mean we produce and buy products, and sell products, in many different jurisdictions with many different foreigncurrencies. As a result, if the exchange rate between the United States dollar and a local currency for an international market in which we have significant sales or operations changes, our financial results, reported in U.S. dollars, may bemeaningfully impacted even if our business in the local currency is not significantly affected. As an example, if the dollar appreciates 10% relative to a local currency for an international market in which we had $200 million of net sales, thedollar value of those sales, as they are translated into U.S. dollars, would decrease by $20 million in our consolidated financial results. As such, we would recognize a $20 million decrease in our net revenues, even if the actuallevel of sales in the foreign market had not changed. Similarly, our expenses in foreign markets can be significantly impacted, in U.S. dollar terms, by exchange rates, meaning the profitability of our business in U.S. dollar terms can benegatively impacted by exchange rate movements which we do not control.  We may not realize the full benefit of ourlicenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties. In addition to designing and developing products based on our own brands, we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests byproducing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by third parties and licensed to us. The success of entertainment properties for which we have a license, such as BEYBLADE, MARVEL, SESAME STREET or STAR WARS related products,can significantly affect our revenues and profitability. If we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series, the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products weare offering. In addition, competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure, maintain, and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms, if at all, and to attract and retainthe talented employees necessary to design, develop and market successful products based on these properties. The loss of rights granted pursuant to any of our licensing agreements could harm our business and competitive position. The license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial, andin some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales, which could result in write-offs of significant amounts which in turn would harm our results of operations. At December 25, 2011, we had $134,730 ofprepaid royalties, $16,788 of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $117,942 of which are included in other assets. Under the terms of existing contracts as of December 25, 2011, we may be required to pay futureminimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately $235,000. Acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable, which may result inlosing licenses that we currently hold when they become available for renewal, or missing business opportunities for new licenses. Additionally, as a licensee of entertainment based properties we have no guaranty that a particular property or brandwill translate into successful toy, game or other family entertainment products, and underperformance of any such products may result in reduced revenues and operating profit for us.   15 Table of ContentsWe anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases may make itincreasingly difficult for us to profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize their inventory risk. Furthermore, there can be noassurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future, as new entertainment properties and competitive products are continually being introduced to the market. In the event that we are notable to acquire or maintain successful entertainment licenses on advantageous terms, our revenues and profits may be harmed. Our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend, in large part, on our sales during the relativelybrief holiday shopping season. This seasonality is exacerbated by retailers quick response inventory management techniques.  Sales of our toys, games and other family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from September through December inanticipation of the holiday season, including Christmas. This seasonality has increased over time, as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques. Customers are timingtheir orders so that they are being filled by suppliers, such as us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. For toys, games and other family entertainment products which we produce, a majority of retail sales for the entire year generallyoccur in the fourth quarter, close to the holiday season. As a consequence, the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from September through December, as our customers do not want to maintain large on-hand inventories throughoutthe year ahead of consumer demand. While these techniques reduce a retailers investment in inventory, they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carryingcosts to the supplier.  The limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales, resulting in lowerrevenues for us. If we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to fully capture consumer interest inthe product. Additionally, the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce our sales and harm our financialperformance. This seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital, mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products duringthe holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers. Our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand, resulting in ourunderproducing popular items and/or overproducing less popular items, would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations. In addition, as a result of the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly and adversely affected,in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year, by unforeseen events, such as a terrorist attack or economic shock, that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during ourkey selling season, or by events, such as strikes or port delays, that interfere with the shipment of goods, particularly from the Far East, during the critical months leading up to the holiday purchasing season. The concentration of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional policiesor patterns of our major customers could have a significant impact on us.  We depend upon a relatively small retailcustomer base to sell the majority of our products. For the fiscal year ended December 25, 2011, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Toys R Us, Inc. and Target Corporation, accounted for approximately 20%, 11% and 10%, respectively, of ourconsolidated net revenues and our five largest customers, including Wal-Mart, Toys R Us and Target, in the aggregate accounted for approximately 45% of our consolidated net revenues. In the U.S. and Canada segment, approximately 68%of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top three customers. If one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing business with us, significantly reduce the amountof their purchases from us, favor competitors or new entrants, increase their direct competition with us by expanding their private-label business, change their purchasing patterns, alter the manner in which they promote  16 Table of Contentsour products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling our products, or return substantial amounts of our products, it could significantly harm our sales, profitability and financialcondition. Customers make no binding long-term commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering purchase orders. Any customer could reduce its overall purchase of our products, and reduce the number and variety ofour products that it carries and the shelf space allotted for our products. In addition, increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lowergross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers. Furthermore, the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues andresult in higher bad debt expense.  Our use of third-party manufacturers to produce the majority of our toy products, aswell as certain other products, presents risks to our business.  We own and operate two game and puzzle manufacturingfacilities, one in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts and the other in Waterford, Ireland. However, most of our toy products, in addition to certain other products, are manufactured by third-party manufacturers, most of whom are located in thePeoples Republic of China. Although our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted, over a significant period of time, to alternative sources of supply, should such changes be necessary, if we were prevented or delayed in obtainingproducts or components for a material portion of our product line due to political, civil, labor or other factors beyond our control, including natural disasters or pandemics, our operations would be substantially disrupted, potentially for asignificant period of time, while alternative sources of supply were secured. This delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability, and harm our business.  Given that the majority of our toy manufacturing is conducted by third-party manufacturers located in China, health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in China andaffecting the movement of people and products into and from China to our major markets, including North America and Europe, as well as increases in the costs of labor and other costs of doing business in China, could have a significant negativeimpact on our operations, revenues and earnings. Factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential significant revaluation of the Chinese Yuan, which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products in China, laborshortages and increases in labor costs in China, and difficulties in moving products manufactured in China out of Asia and through the ports in North America and Europe, whether due to port congestion, labor disputes, product regulations and/orinspections or other factors, and natural disasters or health pandemics impacting China. Also, the imposition of trade sanctions or other regulations by the United States or the European Union against products imported by us from, or the loss ofnormal trade relations status with, China, could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the United States or Europe and harm our business. Additionally, the suspension of the operations of a third-party manufacturer bygovernment inspectors in China could result in delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales.  We require ourthird-party manufacturers to comply with our Global Business Ethics Principles, which are designed to prevent products manufactured by or for us from being produced under inhumane or exploitive conditions. Our Global Business Ethics Principlesaddress a number of issues, including working hours and compensation, health and safety, and abuse and discrimination. In addition, Hasbro requires that our products supplied by third-party manufacturers be produced in compliance with all applicablelaws and regulations, including consumer and product safety laws in the markets where those products are sold. Hasbro has the right and exercises such right, both directly and through the use of outside monitors, to monitor compliance by ourthird-party manufacturers with our Global Business Ethics Principles and other manufacturing requirements. In addition, we do quality assurance testing on our products, including products manufactured for us by third parties. Notwithstanding theserequirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with them, there is always a risk that one or more of our third-party manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such non-compliance. Anyfailure of our third-party manufacturers to comply with labor, consumer, product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in damage to our reputation, harm sales of our products and potentially createliability for us.   17 Table of ContentsGreater than expected costs or difficulties associated with the implementation of ourplan to reinvent our gaming business may harm our revenues and profitability.  Recognizing the critical need forincreased innovation and a change in the way we go to market with gaming products in order to remain successful in the gaming business in the future, in 2011 we began implementing a ten point strategy to reinvent our gaming business. The objectiveof this plan is to stabilize our gaming business in 2012, and to position it to grow in 2013 and beyond. As part of executing this strategy, in the second quarter of 2011 we announced our creation of a Gaming Center of Excellence in Rhode Island.Our strategy to drive our gaming business in the future involves substantial changes in how we market our gaming products to consumers and how we position them at retail, a focus on delivering industry leading innovation in gaming, a change in ourallocation of focus across gaming brands, greater penetration of our brands into digital gaming and the successful combination of analog and digital gaming. We also are designing our gaming products to recognize the need to provide immersivegame-play in shorter periods of time, and to offer innovative face to face and off the board gaming opportunities. Our failure to successfully implement our strategy to reinvent our gaming business and to otherwise stabilize and grow our gamingbusiness in the future could substantially harm our business, resulting in lost revenues and lost profits. There can be no assurance that we will successfully implement our global gaming strategy. Our success is critically dependent on the efforts and dedication of our officers and other employees. Our officers and employees are at the heart of all of our branded play efforts. It is their skill, innovation and hard work that drive oursuccess. We compete with many other potential employers in recruiting, hiring and retaining our senior management team and our many other skilled officers and other employees. There is no guarantee that we will be able to recruit, hire or retain thesenior management, officers and other employees we need to succeed. Our loss of key management or other employees, or our inability to hire talented people we need in the future, could significantly harm our business. Part of our strategy for remaining relevant to children is to offer innovative childrens toy and game electronic productsincorporating greater technology. The margins on many of these products are lower than more traditional toys and games and such products may have a shorter lifespan than more traditional toys and games. As a result, sales of childrens toy andgame electronic products may lower our overall operating margins and produce more volatility in our business.  Aschildren have grown older younger and have otherwise become interested in more and more sophisticated and adult products, such as videogames, consumer electronics and social and digital media, at younger and younger ages, we have soughtto keep our products relevant for these consumers. One initiative we have pursued to capture the interest of children is to offer innovative childrens electronic toy and game products. Examples of such products in the last few years includeour FURREAL FRIENDS line of products, including COOKIE-MY PLAYFUL PUP, BUTTERSCOTCH PONY and BISCUIT-MY LOVIN PUP. Increasing the marriage between digital and analog gaming and increasing the technology in our gaming products is another keyfor our future strategy. These electronic and digital products, if successful, can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase our sales. However, childrens electronics, in addition to the risks associated with our otherfamily entertainment products, also face certain additional risks.  Our costs for designing, developing and producingelectronic and digital products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products, such as board games and action figures. The ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient sales quantities and to reflect higher costsin higher prices is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and entertainment products, and can be further constrained by difficult economic conditions. As a consequence, our margins on the sales of electronic products tend to belower than for more traditional products and we can face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs. In addition, the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics area is potentially evengreater than for our other products. This pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and games.   18 Table of ContentsWe rely on external financing, including our credit facility, to help fund ouroperations. If we were unable to obtain or service such financing, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome, our business would be harmed.  Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our working capital needs, particularly those in the third and fourth quarters, we rely on our revolving credit facility and our other creditfacilities for working capital. We currently have a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2014, which provides for a $500,000 committed revolving credit facility. The credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forthleverage and coverage requirements, and certain other limitations typical of an investment grade facility. These restrictive covenants may limit our future actions, and financial, operating and strategic flexibility. In addition, our financialcovenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility. Our performance and financial condition may not meet our original expectations, causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants. Non-compliance with our debt covenants couldresult in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank lines, a circumstance which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue tofund our operations.  In early 2011 we established a commercial paper program which, subject to market conditions, will allowus to issue up to $500,000 in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding from time to time as a further source of working capital funding and liquidity. There is no guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on favorable terms,or at all, at any given point in time.  Not only may our individual financial performance impact our ability to access sourcesof external financing, but significant disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our ability to obtain financing. In times of severe economic downturn and/or distress in the credit markets, it is possible that one or more sources ofexternal financing may be unable or unwilling to provide funding to us. In such a situation, it may be that we would be unable to access funding under our existing credit facilities, and it might not be possible to find alternative sources offunding.  We also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to time, through the issuance of debt securities. Ourability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interest rates, and the overall condition of thefinancial and credit markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Variations in these factors could makeit difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities. The failure to receive financing on desirable terms, or at all, could damage our ability to support our future operationsor capital needs or engage in other business activities.  As of December 25, 2011, we had $1,384,895 of total principalamount of indebtedness outstanding. If we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default. There is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt onfavorable terms, or at all.  As a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation, we aresubject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in the future, violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business. In addition, we could be the subject of future product liabilitysuits or product recalls, which could harm our business.  As a manufacturer of consumer products, we are subject tosignificant government regulations, including, in the United States, under The Consumer Products Safety Act, The Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and The Flammable Fabrics Act, as well as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in ourinternational markets. In addition, certain of our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration or similar international authorities. In addition, advertising to children is subject to regulation by the Federal TradeCommission, the Federal Communications Commission and a host of other agencies globally. While we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with these acts, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance, and failure to complywith these acts could result in sanctions which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be subject to involuntary product   19 Table of Contentsrecalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall. While costs associated with product recalls have generally not been material to our business, the costs associated with future product recallsindividually or in the aggregate in any given fiscal year, could be significant. In addition, any product recall, regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our futurerevenues and results of operations.  Governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell productsmay enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future, and may also increase the penalties for failure to comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations. In addition, one or more of ourcustomers might require changes in our products, such as the non-use of certain materials, in the future. Complying with any such additional regulations or requirements could impose increased costs on our business. Similarly, increased penalties fornon-compliance could subject us to greater expense in the event any of our products were found to not comply with such regulations. Such increased costs or penalties could harm our business. As a large, multinational corporation, we are subject to a host of governmental regulations throughout the world, including antitrust,customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, environmental regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Complying with these regulations imposes costs on us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to successfully complywith any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that could further harm our business and financial condition.  Our business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully. In addition, we have a material amount of acquired product rights which, ifimpaired, would result in a reduction of our net earnings.  Our intellectual property, including our license agreementsand other agreements that establish our ownership rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, is of great value. We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, patent and other proprietary rights laws toprotect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands in the U.S. and around the world. From time to time, third parties have challenged, and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our intellectual property in theU.S. and around the world. In addition, our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights. We may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual propertyrights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and competitive position. Much of our intellectual property has been internally developed andhas no carrying value on our balance sheet. However, as of December 25, 2011, we had $467,293 of acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets on our balance sheet. Declines in the profitability of the acquired brands orlicensed products may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and could result in an impairment charge. Reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or investments in joint ventures, or those benefits may be delayed orreduced in their realization.  Acquisitions have been a significant part of our historical growth and have enabled usto further broaden and diversify our product offerings. In making acquisitions, we target companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products or the ability for us to leverage our entertainment offerings. In the case of ourjoint venture with Discovery, we looked to partner with a company that has shown the ability to establish and operate compelling entertainment channels. However, we cannot be certain that the products of companies we may acquire, or acquire aninterest in, in the future will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers or that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to more effectively market our products. In some cases, we expect that the integration of the companiesthat we acquire into our operations will create production, marketing and other operating synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and, where applicable, cost savings, operating efficiencies and other advantages.However, we cannot be certain that these synergies, efficiencies and cost savings will be realized. Even if achieved, these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their   20 Table of Contentsrealization. In other cases, we acquire companies that we believe have strong and creative management, in which case we plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully integrating theminto our operations. We cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies will continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they will develop popular and profitable products or services in the future. Failure to operate our information systems and implement new technology effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our salesor profitability.  We rely extensively on various information technology systems and software applications, to managemany aspects of our business, including management of our supply chain, sale and delivery of our products and various other process transactions. We are dependent on the integrity, security and consistent operations of these systems and relatedback-up systems. These systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events such as hurricanes, fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes,acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees. The efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends on these information systems, including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriateupgrades or new technologies and systems and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully. The failure of our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business, requiresignificant capital investments to remediate a problem or subject us to liability.  If our electronic data iscompromised our business could be significantly harmed.  We maintain significant amounts of data electronically inlocations around the world. This data relates to all aspects of our business and also contains certain customer and consumer data. We maintain systems and processes designed to protect this data, but notwithstanding such protective measures, thereis a risk of intrusion or tampering that could compromise the integrity and privacy of this data. In addition, we provide confidential and proprietary information to our third party business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary toconduct our business. While we obtain assurances from those parties that they have systems and processes in place to protect such data, and where applicable, that they will take steps to assure the protections of such data by third parties,nonetheless those partners may also be subject to data intrusion or otherwise compromise the protection of such data. Any compromise of the confidential data of our customers, our consumers, or ourselves could have a negative effect on our business. From time to time, we are involved in litigation, arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain andwhich could entail significant expense.  As is the case with many large multinational corporations, we are subject,from time to time, to regulatory investigations, litigation and arbitration disputes, including potential liability from personal injury or property damage claims by the users of products that have been or may be developed by us. Because the outcomeof litigation, arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant expense for us and harm our business. The fact that we operate insignificant numbers of international markets also increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements. Any successful claim could significantlyharm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We have a material amount of goodwill which, if itbecomes impaired, would result in a reduction in our net earnings.  Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of anacquisition exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire. Goodwill is not amortized and is required to be periodically evaluated for impairment. At December 25, 2011, $474,792, or 11.5%, of our total assets represented goodwill. Declinesin our profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in a write-down of our goodwill. Reductions in our net earnings caused by the write-down of goodwill could harm our results of operations.   21 Table of Contents"

 That May Affect Future    Results     From time to time, including in this Annual Report on    Form 10-K    and in our annual report to shareholders, we publish    forward-looking statements within the meaning of the    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These    forward-looking statements may relate to such    matters as our anticipated financial performance or business    prospects in future periods, expected technological and product    developments, the expected content of and timing for new product    introductions or our expectations concerning the future    acceptance of products by customers, the content and timing of    entertainment releases, marketing and promotional efforts,    research and development activities, liquidity, and similar    matters. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to    risks and uncertainties. The Private Securities Litigation    Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking    statements. These statements may be identified by the use of    forward-looking words or phrases such as anticipate,    believe, could, expect,    intend, looking forward,    may, planned, potential,    should, will and would or    any variations of words with similar meanings. We note that a    variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience    to differ materially from the anticipated results or other    expectations expressed or anticipated in our forward-looking    statements. The factors listed below are illustrative and other    risks and uncertainties may arise as are or may be detailed from    time to time in our public announcements and our filings with    the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as on    Forms 8-K,10-Q and    10-K. We    undertake no obligation to make any revisions to the    forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on    Form 10-K    or in our annual report to shareholders to reflect events or    circumstances occurring after the date of the filing of this    report. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all dollar or    share amounts herein are expressed in thousands of dollars or    shares, except for per share amounts.    8Table of ContentsThe    volatility of ever-evolving consumer preferences, combined with    the high level of competition and low barriers to entry in the    family entertainment industry, make it difficult to achieve,    maintain or build upon the success of our brands, products and    product lines, or introduce successful new brands and products.    In addition, an inability to develop and introduce planned new    brands, products and product lines in a timely and    cost-effective manner may damage our business.     The childrens and family entertainment business is a    trend-driven industry where consumer demands and interests    evolve quickly. We may develop products which consumers do not    find interesting enough to buy in significant quantities to be    profitable to us. Similarly, brands or products that were    successful at one time may lose consumer interest. Our ongoing    success is critically dependent upon developing and maintaining    the consumer appeal of our brands and products and in our    ongoing ability to achieve and maintain market interest in and    acceptance of our offerings to a degree that enables those    brands and products to be profitable. Our failure to    successfully anticipate, identify and react to childrens    interests and the current preferences in family entertainment    could significantly lower sales of our products and harm our    business and profitability.     A decline in the popularity of our existing brands, products and    product lines, or the failure of our new brands, products and    product lines to achieve and sustain sufficient interest from    retailers and consumers, could significantly lower our revenues    and operating margins, which would in turn harm our    profitability, business and financial condition. In our    industry, it is critical to identify and offer what are    considered to be the next hot toys, games and other    entertainment offerings on childrens wish    lists and to effectively anticipate childrens    evolving entertainment interests. Our continued success will    depend on our ability to develop, market and sell popular toys,    games and other entertainment offerings, and license our brands    for products which are sought after by both children and their    parents, in spite of rapidly evolving consumer tastes. We seek    to achieve and maintain market popularity for our brands and    products through the continued re-imagination, re-invention,    re-ignition and extension of our existing family entertainment    properties in ways we believe will capture evolving consumer    interest and imagination, offer immersive brand experiences and    remain relevant in todays world, and by developing,    introducing and gaining customer interest for new family    entertainment products. This process involves anticipating and    extending successful play patterns, offering continual product    innovation and identifying and developing entertainment concepts    and properties that appeal to childrens imaginations and    feed the human need for play. However, consumer preferences with    respect to family entertainment are continuously changing and    are difficult to anticipate and we may not successfully identify    product offerings which are sought after by consumers. Evolving    consumer tastes, coupled with an ever changing pipeline of    entertainment properties and products which compete for consumer    interest and acceptance, create an environment in which some    products can fail to achieve consumer acceptance, and other    products can be extremely popular during a certain period in    time but then rapidly be replaced in consumers minds with    other properties. As a result, individual family entertainment    products and properties often have short consumer life cycles.     Not only must we address rapidly changing consumer tastes and    interests but we face competitors who are also constantly    monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes, seeking    ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new    products that compete with our products for consumer purchasing.    In addition to existing competitors, the barriers to entry for    new participants in the family entertainment industry are low.    New participants with a popular product idea or entertainment    property can gain access to consumers and become a significant    source of competition for our products in a very short period of    time. In some cases our competitors products may achieve    greater market acceptance than our products and potentially    reduce demand for our products and lower our profitability.     The challenge of continuously developing and offering products    that are sought after by children is compounded by the trend of    children getting older younger. By this we mean that    children are expanding their interests beyond traditional toys    and games to a wider array of entertainment products at younger    ages and, as a result, at younger and younger ages, our products    compete with the offerings of video game suppliers, consumer    electronics companies, media and social media companies and    other businesses outside of the traditional toy and game    industry.    9Table of Contents    There is no guarantee that:           Any of our brands, products or product lines will achieve    popularity or continue to be popular;           Any property for which we have a significant license will    achieve or sustain popularity;           Any new products or product lines we introduce will be    considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate    market acceptance;           Any products life cycle or sales quantities will be    sufficient to permit us to profitably recover our development,    manufacturing, marketing, royalties (including royalty advances    and guarantees) and other costs of producing, marketing and    selling the product; or           We will be able to manufacture, source and ship new or    continuing products in a timely and cost-effective basis to meet    constantly changing consumer demands, a risk that is heightened    by our customers compressed shipping schedules and the    seasonality of our business.     In developing new brands, products and product lines, we have    anticipated dates for the associated product introductions. When    we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a    particular product or product line at a certain time in the    future those expectations are based on completing the associated    development, implementation, and marketing work in accordance    with our currently anticipated development schedule. Unforeseen    delays or difficulties in the development process, significant    increases in the planned cost of development, or changes in    anticipated consumer demand for products may cause the    introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or,    in some situations, may cause a product introduction to be    discontinued. Delays    or increased costs associated with the development and offering    of entertainment media based upon or related to our brands, or    lack of sufficient consumer interest in such entertainment    media, can harm our business and profitability.     As part of our strategy of offering immersive brand experiences,    we look to offer consumers the ability to enjoy our brands in as    many different forms and formats as possible. Entertainment    media, in forms such as motion pictures and television, can    provide popular platforms for consumers to experience our brands    and the success, or lack of success, of such media efforts can    significantly impact demand for our products and our financial    success.     The success of our products is often dependent on the timelines    and effectiveness of media efforts. Television programming,    movie and DVD releases, comic book releases, and other media    efforts are often critical in generating interest in our    products and brands. Not only our efforts, but the efforts of    third parties, heavily impact the launch dates and success of    these media efforts. When we say that products or brands will be    supported by certain media releases, those statements are based    on our current plans and expectations. Unforeseen factors may    increase the cost of these releases, delay these media releases    or even lead to their cancellation. Any delay or cancellation of    planned product development work, introductions, or media    support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our    business.     Similarly, if our and our partners media efforts fail to    garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance, our revenues    and the financial return from such efforts will be harmed. In    2009 we entered into a joint venture with Discovery    Communications, Inc. (Discovery). Through that joint    venture, we launched a childrens and family entertainment    channel called THE HUB in October of 2010. In connection with    this joint venture effort, we also developed a wholly-owned    studio, called Hasbro Studios, which is responsible for    developing and producing television entertainment media,    primarily based on our brands. The television programming    developed by Hasbro Studios is offered in the United States on    THE HUB and will be distributed on other networks    internationally. THE HUB is competing with a number of other    childrens television networks in the United States for    viewers, advertising revenue and distribution fees. There is no    guarantee that THE HUB will be successful. Similarly, Hasbro    Studios programming distributed internationally competes    with programming by other parties. Lack of consumer interest in    and acceptance of THE HUB, programming appearing on THE HUB,    other programming developed by Hasbro Studios, and products    related to that programming could    10Table of Contents    significantly harm our business. Similarly, our business could    be harmed by greater than expected costs, or unexpected delays    or difficulties, associated with the development of Hasbro    Studios programming. During 2010 the Company incurred $52,047    for programming developed by Hasbro Studios and anticipates that    it will continue spending at increased levels in 2011 and future    years.     At December 26, 2010, $354,612, or 8.7%, of our total    assets represented our investment in THE HUB. If THE HUB does    not achieve success, or there are subsequent declines in the    success or profitability of the channel, then our investment may    become impaired, which could result in a write-down through net    earnings. Economic    downturns which negatively impact the retail and credit markets,    or which otherwise damage the financial health of our retail    customers and consumers, can harm our business and financial    performance.     The success of our family entertainment products and our    financial performance is dependent on consumer purchases of our    products. Consumers may not purchase our products because the    products do not capture consumer interest and imagination, or    because competitor family entertainment offerings are deemed    more attractive. But consumer spending on our products can also    be harmed by factors that negatively impact consumers    budgets generally, and which are not due to our product    offerings.     Recessions and other economic downturns, or disruptions in    credit markets, in the markets in which we operate can result in    lower levels of economic activity, lower employment levels, less    consumer disposable income, and lower consumer confidence.    Similarly, reductions in the value of key assets held by    consumers, such as their homes or stock market investments, can    lower consumer confidence and consumer spending power. Any of    these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on the    purchase of our products. This in turn can reduce our revenues    and harm our financial performance and profitability.     In addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our    products during times of economic difficulty, in an effort to    maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price    of our products, increase our promotional spending, or take    other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our    products. Those steps may lower our net revenues, decrease our    operating margins, increase our costs    and/or lower    our profitability. Other    economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we    operate, including rising commodity and fuel prices, higher    labor costs, increased transportation costs, outbreaks of public    health pandemics or other diseases, or third party conduct could    negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products,    and lower our revenues, margins and profitability.     Various economic and public health conditions can impact our    ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and    cost-effective manner, or can otherwise have a significant    negative impact on our business.     Significant increases in the costs of other products which are    required by consumers, such as gasoline, home heating fuels, or    groceries, may reduce household spending on the discretionary    entertainment products we offer. As we discussed above, weakened    economic conditions, lowered employment levels or recessions in    any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer    purchases of our products. Economic conditions may also be    negatively impacted by terrorist attacks, wars and other    conflicts, increases in critical commodity prices, or the    prospect of such events. Such a weakened economic and business    climate, as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a    climate, could harm our revenues and profitability.     Our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand    for our products, but also on our ability to produce and sell    those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit.    Rising fuel and raw material prices, for paperboard and other    components such as resin used in plastics or electronic    components, increased transportation costs, and increased labor    costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all    may increase the costs we incur to produce and transport our    products, which in turn may reduce our margins, reduce our    profitability and harm our business.     Other conditions, such as the unavailability of sufficient    quantities of electrical components, may impede our ability to    manufacture, source and ship new and continuing products on a    timely basis. Additional factors    11Table of Contents    outside of our control could further delay our products or    increase the cost we pay to produce such products. For example,    work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, an outbreak of a severe    public health pandemic, or the occurrence or threat of wars or    other conflicts, all could impact our ability to manufacture or    deliver product. Any of these factors could result in product    delays, increased costs    and/or lost    sales for our products. We may    not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed    material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from    the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum    guaranteed royalties.     In addition to designing and developing products based on our    own brands, we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and    interests by producing products based on popular entertainment    properties developed by other parties and licensed to us. The    success of entertainment properties for which we have a license,    such as MARVEL or STAR WARS related products, can significantly    affect our revenues and profitability. If we produce a line of    products based on a movie or television series, the success of    the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of    consumer interest in the associated products we are offering. In    addition, competition in our industry for access to    entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure,    maintain, and renew popular licenses to entertainment products    on beneficial terms, if at all, and to attract and retain the    talented employees necessary to design, develop and market    successful products based on these properties. The loss of    rights granted pursuant to any of our licensing agreements could    harm our business and competitive position.     The license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually    require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be    substantial, and in some cases may be greater than what we are    ultimately able to recoup from actual sales, which could result    in write-offs of significant amounts which in turn would harm    our results of operations. At December 26, 2010, we had    $112,922 of prepaid royalties, $17,922 of which are included in    prepaid expenses and other current assets and $95,000 of which    are included in other assets. Under the terms of existing    contracts as of December 26, 2010, we may be required to    pay future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees    totaling approximately $287,000. Acquiring or renewing licenses    may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we    consider to be too high to be profitable, which may result in    losing licenses we currently hold when they become available for    renewal, or missing business opportunities for new licenses.    Additionally, as a licensee of entertainment based properties we    have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will    translate into successful toy or game products.     We anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie    releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably    sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may    lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in    order to minimize their inventory risk. Furthermore, there can    be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be    successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future, as    new entertainment properties and competitive products are    continually being introduced to the market. In the event that we    are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainment    licenses on advantageous terms, our revenues and profits may be    harmed. Our    business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results    will depend, in large part, on our sales during the relatively    brief holiday shopping season. This seasonality is exacerbated    by retailers quick response inventory management    techniques.     Sales of our family entertainment products at retail are    extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring    during the period from September through December in    anticipation of the holiday season, including Christmas. This    seasonality has increased over time, as retailers become more    efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick    response inventory management techniques. Customers are timing    their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers, such as    us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. For toys, games    and other family entertainment products which we produce, a    majority of retail sales for the entire year generally occur in    the fourth quarter, close to the holiday season. As a    consequence, the majority of our sales to our customers occur in    the period from September through December, as our customers do    not want to maintain large on-hand inventories throughout the    year ahead of consumer demand. While these techniques    12Table of Contents    reduce a retailers investment in inventory, they increase    pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and    thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and    carrying costs to the supplier.     The limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or    delay retail sales, resulting in lower revenues for us. If we or    our customers determine that one of our products is more popular    at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have    sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to    fully capture consumer interest in the product. Additionally,    the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter    time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve    tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce    our sales and harm our financial performance. This seasonal    pattern requires significant use of working capital, mainly to    manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year    prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting    of demand for products during the holiday season in order to    avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing    excess inventory of products that are less popular with    consumers. Our failure to accurately predict and respond to    consumer demand, resulting in our underproducing popular items    and/or    overproducing less popular items, would reduce our total sales    and harm our results of operations. In addition, as a result of    the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly    and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the    impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the    year, by unforeseen events, such as a terrorist attack or    economic shock, that harm the retail environment or consumer    buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events,    such as strikes or port delays, that interfere with the shipment    of goods, particularly from the Far East, during the critical    months leading up to the holiday purchasing season. Our    substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the    United States subject us to risks associated with international    operations. Among these risks is the fact that fluctuations in    foreign exchange rates can significantly impact our financial    performance.     We operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries    outside the United States. For the year ended December 26,    2010, our net revenues from international customers comprised    approximately 46% of our total consolidated net revenues. We    expect our sales to international customers to continue to    account for a significant portion of our revenues. In fact, over    time, we expect our international sales and operations to grow    both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall    business as one of our key business strategies is to increase    our presence in emerging and underserved markets. Additionally,    as we discuss below, we utilize third-party manufacturers    located principally in the Far East, to produce the majority of    our products, and we have a manufacturing facility in Ireland.    These sales and manufacturing operations, including operations    in emerging markets that we have entered, may enter, or may    increase our presence in, are subject to the risks associated    with international operations, including:           Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;           Limitations, including taxes, on the repatriation of earnings;           Potential challenges to our transfer pricing determinations and    other aspects of our cross border transactions;           Political instability, civil unrest and economic instability;           Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and    weaker laws protecting such rights;           Complications in complying with different laws in varying    jurisdictions and changes in governmental policies;           Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and expense in    recovering therefrom;           Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country    to another, including port congestion, strikes and other    transportation delays and interruptions;           Changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing    business internationally; and           The imposition of tariffs, quotas, or other protectionist    measures.    13Table of Contents     Because of the importance of our international sales and    international sourcing of manufacturing to our business, our    financial condition and results of operations could be    significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to    occur.     If the exchange rate between the United States dollar and a    local currency for an international market in which we have    significant sales or operations changes, our financial results,    reported in U.S. dollars, may be meaningfully impacted even    if our business in the local currency is not significantly    affected. As an example, if the dollar appreciates 10% relative    to a local currency for an international market in which we had    $200 million of net sales, the dollar value of those sales,    as they are translated into U.S. dollars, would decrease by    $20 million in our consolidated financial results. As such,    we would recognize a $20 million decrease in our net    revenues, even if the actual level of sales in the foreign    market had not changed. Similarly, our expenses in foreign    markets can be significantly impacted, in U.S. dollar    terms, by exchange rates, meaning the profitability of our    business in U.S. dollar terms can be significantly harmed    by exchange rate movements. The    concentration of our retail customer base means that economic    difficulties or changes in the purchasing or promotional    policies of our major customers could have a significant impact    on us.     We depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell    the majority of our products. For the fiscal year ended    December 26, 2010, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Target    Corporation, and Toys R Us, Inc., accounted for    approximately 23%, 12% and 11%, respectively, of our    consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers,    including Wal-Mart, Target and Toys R Us, in the    aggregate accounted for approximately 50% of our consolidated    net revenues. In the U.S. and Canada segment, approximately    71% of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top    three customers. While the consolidation of our customer base    may provide certain benefits to us, such as potentially more    efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of    sales and distribution, this consolidation also means that if    one or more of our major customers were to experience    difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing    business with us, significantly reduce the amount of their    purchases from us, alter the manner in which they promote our    products or the resources they devote to promoting and selling    our products, or return substantial amounts of our products, it    could significantly harm our sales, profitability and financial    condition. Increased concentration among our customers could    also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales    prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins    than would otherwise be obtained if there were less    consolidation among our customers. In addition, the bankruptcy    or other lack of success of one or more of our significant    retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and result    in higher bad debt expense. Our    use of third-party manufacturers to produce the majority of our    toy products, as well as certain other products, presents risks    to our business.     We own and operate two game and puzzle manufacturing facilities,    one in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts and the other in    Waterford, Ireland. However, most of our toy products, in    addition to certain other products, are manufactured by    third-party manufacturers, most of whom are located in China.    Although our external sources of manufacturing can be shifted,    over a period of time, to alternative sources of supply, should    such changes be necessary, if we were prevented or delayed in    obtaining products or components for a material portion of our    product line due to political, labor or other factors beyond our    control, including natural disasters or pandemics, our    operations would be disrupted, potentially for a significant    period of time, while alternative sources of supply were    secured. This delay could significantly reduce our revenues and    profitability, and harm our business.     Given that the majority of our manufacturing is conducted by    third-party manufacturers located in China, health conditions    and other factors affecting social and economic activity in    China and affecting the movement of people and products into and    from China to our major markets, including North America and    Europe, as well as increases in the costs of labor and other    costs of doing business in China, could have a significant    negative impact on our operations, revenues and earnings.    Factors that could negatively affect our business include a    potential significant revaluation of the Chinese Yuan, which may    result in an increase in the cost of producing products in    China, labor shortage and increases in labor costs in China, and    difficulties in moving    14Table of Contents    products manufactured in China out of Asia and through the ports    on the western coast of North America, whether due to port    congestion, labor disputes, product regulations    and/or    inspections or other factors, and natural disasters or health    pandemics impacting China. Also, the imposition of trade    sanctions or other regulations by the United States or the    European Union against products imported by us from, or the loss    of normal trade relations status with, China, could    significantly increase our cost of products imported into the    United States or Europe and harm our business. Additionally, the    suspension of the operations of a third party manufacturer by    government inspectors in China could result in delays to us in    obtaining product and may harm sales.     We require our third-party manufacturers to comply with our    Global Business Ethics Principles, which are designed to prevent    products manufactured by or for us from being produced under    inhumane or exploitive conditions. The Global Business Ethics    Principles address a number of issues, including working hours    and compensation, health and safety, and abuse and    discrimination. In addition, Hasbro requires that our products    supplied by third-party manufacturers be produced in compliance    with all applicable laws and regulations, including consumer and    product safety laws in the markets where those products are    sold. Hasbro has the right and exercises such right, both    directly and through the use of outside monitors, to monitor    compliance by our third-party manufacturers with our Global    Business Ethics Principles and other manufacturing requirements.    In addition, we do quality assurance testing on our products,    including products manufactured for us by third parties.    Notwithstanding these requirements and our monitoring and    testing of compliance with them, there is always a risk that one    or more of our third-party manufacturers will not comply with    our requirements and that we will not immediately discover such    non-compliance. Any failure of our third-party manufacturers to    comply with labor, consumer, product safety or other applicable    requirements in manufacturing products for us could result in    damage to our reputation, harm sales of our products and    potentially create liability for us. Our    success is critically dependent on the efforts and dedication of    our employees.     Our employees are at the heart of all of our efforts. It is    their skill, innovation and hard work which drive our success.    We compete with many other potential employers in hiring and    retaining our employees. Although we continuously seek to    develop our employees, challenge them and compensate them    fairly, there is no guarantee that we will be able to hire or    retain the employees we need to succeed. Our loss of key    employees, or our inability to hire talented employees we need,    could significantly harm our business. Part    of our strategy for remaining relevant to children is to offer    innovative childrens toy and game electronic products. The    margins on many of these products are lower than more    traditional toys and games and such products may have a shorter    lifespan than more traditional toys and games. As a result,    sales of childrens toy and game electronic products may    lower our overall operating margins and produce more volatility    in our business.     As children have grown older younger and have    otherwise become interested in more and more sophisticated and    adult products, such as videogames, consumer electronics and    social media, at younger and younger ages, we have sought to    keep our products relevant for these consumers. One initiative    we have pursued to capture the interest of children is to offer    innovative childrens electronic toys and games. Examples    of such products in the last few years include our I-branded    products such as I-DOG and I-CAT, and our FURREAL FRIENDS line    of products, including BUTTERSCOTCH PONY and BISCUIT MY    LOVIN PUP. In 2011 we are offering games based on our    innovative LIVE platform and our most realistic member of the    FURREAL FRIENDS line to date, COOKIE, MY PLAYFUL PUP. These    products, if successful, can be an effective way for us to    connect with consumers and increase sales. However,    childrens electronics, in addition to the risks associated    with our other family entertainment products, also face certain    additional risks.     Our costs for designing, developing and producing electronic    products tend to be higher than for many of our other more    traditional products, such as board games and action figures.    The ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient    sales quantities and to reflect higher costs in higher prices is    constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and    entertainment products, and can be further constrained by    difficult economic conditions. As a consequence, our margins on    the sales of electronic products tend to be lower than for more    traditional products and we can face increased risk of not    achieving sales sufficient to recover our    15Table of Contents    costs. In addition, the pace of change in product offerings and    consumer tastes in the electronics area is potentially even    greater than for our other products. This pace of change means    that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain    consumer interest may be even shorter than traditional toys and    games. We    rely on external financing, including our credit facility, to    help fund our operations. If we were unable to obtain or service    such financing, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing    were too burdensome, our business would be harmed.     Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our    working capital needs, particularly those in the third and    fourth quarters, we rely on our revolving credit facility and    our other credit facilities for working capital. We currently    have a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2014, which    provides for a $500,000 committed revolving credit facility. The    credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting    forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other    limitations typical of an investment grade facility. These    restrictive covenants may limit our future actions, and    financial, operating and strategic flexibility. In addition, our    financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our    credit facility. Our performance and financial condition may not    meet our original expectations, causing us to fail to meet such    financial covenants. Non-compliance with our debt covenants    could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our    revolving credit facility and other bank lines, a circumstance    which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would    most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue    to fund our operations.     In early 2011 we established a commercial paper program which,    subject to market conditions, will allow us to issue up to    $500,000 in aggregate amount of commercial paper outstanding    from time to time as a further source of working capital funding    and liquidity. We did not renew our accounts receivable    securitization facility in January 2011 as we believe issuing    commercial paper can be a more cost effective way for us to    raise short-term funding in the future. However, there is no    guarantee that we will be able to issue commercial paper on    favorable terms, or at all, at any given point in time.     We believe that our cash flow from operations, together with our    cash on hand and access to existing credit facilities or our    commercial paper program, are adequate for current and planned    needs in 2011. However, our actual experience may differ from    these expectations. Factors that may lead to a difference    include, but are not limited to, the matters discussed herein,    as well as future events that might have the effect of reducing    our available cash balance, such as unexpected material    operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures, or    other future events that may reduce or eliminate the    availability of external financial resources.     Not only may our individual financial performance impact our    ability to access sources of external financing, but significant    disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our    ability to obtain financing. Although we believe the risk of    nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial facilities    is not significant, in times of severe economic downturn    and/or    distress in the credit markets, it is possible that one or more    sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to    provide funding to us. In such a situation, it may be that we    would be unable to access funding under our existing credit    facilities, and it might not be possible to find alternative    sources of funding.     We also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to    time, through the issuance of debt securities. Our ability to    issue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will    depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any    ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interest    rates, and the overall condition of the financial and credit    markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit    markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated    significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the    future. Variations in these factors could make it difficult for    us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher    interest rates in order to sell new debt securities. The failure    to receive financing on desirable terms, or at all, could damage    our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or    engage in other business activities.     As of December 26, 2010, we had $1,384,895 of total    principal amount of indebtedness outstanding. If we are unable    to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our    outstanding debt we would need to    16Table of Contents    refinance such debt or face default. There is no guarantee that    we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms, or at all. As a    manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational    corporation, we are subject to various government regulations    and may be subject to additional regulations in the future,    violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise    harm our business. In addition, we could be the subject of    future product liability suits or product recalls, which could    harm our business.     As a manufacturer of consumer products, we are subject to    significant government regulations, including, in the United    States, under The Consumer Products Safety Act, The Federal    Hazardous Substances Act, and The Flammable Fabrics Act, as well    as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our    international markets. In addition, certain of our products are    subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration or    similar international authorities. While we take all the steps    we believe are necessary to comply with these acts, there can be    no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future.    Failure to comply could result in sanctions which could have a    negative impact on our business, financial condition and results    of operations. We may also be subject to involuntary product    recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall. While costs    associated with product recalls have generally not been material    to our business, the costs associated with future product    recalls individually and in the aggregate in any given fiscal    year, could be significant. In addition, any product recall,    regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm consumer    perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our    future revenues and results of operations.     Governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we    manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations    relating to product safety and consumer protection in the    future, and may also increase the penalties for failure to    comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations.    In addition, one or more of our customers might require changes    in our products, such as the non-use of certain materials, in    the future. Complying with any such additional regulations or    requirements could impose increased costs on our business.    Similarly, increased penalties for non-compliance could subject    us to greater expense in the event any of our products were    found to not comply with such regulations. Such increased costs    or penalties could harm our business.     In addition to government regulation, products that have been or    may be developed by us may expose us to potential liability from    personal injury or property damage claims by the users of such    products. There can be no assurance that a claim will not be    brought against us in the future. Any successful claim could    significantly harm our business, financial condition and results    of operations.     As a large, multinational corporation, we are subject to a host    of governmental regulations throughout the world, including    antitrust, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott    regulations, environmental regulations and the Foreign Corrupt    Practices Act. Complying with these regulations imposes costs on    us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to    successfully comply with any such legal requirements could    subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that    could further harm our business and financial condition. Our    business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may    not be able to protect such rights successfully. In addition, we    have a material amount of acquired product rights which, if    impaired, would result in a reduction of our net    earnings.     Our intellectual property, including our license agreements and    other agreements that establish our ownership rights and    maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, are    of great value. We rely on a combination of trade secret,    copyright, trademark, patent and other proprietary rights laws    to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related    to our brands. From time to time, third parties have challenged,    and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our    intellectual property. In addition, our business is subject to    the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or    infringing on our intellectual property rights. We may need to    resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property    rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of    resources. Our failure to protect our intellectual property    rights could harm our business and competitive position. Much of    our intellectual property has been internally developed and has    no carrying value on our balance sheet. However, as of    December 26, 2010, we had $500,597 of acquired product and    17Table of Contents    licensing rights included in other assets on our balance sheet.    Declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed    products may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of    the related assets and could result in an impairment charge.    Reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could    harm our financial results. We may    not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or    investments in joint ventures, or those benefits may be delayed    or reduced in their realization.     Acquisitions have been a significant part of our historical    growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our    product offerings. In making acquisitions, we target companies    that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products    or the ability for us to leverage our entertainment offerings.    In the case of our joint venture with Discovery, we looked to    partner with a company that has shown the ability to establish    and operate compelling entertainment channels. However, we    cannot be certain that the products of companies we may acquire,    or acquire an interest in, in the future will achieve or    maintain popularity with consumers or that any such acquired    companies or investments will allow us to more effectively    market our products. In some cases, we expect that the    integration of the companies that we acquire into our operations    will create production, marketing and other operating synergies    which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and,    where applicable, cost savings, operating efficiencies and other    advantages. However, we cannot be certain that these synergies,    efficiencies and cost savings will be realized. Even if    achieved, these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their    realization. In other cases, we acquire companies that we    believe have strong and creative management, in which case we    plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully    integrating them into our operations. We cannot be certain that    the key talented individuals at these companies will continue to    work for us after the acquisition or that they will develop    popular and profitable products or services in the future. From    time to time, we are involved in litigation, arbitration or    regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which    could entail significant expense.     As is the case with many large multinational corporations, we    are subject, from time to time, to regulatory investigations,    litigation and arbitration disputes. Because the outcome of    litigation, arbitration and regulatory investigations is    inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome    of any of these matters could entail significant expense for us    and harm our business. The fact that we operate in significant    numbers of international markets also increases the risk that we    may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply    with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements. We    have a material amount of goodwill which, if it becomes    impaired, would result in a reduction in our net    earnings.     Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition    exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire. Goodwill is    not amortized and is required to be periodically evaluated for    impairment. At December 26, 2010, $474,813, or 11.6%, of    our total assets represented goodwill. Declines in our    profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units,    which could result in a write-down of our goodwill. Reductions    in our net earnings caused by the write-down of goodwill or our    investment in the joint venture could harm our results of    operations. "

We    undertake no obligation to make any revisions to the    forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on    Form 10-K    or in our annual report to shareholders to reflect events or    circumstances occurring after the date of the filing of this    report. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all dollar or    share amounts herein are expressed in thousands of dollars or    shares, except for per share amounts. The    volatility of ever-evolving consumer preferences, combined with    the high level of competition and low barriers to entry in the    family entertainment industry, make it difficult to maintain and    build upon the success of existing products and product lines or    introduce successful new products. In addition, an inability to    develop and introduce planned new products and product lines in    a timely and cost-effective manner may damage our    business.     The family entertainment business is a fashion industry and    evolves quickly. Our success is critically dependent upon the    consumer appeal of our products. Our failure to successfully    anticipate, identify and react to childrens interests and    the current preferences in family entertainment could    significantly lower sales of our products and harm our business    and profitability.     A decline in the popularity of our existing products and product    lines, or the failure of our new products and product lines to    achieve and sustain interest from retailers and consumers, could    significantly lower our revenues and operating margins, which    would in turn harm our profitability, business and financial    condition. In our industry, it is critical to identify and offer    what are considered to be the next hot toys and    games on childrens wish lists and to    effectively anticipate childrens evolving entertainment    interests. Our continued    8Table of Contents    success will depend on our ability to develop, market and sell    popular toys, games and other entertainment offerings, and    license our brands for products which are sought after by both    children and their parents. We seek to achieve and maintain    market popularity for our products through the continued    re-imagination, re-invigoration and extension of our existing    family entertainment properties in ways we believe will capture    evolving consumer interest and imagination, offer immersive    brand experiences and remain relevant in todays world, and    by developing, introducing and gaining customer interest for new    family entertainment products. This process involves    anticipating and extending successful play patterns, offering    continual product innovation and identifying entertainment    concepts and properties that appeal to childrens    imaginations. However, consumer preferences with respect to    family entertainment are continuously changing and are difficult    to anticipate. Evolving consumer tastes, coupled with an ever    changing pipeline of entertainment properties and products which    compete for consumer interest and acceptance, create an    environment in which some products can fail to achieve consumer    acceptance, and other products can be extremely popular during a    certain period in time but then rapidly be replaced in    consumers minds with other properties. As a result,    individual family entertainment products and properties often    have short consumer life cycles.     Not only must we address rapidly changing consumer tastes and    interests but we face competitors who are also constantly    monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes, seeking    ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new    products that compete with our products for consumer purchasing.    In addition to existing competitors, the barriers to entry for    new participants in the family entertainment industry are low.    New participants with a popular product idea or entertainment    property can gain access to consumers and become a significant    source of competition for our products. In some cases our    competitors products may achieve greater market acceptance    than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products.     The challenge of developing and offering products that are    sought after by children is compounded by the trend of children    getting older younger. By this we mean that children    are expanding their interests beyond traditional toys and games    to a wider array of entertainment products at younger ages and,    as a result, at younger and younger ages, our products compete    with the offerings of video game suppliers, consumer electronics    companies and other businesses outside of the traditional toy    and game industry.     There is no guarantee that:           Any of our current products or product lines will continue to be    popular;           Any property for which we have a significant license will    achieve or sustain popularity;           Any new products or product lines we introduce will be    considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate    market acceptance;           Any new products life cycle will be sufficient to permit    us to profitably recover development, manufacturing, marketing,    royalties (including royalty advances and guarantees) and other    costs of producing, marketing and selling the product; or           We will be able to manufacture, source and ship new or    continuing products in a timely and cost-effective basis to meet    constantly changing consumer demands, a risk that is heightened    by our customers compressed shipping schedules and the    seasonality of our business.     In developing new products and product lines, we have    anticipated dates for the associated product introductions. When    we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a    particular product or product line at a certain time in the    future those expectations are based on completing the associated    development and implementation work in accordance with our    currently anticipated development schedule. Unforeseen delays or    difficulties in the development process, or significant    increases in the planned cost of development, may cause the    introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or,    in some situations, may cause a product introduction to be    discontinued.    9Table of ContentsDelays    or increased costs associated with the development and offering    of entertainment media based upon or related to our brands, or    lack of sufficient consumer interest in such entertainment    media, can harm our business.     As part of our strategy of offering immersive brand experiences,    we look to offer consumers the ability to enjoy our brands in as    many different forms and formats as possible. Entertainment    media, in forms such as motion pictures and television, can    provide popular platforms for consumers to experience our brands    and the success of such media efforts can significantly impact    demand for our products and our financial success.     The success of our products is often dependent on the timelines    and effectiveness of media efforts. Television programming,    movie and DVD releases, comic book releases, and other media    efforts are often critical in generating interest in our    products and brands. Not only our efforts, but the efforts of    third parties, heavily impact the launch dates and success of    these media efforts. When we say that products or brands will be    supported by certain media releases, those statements are based    on our current plans and expectations. Unforeseen factors may    delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation.    Any delay or cancellation of planned product development work,    introductions, or media support may decrease the number of    products we sell and harm our business.     Similarly, if our and our partners media efforts fail to    garner sufficient consumer interest and acceptance, our revenues    and the financial return from such efforts will be harmed. In    2009 we entered into a joint venture with Discovery    Communications, Inc. (Discovery). Through that joint    venture, we are currently working with Discovery to offer a    childrens and family entertainment channel called THE HUB,    which is scheduled to debut in the fall of 2010. In connection    with this joint venture effort, we are also building a virtual    studio, called Hasbro Studios, which will develop and produce    entertainment media based on our brands. Lack of consumer    interest in and acceptance of THE HUB, programming appearing on    THE HUB, other programming developed by Hasbro Studios, and    products related to that programming could significantly harm    our business. Similarly, our business could be harmed by greater    than expected costs, or unexpected delays or difficulties,    associated with the introduction of the rebranded joint venture    network, the development of Hasbro Studios and the creation of    new content based on our brands to appear on the joint venture    network and elsewhere.     At December 27, 2009, $371,783, or 9.5%, of our total    assets represented our investment in the Discovery joint    venture. If the launch of the rebranded television channel is    not successful, or if there are subsequent declines in the    success or profitability of the channel, then our investment may    become impaired, which could result in a write-down through net    earnings. Economic    downturns which negatively impact the retail and credit markets,    or which otherwise damage the financial health of our retail    customers and consumers, can harm our business and financial    performance.     The success of our family entertainment products and our    financial performance is dependent on consumer purchases of our    products. Consumers may not purchase our products because the    products do not capture consumer interest and imagination, or    because competitor family entertainment offerings are deemed    more attractive. But consumer spending on our products can also    be harmed by factors that negatively impact consumers    budgets generally, and which are not due to our product    offerings.     Recessions and other economic downturns, or disruptions in    credit markets, in the markets in which we operate can result in    lower levels of economic activity, lower employment levels, less    consumer disposable income, and lower consumer confidence. Any    of these factors can reduce the amount which consumers spend on    the purchase of our products. This in turn can reduce our    revenues and harm our financial performance.     In addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our    products during times of economic difficulty, in an effort to    maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price    of our products, increase our promotional spending, or take    other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our    products. Those steps may lower our net revenues, decrease our    operating margins, increase our costs    and/or lower    our profitability.    10Table of ContentsOther    economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we    operate, including rising commodity and fuel prices, higher    labor costs, increased transportation costs, outbreaks of public    health pandemics or other diseases, or third party conduct could    negatively impact our ability to produce and ship our products,    and lower our revenues, margins and profitability.     Various economic and public health conditions can impact our    ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and    cost-effective manner, or can otherwise have a significant    negative impact on our business.     Significant increases in the costs of other products which are    required by consumers, such as gasoline, home heating fuels, or    groceries, may reduce household spending on the discretionary    entertainment products we offer. As we discussed above, weakened    economic conditions, lowered employment levels or recessions in    any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer    purchases of our products. Economic conditions may also be    negatively impacted by terrorist attacks, wars and other    conflicts, increases in critical commodity prices, or the    prospect of such events. Such a weakened economic and business    climate, as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a    climate, could harm our revenues and profitability.     Our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand    for our products, but also on our ability to produce and sell    those products at costs which allow for us to make a profit.    Rising fuel and raw material prices, for paperboard and other    components such as resin used in plastics, increased    transportation costs, and increased labor costs in the markets    in which our products are manufactured all may increase the    costs we incur to produce and transport our products, which in    turn may reduce our margins, reduce our profitability and harm    our business.     Other conditions, such as the unavailability of electrical    components, may impede our ability to manufacture, source and    ship new and continuing products on a timely basis. Additional    factors outside of our control could further delay our products    or increase the cost we pay to produce such products. For    example, work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, an outbreak of a    severe public health pandemic, or the occurrence or threat of    wars or other conflicts, all could impact our ability to    manufacture or deliver product. Any of these factors could    result in product delays, increased costs    and/or lost    sales for our products. We may    not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed    material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from    the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum    guaranteed royalties.     In addition to designing and developing products based on our    own brands, we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and    interests by producing products based on popular entertainment    properties developed by other parties and licensed to us. The    success of entertainment properties for which we have a license,    such as MARVEL or STAR WARS related products, can significantly    affect our revenues and profitability. If we produce a line of    products based on a movie or television series, the success of    the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of    consumer interest in the associated products we are offering. In    addition, competition in our industry for access to    entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure,    maintain, and renew popular licenses to entertainment products    on beneficial terms, if at all, and to attract and retain the    talented employees necessary to design, develop and market    successful products based on these properties. The loss of    rights granted pursuant to any of our licensing agreements could    harm our business and competitive position.     The license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually    require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be    substantial, and in some cases may be greater than what we are    ultimately able to recoup from actual sales, which could result    in write-offs of significant amounts which in turn would harm    our results of operations. At December 27, 2009, we had    $120,115 of prepaid royalties, $43,115 of which are included in    prepaid expenses and other current assets and $77,000 of which    are included in other assets. Under the terms of existing    contracts as of December 27, 2009, we may be required to    pay future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees    totaling approximately $331,491. Acquiring or renewing licenses    may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we    consider to be too high to be profitable, which may result in    losing licenses we currently hold when they become available for    renewal, or missing    11Table of Contents    business opportunities for new licenses. Additionally, as a    licensee of entertainment based properties we have no guaranty    that a particular property or brand will translate into    successful toy or game products.     We anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie    releases may make it increasingly difficult for us to profitably    sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may    lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in    order to minimize their inventory risk. Furthermore, there can    be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be    successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future, as    new entertainment properties and competitive products are    continually being introduced to the market. In the event that we    are not able to acquire or maintain successful entertainment    licenses on advantageous terms, our revenues and profits may be    harmed. Our    business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results    will depend, in large part, on our sales during the relatively    brief holiday shopping season. This seasonality is exacerbated    by retailers quick response inventory management    techniques.     Sales of our family entertainment products at retail are    extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring    during the period from September through December in    anticipation of the holiday season, including Christmas. This    seasonality has increased over time, as retailers become more    efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick    response inventory management techniques. Customers are timing    their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers, such as    us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. For toys, games    and other family entertainment products which we produce, a    majority of retail sales for the entire year occur in the fourth    quarter, close to the holiday season. As a consequence, the    majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from    September through December, as our customers do not want to    maintain large on-hand inventories throughout the year ahead of    consumer demand. While these techniques reduce a retailers    investment in inventory, they increase pressure on suppliers    like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant    portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier.     The limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or    delay retail sales, resulting in lower revenues for us. If we or    our customers determine that one of our products is more popular    at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have    sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to    fully capture consumer interest in the product. Additionally,    the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter    time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve    tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce    our sales and harm our financial performance. This seasonal    pattern requires significant use of working capital, mainly to    manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year    prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting    of demand for products during the holiday season in order to    avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing    excess inventory of products that are less popular with    consumers. Our failure to accurately predict and respond to    consumer demand, resulting in our underproducing popular items    and/or    overproducing less popular items, would reduce our total sales    and harm our results of operations. In addition, as a result of    the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly    and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the    impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the    year, by unforeseen events, such as a terrorist attack or    economic shock, that harm the retail environment or consumer    buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events,    such as strikes or port delays, that interfere with the shipment    of goods, particularly from the Far East, during the critical    months leading up to the holiday purchasing season. Our    substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the    United States subject us to risks associated with international    operations. Among these risks is the fact that fluctuations in    foreign exchange rates can significantly impact our financial    performance.     We operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries    outside the United States. For the year ended December 27,    2009, our net revenues from international customers comprised    approximately 42% of our total consolidated net revenues. We    expect our sales to international customers to continue to    account for a significant portion of our revenues. In fact, over    time, we expect our international sales and operations to grow    both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our overall    business as one of our key business strategies is to increase    our presence in emerging and underserved markets. Additionally,    as we discuss below, we utilize    12Table of Contents    third-party manufacturers located principally in the Far East,    to produce the majority of our products, and we have a    manufacturing facility in Ireland. These sales and manufacturing    operations, including operations in emerging markets that we    have entered, may enter, or may increase our presence in, are    subject to the risks associated with international operations,    including:           Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;           Limitations, including taxes, on the repatriation of earnings;           Political instability, civil unrest and economic instability;           Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and    weaker laws protecting such rights;           Complications in complying with different laws in varying    jurisdictions and changes in governmental policies;           Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and expense in    recovering therefrom;           Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country    to another, including port congestion, strikes and other    transportation delays and interruptions;           Changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing    business internationally; and           The imposition of tariffs.     Because of the importance of our international sales and    international sourcing of manufacturing to our business, our    financial condition and results of operations could be    significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to    occur.     If the exchange rate between the United States dollar and a    local currency for an international market in which we have    significant sales or operations changes, our financial results,    reported in U.S. dollars, may be meaningfully impacted even    if our business in the local currency is not significantly    affected. As an example, if the dollar appreciates 10% relative    to a local currency for an international market in which we had    $200 million of net sales, the dollar value of those sales,    as they are translated into U.S. dollars, would decrease by    $20 million in our consolidated financial results. As such,    we would recognize a $20 million decrease in our net    revenues, even if the actual level of sales in the foreign    market had not changed. Similarly, our expenses in foreign    markets can be significantly impacted, in U.S. dollar    terms, by exchange rates, meaning the profitability of our    business in U.S. dollar terms can be significantly harmed    by exchange rate movements. The    concentration of our retail customer base means that economic    difficulties or changes in the purchasing policies of our major    customers could have a significant impact on us.     We depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell    the majority of our products. For the fiscal year ended    December 27, 2009, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Target    Corporation, and Toys R Us, Inc., accounted for    approximately 25%, 13% and 11%, respectively, of our    consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers,    including Wal-Mart, Target and Toys R Us, in the    aggregate accounted for approximately 54% of our consolidated    net revenues. In the U.S. and Canada segment, approximately    74% of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top    three customers. While the consolidation of our customer base    may provide certain benefits to us, such as potentially more    efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of    sales and distribution, this consolidation also means that if    one or more of our major customers were to experience    difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing    business with us, significantly reduce the amount of their    purchases from us or return substantial amounts of our products,    it could significantly harm our sales, profitability and    financial condition. Increased concentration among our customers    could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher    sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross    margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less    consolidation among our customers. In addition, the bankruptcy    or other lack of success of one or more of our significant    retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and result    in higher bad debt expense.    13Table of ContentsOur    use of third-party manufacturers to produce the majority of our    toy products, as well as certain other products, presents risks    to our business.     We own and operate two game and puzzle manufacturing facilities,    one in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts and the other in    Waterford, Ireland. However, most of our toy products, in    addition to certain other products, are manufactured by    third-party manufacturers, most of whom are located in the    Peoples Republic of China. Although our external sources    of manufacturing can be shifted, over a period of time, to    alternative sources of supply, should such changes be necessary,    if we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or    components for a material portion of our product line due to    political, labor or other factors beyond our control, including    natural disasters or pandemics, our operations would be    disrupted, potentially for a significant period of time, while    alternative sources of supply were secured. This delay could    significantly reduce our revenues and profitability, and harm    our business.     Given that the majority of our manufacturing is conducted by    third-party manufacturers located in the Peoples Republic    of China, health conditions and other factors affecting social    and economic activity in China and affecting the movement of    people and products into and from China to our major markets,    including North America and Europe, as well as increases in the    costs of labor and other costs of doing business in China, could    have a significant negative impact on our operations, revenues    and earnings. Factors that could negatively affect our business    include a potential significant revaluation of the Chinese yuan,    which may result in an increase in the cost of producing    products in China, increases in labor costs and difficulties in    moving products manufactured in China out of Asia and through    the ports on the western coast of North America, whether due to    port congestion, labor disputes, product regulations    and/or    inspections or other factors, and natural disasters or health    pandemics impacting China. Also, the imposition of trade    sanctions or other regulations by the United States or the    European Union against products imported by us from, or the loss    of normal trade relations status with, the    Peoples Republic of China, could significantly increase    our cost of products imported into the United States or Europe    and harm our business. Additionally, the suspension of the    operations of a third party manufacturer by government    inspectors in China could result in delays to us in obtaining    product and may harm sales.     We require our third-party manufacturers to comply with our    Global Business Ethics Principles, which are designed to prevent    products manufactured by or for us from being produced under    inhumane or exploitive conditions. The Global Business Ethics    Principles address a number of issues, including working hours    and compensation, health and safety, and abuse and    discrimination. In addition, Hasbro requires that our products    supplied by third-party manufacturers be produced in compliance    with all applicable laws and regulations, including consumer and    product safety laws in the markets where those products are    sold. Hasbro has the right, both directly and through the use of    outside monitors, to monitor compliance by our third-party    manufacturers with our Global Business Ethics Principles and    other manufacturing requirements. In addition, we do quality    assurance testing on our products, including products    manufactured for us by third parties. Notwithstanding these    requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with    them, there is always a risk that one or more of our third-party    manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we    will not immediately discover such non-compliance. Any failure    of our third-party manufacturers to comply with labor, consumer,    product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing    products for us could result in damage to our reputation, harm    sales of our products and potentially create liability for us. Part    of our strategy for remaining relevant to children is to offer    innovative childrens toy and game electronic products. The    margins on many of these products are lower than more    traditional toys and games and such products may have a shorter    lifespan than more traditional toys and games. As a result,    sales of childrens toy and game electronic products may    lower our overall operating margins and produce more volatility    in our business.     As children have grown older younger and have    otherwise become interested in more and more sophisticated and    adult products, such as videogames and consumer electronics, at    younger and younger ages, we have sought to keep our products    relevant for these consumers. One initiative we have pursued to    capture the interest of children is to offer innovative    childrens electronic toys and games. Examples of such    products in the last few years include our I-branded products    such as I-DOG and I-CAT, and our FURREAL FRIENDS    14Table of Contents    line of products, including BUTTERSCOTCH PONY, BISCUIT MY    LOVIN PUP and KOTA. These products, if successful, can be    an effective way for us to connect with consumers and increase    sales. However, childrens electronics, in addition to the    risks associated with our other family entertainment products,    also face certain additional risks.     Our costs for designing, developing and producing electronic    products tend to be higher than for many of our other more    traditional products, such as board games and action figures.    The ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient    sales quantities and to reflect higher costs in higher prices is    constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and    entertainment products, and can be further constrained by    difficult economic conditions. As a consequence, our margins on    the sales of electronic products tend to be lower than for more    traditional products and we can face increased risk of not    achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs. In addition,    the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in    the electronics area is potentially even greater than for our    other products. This pace of change means that the window in    which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may    be even shorter than traditional toys and games. We    rely on external financing, including our credit facilities and    accounts receivable securitization facility, to help fund our    operations. If we were unable to obtain or service such    financing, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were    too burdensome, our business would be harmed.     Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our    working capital needs, particularly those in the third and    fourth quarters, we rely on our revolving credit facility and    our other credit facilities for working capital. We currently    have a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2011, which    provides for a $300,000 committed revolving credit facility    which provides the Company the ability to request increases in    the committed facility in additional increments of $50,000,    subject to lender agreement, up to a total of $500,000. The    credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting    forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other    limitations typical of an investment grade facility. These    restrictive covenants may limit our future actions, and    financial, operating and strategic flexibility. In addition, our    financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our    credit facility. Our performance and financial condition may not    meet our original expectations, causing us to fail to meet such    financial covenants. Non-compliance with our debt covenants    could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our    revolving credit facility and other bank lines, a circumstance    which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would    most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue    to fund our operations.     As an additional source of working capital and liquidity, we    currently have a $250,000 accounts receivable securitization    program. Under this program, we sell on an ongoing basis,    substantially all of our domestic U.S. dollar denominated    trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote special purpose    entity. Under this facility, the special purpose entity is able    to sell, on a revolving basis, undivided ownership interests in    the eligible receivables to bank conduits. During the term of    the facility, we must maintain certain performance ratios. If we    fail to maintain these ratios, we could be prevented from    accessing this cost-effective source of working capital and    short-term financing. Additionally, changes in financial    reporting, regulatory or other requirements which went into    effect in 2010 or may occur in the future may significantly    increase the cost of our accounts receivable securitization    facility, which could make use of such a facility uneconomical.     We believe that our cash flow from operations, together with our    cash on hand and access to existing credit facilities and our    accounts receivable securitization facility, are adequate for    current and planned needs in 2010. However, our actual    experience may differ from these expectations. Factors that may    lead to a difference include, but are not limited to, the    matters discussed herein, as well as future events that might    have the effect of reducing our available cash balance, such as    unexpected material operating losses or increased capital or    other expenditures, as well as increases in inventory or    accounts receivable that are ineligible for sale under our    securitization facility, regulatory or accounting changes which    make accounts receivable securitization facilities more    expensive or otherwise less desirable as sources of working    capital funding, or other future events that may reduce or    eliminate the availability of external financial resources.     Not only may our individual financial performance impact our    ability to access sources of external financing, but significant    disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our    ability to obtain financing.    15Table of Contents    Although we believe the risk of nonperformance by the    counterparties to our financial facilities is not significant,    in times of severe economic downturn    and/or    distress in the credit markets, it is possible that one or more    sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to    provide funding to us. In such a situation, it may be that we    would be unable to access funding under our existing credit    facilities, and it might not be possible to find alternative    sources of funding.     We also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to    time, through the issuance of debt securities. Our ability to    issue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will    depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any    ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interest    rates, and the overall condition of the financial and credit    markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit    markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated    significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the    future. Variations in these factors could make it difficult for    us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher    interest rates in order to sell new debt securities. The failure    to receive financing on desirable terms, or at all, could damage    our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or    engage in other business activities.     As of December 27, 2009, we had $1,134,723 of total    principal amount of indebtedness outstanding. If we are unable    to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our    outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face    default. There is no guarantee that we would be able to    refinance debt on favorable terms, or at all. This total    indebtedness includes $249,828 in aggregate principal amount of    2.75% senior convertible debentures that we issued in 2001.    On December 1, 2011 and December 1, 2016, and upon the    occurrence of certain fundamental corporate changes, holders of    the 2.75% senior convertible debentures may require us to    purchase their debentures. At that time, the purchase price may    be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the    two, at our discretion, provided that we will pay accrued and    unpaid interest in cash. We may not have sufficient cash at that    time to make the required repurchases and may be required to    settle in shares of common stock. As a    manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational    corporation, we are subject to various government regulations    and may be subject to additional regulations in the future,    violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise    harm our business. In addition, we could be the subject of    future product liability suits or product recalls, which could    harm our business.     As a manufacturer of consumer products, we are subject to    significant government regulations, including, in the United    States, under The Consumer Products Safety Act, The Federal    Hazardous Substances Act, and The Flammable Fabrics Act, as well    as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our    international markets. In addition, certain of our products are    subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration or    similar international authorities. While we take all the steps    we believe are necessary to comply with these acts, there can be    no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future.    Failure to comply could result in sanctions which could have a    negative impact on our business, financial condition and results    of operations. We may also be subject to involuntary product    recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall. While costs    associated with product recalls have generally not been material    to our business, the costs associated with future product    recalls individually and in the aggregate in any given fiscal    year, could be significant. In addition, any product recall,    regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm consumer    perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our    future revenues and results of operations.     Governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we    manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations    relating to product safety and consumer protection in the    future, and may also increase the penalties for failure to    comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations.    In addition, one or more of our customers might require changes    in our products, such as the non-use of certain materials, in    the future. Complying with any such additional regulations or    requirements could impose increased costs on our business.    Similarly, increased penalties for non-compliance could subject    us to greater expense in the event any of our products were    found to not comply with such regulations. Such increased costs    or penalties could harm our business.    16Table of Contents    In addition to government regulation, products that have been or    may be developed by us may expose us to potential liability from    personal injury or property damage claims by the users of such    products. There can be no assurance that a claim will not be    brought against us in the future. Any successful claim could    significantly harm our business, financial condition and results    of operations.     As a large, multinational corporation, we are subject to a host    of governmental regulations throughout the world, including    antitrust, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott    regulations, environmental regulations and the Foreign Corrupt    Practices Act. Complying with these regulations imposes costs on    us which can reduce our profitability and our failure to    successfully comply with any such legal requirements could    subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that    could further harm our business and financial condition. Our    business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may    not be able to protect such rights successfully. In addition, we    have a material amount of acquired product rights which, if    impaired, would result in a reduction of our net    earnings.     Our intellectual property, including our license agreements and    other agreements that establish our ownership rights and    maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, are    of great value. We rely on a combination of trade secret,    copyright, trademark, patent and other proprietary rights laws    to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related    to our brands. From time to time, third parties have challenged,    and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our    intellectual property. In addition, our business is subject to    the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or    infringing on our intellectual property rights. We may need to    resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property    rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of    resources. Our failure to protect our intellectual property    rights could harm our business and competitive position. Much of    our intellectual property has been internally developed and has    no carrying value on our balance sheet. However, as of    December 27, 2009, we had $554,567 of acquired product and    licensing rights included in other assets on our balance sheet.    Declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed    products may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of    the related assets and could result in an impairment charge.    Reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could    harm our financial results. We may    not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or    investments in joint ventures, or those benefits may be delayed    or reduced in their realization.     Acquisitions have been a significant part of our historical    growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our    product offerings. In making acquisitions, we target companies    that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products    or the ability for us to leverage our entertainment offerings.    In the case of our joint venture with Discovery Communications,    Inc., we looked to partner with a company that has shown the    ability to establish and operate compelling entertainment    channels. However, we cannot be certain that the products of    companies we may acquire, or acquire an interest in, in the    future will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers or    that any such acquired companies or investments will allow us to    more effectively market our products. In some cases, we expect    that the integration of the companies that we acquire into our    operations will create production, marketing and other operating    synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and    profitability and, where applicable, cost savings, operating    efficiencies and other advantages. However, we cannot be certain    that these synergies, efficiencies and cost savings will be    realized. Even if achieved, these benefits may be delayed or    reduced in their realization. In other cases, we acquire    companies that we believe have strong and creative management,    in which case we plan to operate them more autonomously rather    than fully integrating them into our operations. We cannot be    certain that the key talented individuals at these companies    will continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they    will develop popular and profitable products or services in the    future. From    time to time, we are involved in litigation, arbitration or    regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which    could entail significant expense.     As is the case with many large multinational corporations, we    are subject, from time to time, to regulatory investigations,    litigation and arbitration disputes. Because the outcome of    litigation, arbitration and regulatory    17Table of Contents    investigations is inherently difficult to predict, it is    possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail    significant expense for us and harm our business. The fact that    we operate in significant numbers of international markets also    increases the risk that we may face legal and regulatory    exposures as we attempt to comply with a large number of varying    legal and regulatory requirements. We    have a material amount of goodwill which, if it becomes    impaired, would result in a reduction in our net    earnings.     Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition    exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire. Goodwill is    not amortized and is required to be periodically evaluated for    impairment. At December 27, 2009, $475,931, or 12.2%, of    our total assets represented goodwill. Declines in our    profitability may impact the fair value of our reporting units,    which could result in a write-down of our goodwill. Reductions    in our net earnings caused by the write-down of goodwill or our    investment in the joint venture could harm our results of    operations. "

 That May Affect Future    Results     From time to time, including in this Annual Report on    Form 10-K    and in our annual report to shareholders, we publish    forward-looking statements within the meaning of the    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These    forward-looking statements may relate to such    matters as our anticipated financial performance or business    prospects in future periods, expected technological and product    developments, the expected timing of new product introductions    or our expectations concerning the future acceptance of products    by customers, the timing of entertainment releases, marketing    and promotional efforts, research and development activities,    liquidity, and similar matters. Forward-looking statements are    inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. The Private    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor    for forward-looking statements. These statements may be    identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such    as anticipate, believe,    could, expect, intend,    looking forward, may,    planned, potential, should,    will and would or any variations of    words with similar meanings. We note that a variety of factors    could cause our actual results and experience to differ    materially from the anticipated results or other expectations    expressed or anticipated in our forward-looking statements. The    factors listed below are illustrative and other risks and    uncertainties may arise as are or may be detailed from time to    time in our public announcements and our filings with the    Securities and Exchange Commission, such as on    Forms 8-K,10-Q and    10-K. We    undertake no obligation to make any revisions to the    forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on    Form 10-K    or in our annual report to shareholders to reflect events or    circumstances occurring after the date of the filing of this    report. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all dollar or    share amounts herein are expressed in thousands of dollars or    shares, except for per share amounts. The    volatility of consumer preferences, combined with the high level    of competition and low barriers to entry in the family    entertainment industry, make it difficult to maintain the    success of existing products and product lines or introduce    successful new products. In addition, an inability to develop    and introduce planned new products and product lines in a timely    and cost-effective manner may damage our business.     The family entertainment business is a fashion industry. Our    success is critically dependent upon the consumer appeal of our    products, principally games and toys. Our failure to    successfully anticipate, identify and react to childrens    interests and the current preferences in family entertainment    could significantly lower sales of our products and harm our    sales and profitability.     A decline in the popularity of our existing products and product    lines, or the failure of our new products and product lines to    achieve and sustain market acceptance with retailers and    consumers, could significantly lower our revenues and operating    margins, which would in turn harm our profitability, business    and financial condition. In our industry, it is important to    identify and offer what are considered to be the hot    toys and games on childrens wish lists. Our    continued success will depend on our ability to develop, market    and sell popular toys and games and license our brands for    products which are sought after by both children and their    parents. We seek to achieve and maintain market popularity for    our products through the redesign and extension of our existing    family entertainment properties in ways we believe will capture    evolving consumer interest and imagination and remain relevant    in todays world, and by developing, introducing and    gaining customer interest for new family entertainment products.    This process involves anticipating and extending successful play    patterns and identifying entertainment concepts and properties    that appeal to childrens imaginations. However, consumer    preferences with respect to family entertainment are    continuously changing and are difficult to anticipate. Evolving    consumer tastes, coupled with an ever changing pipeline of    entertainment properties and products which compete for consumer    interest and acceptance, creates an environment in which    products can be extremely popular during a certain period in    time but then rapidly be replaced in consumers minds with    other properties. As a result, individual family entertainment    products and properties often have short consumer life cycles.     Not only must we address rapidly changing consumer tastes and    interests but we face competitors who are also constantly    monitoring consumer tastes, seeking ideas which will appeal to    consumers and introducing new products that compete with our    products for consumer purchasing. In addition to existing    competitors, the    8Table of Contents    barriers to entry for new participants in the family    entertainment industry are low. New participants with a popular    product idea or entertainment property can gain access to    consumers and become a significant source of competition for our    products. In some cases our competitors products may    achieve greater market acceptance than our products and    potentially reduce demand for our products.     The challenge of developing and offering products that are    sought after by children is compounded by the trend of children    getting older younger. By this we mean that children    are losing interest in traditional toys and games at younger    ages and, as a result, at younger and younger ages, our products    compete with the offerings of video game suppliers, consumer    electronics companies and other businesses outside of the    traditional toy and game industry.     There is no guarantee that:           Any of our current products or product lines will continue to be    popular;           Any property for which we have a significant license will    achieve or sustain popularity;           Any new products or product lines we introduce will be    considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate    market acceptance;           Any new products life cycle will be sufficient to permit    us to profitably recover development, manufacturing, marketing,    royalties (including royalty advances and guarantees) and other    costs of producing, marketing and selling the product; or           We will be able to manufacture, source and ship new or    continuing products in a timely and cost-effective basis to meet    constantly changing consumer demands, a risk that is heightened    by our customers compressed shipping schedules and the    seasonality of our business.     In developing new products and product lines, we have    anticipated dates for the associated product introductions. When    we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a    particular product or product line at a certain time in the    future those expectations are based on completing the associated    development and implementation work in accordance with our    currently anticipated development schedule. Unforeseen delays or    difficulties in the development process, or significant    increases in the planned cost of development, may cause the    introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or,    in some situations, may cause a product introduction to be    discontinued.     Similarly, the success of our products is often dependent on the    timelines and effectiveness of related advertising and media    efforts. Television programming, movie and DVD releases, comic    book releases, and other media efforts are often critical in    generating interest in our products. Not only our efforts, but    the efforts of third parties, heavily impact the launch dates    and success of these media efforts. When we say that products or    brands will be supported by certain media releases, those    statements are based on our current plans and expectations.    Unforeseen factors may delay these media releases or even lead    to their cancellation. Any delay or cancellation of planned    product development work, introductions, or media support may    decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business. Economic    downturns which negatively impact the retail and credit markets,    or which otherwise damage the financial health of our retail    customers and consumers, can harm our business and financial    performance.     The success of our family entertainment products and our    financial performance is dependent on consumer purchases of our    products. Consumers may not purchase our products because the    products do not capture consumer interest and imagination, or    because competitor family entertainment offerings are deemed    more attractive. But consumer spending on our products can also    be harmed by factors that negatively impact consumers    budgets generally, and which are not due to our product    offerings.     Recessions and other economic downturns, or disruptions in    credit markets, in the markets in which we operate can result in    lower levels of economic activity, lower employment levels, less    consumer disposable    9Table of Contents    income, and lower consumer confidence. Any of these factors can    reduce the amount which consumers spend on the purchase of our    products. This in turn can reduce our revenues and harm our    financial performance.     In addition to experiencing potentially lower revenues from our    products during times of economic difficulty, in an effort to    maintain sales during such times we may need to reduce the price    of our products, increase our promotional spending, or take    other steps to encourage retailer and consumer purchase of our    products. Those steps may lower our net revenues, decrease our    operating margins, increase our costs    and/or lower    our profitability. Other    economic and public health conditions in the markets in which we    operate, including rising commodity and fuel prices, higher    labor costs, increased transportation costs, outbreaks of SARs    or other diseases, or third party conduct could negatively    impact our ability to produce and ship our products, and lower    our revenues, margins and profitability.     Various economic and public health conditions can impact our    ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and    cost-effective manner, or can otherwise have a significant    negative impact on our business.     Significant increases in the costs of other products which are    required by consumers, such as gasoline, home heating fuels, or    groceries, may reduce household spending on the discretionary    entertainment products we offer. As we discussed above, weakened    economic conditions, lowered employment levels or recessions in    any of our major markets may significantly reduce consumer    purchases of our products. Economic conditions may also be    negatively impacted by terrorist attacks, wars and other    conflicts, increases in critical commodity prices, or the    prospect of such events. Such a weakened economic and business    climate, as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a    climate, could harm our revenues and profitability.     Our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand    for our products, but also on our ability to produce and sell    those products at costs which allow for profitable revenues.    Rising fuel and raw material prices, for components such as    resin used in plastics, increased transportation costs, and    increased labor costs in the markets in which our products are    manufactured all may increase the costs we incur to produce and    transport our products, which in turn may reduce our margins,    reduce our profitability and harm our business.     Other conditions, such as the unavailability of electrical    components, may impede our ability to manufacture, source and    ship new and continuing products on a timely basis. Additional    factors outside of our control could further delay our products    or increase the cost we pay to produce such products. For    example, work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, an outbreak of    SARs or another severe public health pandemic, or the occurrence    or threat of wars or other conflicts, all could impact our    ability to manufacture or deliver product. Any of these factors    could result in product delays, increased costs    and/or lost    sales for our products. We may    not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed    material has less market appeal than expected or if revenue from    the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum    guaranteed royalties.     In addition to designing and developing products based on our    own brands, we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and    interests by producing products based on popular entertainment    properties developed by other parties and licensed to us. The    success of entertainment properties released theatrically for    which we have a license, such as MARVEL or STAR WARS related    products, can significantly affect our revenues and    profitability. If we produce a line of products based on a movie    or television series, the success of the movie or series has a    critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the    associated products we are offering. In addition, competition in    our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen    our ability to secure, maintain, and renew popular licenses to    entertainment products on beneficial terms, if at all, and to    attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design,    develop and market successful products based on these    properties. The loss of rights granted pursuant to any of our    licensing agreements could harm our business and competitive    position.    10Table of Contents    The license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually    require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be    substantial, and in some cases may be greater than what we are    ultimately able to recoup from actual sales, which could result    in write-offs of significant amounts which in turn would harm    our results of operations. At December 28, 2008, we had    $71,000 of prepaid royalties, $44,300 of which are included in    prepaid expenses and other current assets and $26,700 of which    are included in other assets. Under the terms of existing    contracts as of December 28, 2008, we may be required to    pay future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees    totaling approximately $57,818. Acquiring or renewing licenses    may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we    consider to be too high to be profitable, which may result in    losing licenses we currently hold when they become available for    renewal, or missing business opportunities for new licenses.    Additionally, as a licensee of entertainment based properties we    have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will    translate into successful toy or game products.     We anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie    releases will make it increasingly difficult for us to    profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment    properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for    these products in order to minimize their inventory risk.    Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a successful brand    will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales    in the future, as new entertainment properties and competitive    products are continually being introduced to the market. In the    event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful    entertainment licenses on advantageous terms, our revenues and    profits may be harmed. Our    business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results    will depend, in large part, on our sales during the relatively    brief holiday shopping season. This seasonality is exacerbated    as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory    levels through quick response inventory management    techniques.     Sales of our family entertainment products at retail are    extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring    during the period from September through December in    anticipation of the holiday season, including Christmas. This    seasonality has increased over time, as retailers become more    efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick    response inventory management techniques. These customers are    timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers,    such as us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. For    toys, games and other family entertainment products which we    produce, a majority of retail sales for the entire year occur in    the fourth quarter, close to the holiday season. As a    consequence, the majority of our sales to our customers occur in    the period from September through December, as our customers do    not want to maintain large on-hand inventories throughout the    year ahead of consumer demand. While these techniques reduce a    retailers investment in inventory, they increase pressure    on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a    significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the    supplier.     The limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or    delay retail sales, resulting in lower revenues for us. If we or    our customers determine that one of our products is more popular    at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have    sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to    fully capture consumer interest in the product. Additionally,    the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter    time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve    tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce    our sales and harm our financial performance. This seasonal    pattern requires significant use of working capital, mainly to    manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year    prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting    of demand for products during the holiday season in order to    avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing    excess inventory of products that are less popular with    consumers. Our failure to accurately predict and respond to    consumer demand, resulting in our underproducing popular items    and/or    overproducing less popular items, would reduce our total sales    and harm our results of operations. In addition, as a result of    the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly    and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the    impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the    year, by unforeseen events, such as a terrorist attack or    economic shock, that harm the retail environment or consumer    buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events,    such as strikes or port delays, that interfere with the shipment    of goods, particularly from the Far East, during the critical    months leading up to the holiday purchasing season.    11Table of ContentsOur    substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the    United States subject us to risks associated with international    operations. Among these risks is the fact that fluctuations in    foreign exchange rates can significantly impact our financial    performance.     We operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries    outside the United States. For the year ended December 28,    2008, our net revenues from international customers comprised    approximately 42% of our total consolidated net revenues. We    expect our sales to international customers to continue to    account for a significant portion of our revenues. Additionally,    as we discuss below, we utilize third-party manufacturers    located principally in the Far East, to produce the majority of    our products, and we have a manufacturing facility in Ireland.    These sales and manufacturing operations are subject to the    risks associated with international operations, including:           Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;           Limitations, including taxes, on the repatriation of earnings;           Political instability, civil unrest and economic instability;           Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and    weaker laws protecting such rights;           Complications in complying with different laws in varying    jurisdictions and changes in governmental policies;           Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and expense in    recovering therefrom;           Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country    to another, including port congestion, strikes and other    transportation delays and interruptions;           Changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing    business internationally; and           The imposition of tariffs.     Because of the importance of our international sales and    international sourcing of manufacturing to our business, our    financial condition and results of operations could be    significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to    occur.     If the exchange rate between the United States dollar and a    local currency for an international market in which we have    significant sales or operations changes, our financial results,    reported in U.S. dollars, may be meaningfully impacted even    if our business in the local currency is not significantly    affected. As an example, if the dollar appreciates 10% relative    to a local currency for an international market in which we had    $200 million of net sales, the dollar value of those sales,    as they are translated into U.S. dollars, would decrease by    $20 million in our consolidated financial results. As such,    we would recognize a $20 million decrease in our net    revenues, even if the actual level of sales in the foreign    market had not changed. Similarly, our expenses in foreign    markets can be significantly impacted, in U.S. dollar    terms, by exchange rates, meaning the profitability of our    business in U.S. dollar terms can be significantly harmed    by exchange rate movements. The    consolidation of our retail customer base means that economic    difficulties or changes in the purchasing policies of our major    customers could have a significant impact on us.     We depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell    the majority of our products. For the fiscal year ended    December 28, 2008, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Target    Corporation, and Toys R Us, Inc., accounted for    approximately 25%, 12% and 10%, respectively, of our    consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers,    including Wal-Mart, Target and Toys R Us, in the    aggregate accounted for approximately 52% of our consolidated    net revenues. In the U.S. and Canada segment, approximately    71% of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top    three customers. While the consolidation of our customer base    may provide certain benefits to us, such as potentially more    efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of    sales and distribution, this consolidation also means that if    one or more of our major customers were to experience    difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing    business with us, significantly reduce    12Table of Contents    the amount of their purchases from us or return substantial    amounts of our products, it could significantly harm our sales,    profitability and financial condition. Increased concentration    among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to    negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result    in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there    were less consolidation among our customers. In addition, the    bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our    significant retail customers could negatively impact our    revenues and bad debt expense. Our    use of third-party manufacturers to produce the majority of our    toy products, as well as certain other products, presents risks    to our business.     We own and operate two game and puzzle manufacturing facilities,    one in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts and the other in    Waterford, Ireland. However, most of our toy products, in    addition to certain other products, are manufactured by    third-party manufacturers, most of whom are located in the    Peoples Republic of China. Although our external sources    of manufacturing can be shifted, over a period of time, to    alternative sources of supply, should such changes be necessary,    if we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or    components for a material portion of our product line due to    political, labor or other factors beyond our control, our    operations would be disrupted, potentially for a significant    period of time, while alternative sources of supply were    secured. This delay could significantly reduce our revenues and    profitability, and harm our business.     Given that the majority of our manufacturing is conducted by    third-party manufacturers located in the Peoples Republic    of China, health conditions and other factors affecting social    and economic activity in China and affecting the movement of    people and products into and from China to our major markets,    including North America and Europe, as well as increases in the    costs of labor and other costs of doing business in China, could    have a significant negative impact on our operations, revenues    and earnings. Factors that could negatively affect our business    include a potential significant revaluation of the Chinese yuan,    which may result in an increase in the cost of producing    products in China, increases in labor costs and difficulties in    moving products manufactured in China out of Asia and through    the ports on the western coast of North America, whether due to    port congestion, labor disputes, product regulations    and/or    inspections or other factors. Also, the imposition of trade    sanctions or other regulations by the United States or the    European Union against products imported by us from, or the loss    of normal trade relations status with, the    Peoples Republic of China, could significantly increase    our cost of products imported into the United States or Europe    and harm our business. Additionally, the suspension of the    operations of a third party manufacturer by government    inspectors in China could result in delays to us in obtaining    product and may harm sales.     We require our third-party manufacturers to comply with our    Global Business Ethics Principles, which are designed to prevent    products manufactured by or for us from being produced under    inhumane or exploitive conditions. The Global Business Ethics    Principles address a number of issues, including working hours    and compensation, health and safety, and abuse and    discrimination. In addition, Hasbro requires that our products    supplied by third-party manufacturers be produced in compliance    with all applicable laws and regulations, including consumer and    product safety laws in the markets where those products are    sold. Hasbro has the right, both directly and through the use of    outside monitors, to monitor compliance by our third-party    manufacturers with our Global Business Ethics Principles and    other manufacturing requirements. In addition, we do quality    assurance testing on our products, including products    manufactured for us by third parties. Notwithstanding these    requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with    them, there is always a risk that one or more of our third-party    manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we    will not immediately discover such non-compliance. Any failure    of our third-party manufacturers to comply with labor, consumer,    product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing    products for us could result in damage to our reputation, harm    sales of our products and potentially create liability for us.    13Table of ContentsPart    of our strategy for remaining relevant to older children is to    offer innovative childrens toy and game electronic    products. The margins on many of these products are lower than    more traditional toys and games and such products may have a    shorter lifespan than more traditional toys and games. As a    result, sales of childrens toy and game electronic    products may lower our overall operating margins and produce    more volatility in our business.     As children have grown older younger and have become    interested in more and more sophisticated and adult products,    such as videogames and consumer electronics, at younger and    younger ages, we have needed to work even harder to keep our    products relevant for these consumers. One initiative we have    pursued to capture the interest of older children is to offer    innovative childrens electronic toys and games. Examples    of such products in the last few years include VIDEONOW,    CHATNOW, ZOOMBOX, our I-branded products such as I-DOG and    I-CAT, and our FURREAL FRIENDS line of products, including    BUTTERSCOTCH, BISCUIT and KOTA. These products, if successful,    can be an effective way for us to connect with consumers and    increase sales. However, childrens electronics, in    addition to the risks associated with our other family    entertainment products, also face certain additional risks.     Our costs for designing, developing and producing electronic    products tend to be higher than for many of our other more    traditional products, such as board games and action figures.    The ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient    sales quantities and to reflect higher costs in higher prices is    constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics and    entertainment products, and can be further constrained by    difficult economic conditions. As a consequence, our margins on    the sales of electronic products tend to be lower than for more    traditional products and we can face increased risk of not    achieving sales sufficient to recover our costs. In addition,    the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in    the electronics area is potentially even greater than for our    other products. This pace of change means that the window in    which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may    be even shorter. We    rely on external financing, including our credit facilities and    accounts receivable securitization facility, to help fund our    operations. If we were unable to obtain or service such    financing, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were    too burdensome, our business would be harmed.     Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our    working capital needs, particularly those in the third and    fourth quarters, we rely on our revolving credit facility and    our other credit facilities for working capital. We currently    have a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2011, which    provides for a $300,000 committed revolving credit facility    which provides the Company the ability to request increases in    the committed facility in additional increments of $50,000,    subject to lender agreement, up to a total of $500,000. The    credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting    forth leverage and coverage requirements, and certain other    limitations typical of an investment grade facility. These    restrictive covenants may limit our future actions, and    financial, operating and strategic flexibility. In addition, our    financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our    credit facility. Our performance and financial condition may not    meet our original expectations, causing us to fail to meet such    financial covenants. Non-compliance with our debt covenants    could result in us being unable to utilize borrowings under our    revolving credit facility and other bank lines, a circumstance    which potentially could occur when operating shortfalls would    most require supplementary borrowings to enable us to continue    to fund our operations.     As an additional source of working capital and liquidity, we    currently have a $250,000 accounts receivable securitization    program, which is increased to $300,000 for the period from    fiscal October through fiscal January. Under this program, we    sell on an ongoing basis, substantially all of our domestic    U.S. dollar denominated trade accounts receivable to a    bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. Under this facility,    the special purpose entity is able to sell, on a revolving    basis, undivided ownership interests in the eligible receivables    to bank conduits. During the term of the facility, we must    maintain certain performance ratios. If we fail to maintain    these ratios, we could be prevented from accessing this    cost-effective source of working capital and short-term    financing.     We believe that our cash flow from operations, together with our    cash on hand and access to existing credit facilities and our    accounts receivable securitization facility, are adequate for    current and planned needs    14Table of Contents    in 2009. However, our actual experience may differ from these    expectations. Factors that may lead to a difference include, but    are not limited to, the matters discussed herein, as well as    future events that might have the effect of reducing our    available cash balance, such as unexpected material operating    losses or increased capital or other expenditures, as well as    increases in inventory or accounts receivable that are    ineligible for sale under our securitization facility, or future    events that may reduce or eliminate the availability of external    financial resources.     Not only may our individual financial performance impact our    ability to access sources of external financing, but significant    disruptions to credit markets in general may also harm our    ability to obtain financing. Although we believe the risk of    nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial facilities    is not significant, in times of severe economic downturn    and/or    distress in the credit markets, it is possible that one or more    sources of external financing may be unable or unwilling to    provide funding to us. In such a situation, it may be that we    would be unable to access funding under our existing credit    facilities, and it might not be possible to find alternative    sources of funding.     We also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to    time, through the issuance of debt securities. Our ability to    issue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will    depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any    ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interest    rates, and the overall condition of the financial and credit    markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit    markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated    significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the    future. Variations in these factors could make it difficult for    us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher    interest rates in order to sell new debt securities. The failure    to receive financing on desirable terms, or at all, could damage    our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or    engage in other business activities.     As of December 28, 2008, we had $709,723 of total principal    amount of indebtedness outstanding. If we are unable to generate    sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt    we would need to refinance such debt or face default. There is    no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on    favorable terms, or at all. This total indebtedness includes    $249,828 in aggregate principal amount of 2.75% senior    convertible debentures that we issued in 2001. On    December 1, 2011 and December 1, 2016, and upon the    occurrence of certain fundamental corporate changes, holders of    the 2.75% senior convertible debentures may require us to    purchase their debentures. At that time, the purchase price may    be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the    two, at our discretion, provided that we will pay accrued and    unpaid interest in cash. We may not have sufficient cash at that    time to make the required repurchases and may be required to    settle in shares of common stock. As a    manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational    corporation, we are subject to various government regulations    and may be subject to additional regulations in the future,    violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise    harm our business. In addition, we could be the subject of    future product liability suits or product recalls, which could    harm our business.     As a manufacturer of consumer products, we are subject to    significant government regulations, including, in the United    States, under The Consumer Products Safety Act, The Federal    Hazardous Substances Act, and The Flammable Fabrics Act, as well    as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our    international markets. In addition, certain of our products are    subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration or    similar international authorities. While we take all the steps    we believe are necessary to comply with these acts, there can be    no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future.    Failure to comply could result in sanctions which could have a    negative impact on our business, financial condition and results    of operations. We may also be subject to involuntary product    recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall. While costs    associated with product recalls have generally not been material    to our business, the costs associated with future product    recalls individually and in the aggregate in any given fiscal    year, could be significant. In addition, any product recall,    regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm consumer    perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our    future revenues and results of operations.    15Table of Contents    Governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we    manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations    relating to product safety and consumer protection in the    future, and may also increase the penalties for failure to    comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations.    In addition, one or more of our customers might require changes    in our products, such as the non-use of certain materials, in    the future. Complying with any such additional regulations or    requirements could impose increased costs on our business.    Similarly, increased penalties for non-compliance could subject    us to greater expense in the event any of our products were    found to not comply with such regulations. Such increased costs    or penalties could harm our business.     In addition to government regulation, products that have been or    may be developed by us may expose us to potential liability from    personal injury or property damage claims by the users of such    products. There can be no assurance that a claim will not be    brought against us in the future. Any successful claim could    significantly harm our business, financial condition and results    of operations.     As a large, multinational corporation, we are subject to a host    of governmental regulations throughout the world, including    antitrust, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott    regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Our failure    to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could    subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that    could harm our business and financial condition. Our    business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may    not be able to protect such rights successfully. In addition, we    have a material amount of acquired product rights which, if    impaired, would result in a reduction of our net    earnings.     Our intellectual property, including our license agreements and    other agreements that establish our ownership rights and    maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, are    of great value. We rely on a combination of trade secret,    copyright, trademark, patent and other proprietary rights laws    to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related    to our brands. From time to time, third parties have challenged,    and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our    intellectual property. In addition, our business is subject to    the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or    infringing on our intellectual property rights. We may need to    resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property    rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of    resources. Our failure to protect our intellectual property    rights could harm our business and competitive position. Much of    our intellectual property has been internally developed and has    no carrying value on our balance sheet. However, as of    December 28, 2008, we had $568,412 of acquired product and    licensing rights included in other assets on our balance sheet.    Declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed    products may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of    the related assets and could result in an impairment charge.    Reduction in our net earnings caused by impairment charges could    harm our financial results. We may    not realize the anticipated benefits of future acquisitions or    those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their    realization.     Acquisitions have been a significant part of our historical    growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our    product offerings. In making acquisitions, we target companies    that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products    or the ability for us to leverage our entertainment offerings.    However, we cannot be certain that the products of companies we    may acquire, or acquire an interest in, in the future will    achieve or maintain popularity with consumers or that any such    acquired companies will allow us to more effectively market our    products. In some cases, we expect that the integration of the    companies that we acquire into our operations will create    production, marketing and other operating synergies which will    produce greater revenue growth and profitability and, where    applicable, cost savings, operating efficiencies and other    advantages. However, we cannot be certain that these synergies,    efficiencies and cost savings will be realized. Even if    achieved, these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their    realization. In other cases, we acquire companies that we    believe have strong and creative management, in which case we    plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully    integrating them into our operations. We cannot be certain that    the key talented individuals at these companies will continue to    work for us after the acquisition or that they will develop    popular and profitable products or services in the future.    16Table of ContentsFrom    time to time, we are involved in litigation, arbitration or    regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which    could entail significant expense.     As is the case with many large multinational corporations, we    are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations,    litigation and arbitration disputes. Because the outcome of    litigation, arbitration and regulatory investigations is    inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome    of any of these matters could entail significant expense for us    and harm our business. The fact that we operate in significant    numbers of international markets also increases the risk that we    may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply    with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements. We    have a material amount of goodwill which, if it becomes    impaired, would result in a reduction in our net    earnings.     Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition    exceeds the fair value of the net assets we acquire. Current    accounting standards require that goodwill no longer be    amortized but instead be periodically evaluated for impairment    based on the fair value of the reporting unit. At    December 28, 2008, approximately $474,497 or 15.0%, of our    total assets represented goodwill. Declines in our profitability    may impact the fair value of our reporting units, which could    result in a write-down of our goodwill. Reductions in our net    earnings caused by the write-down of goodwill could harm our    results of operations. "

 That May Affect Future    Results     From time to time, including in this Annual Report on    Form 10-K    and in our annual report to shareholders, we publish    forward-looking statements within the meaning of the    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These    forward-looking statements may relate to such    matters as our anticipated financial performance or business    prospects in future periods, expected technological and product    developments, the expected timing of new product introductions    or our expectations concerning the future acceptance of products    by customers, the timing of entertainment releases, marketing    and promotional efforts, research and development activities,    liquidity, and similar matters. Forward-looking statements are    inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. The Private    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor    for forward-looking statements. These statements may be    identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such    as anticipate, believe,    could, expect, intend,    looking forward, may,    planned, potential, should,    will and would or any variations of    words with similar meanings. We note that a variety of factors    could cause our actual results and experience to differ    materially from the anticipated results or other expectations    expressed or anticipated in our forward-looking statements. The    factors listed below are illustrative and other risks and    uncertainties may arise as are or may be detailed from time to    time in our public announcements and our filings with the    Securities and Exchange Commission, such as on    Forms 8-K,10-Q and    10-K. We    undertake no obligation to make any revisions to the    forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on    Form 10-K    or in our annual report to shareholders to reflect events or    circumstances occurring after the date of the filing of this    report. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all dollar or    share amounts herein are expressed in thousands of dollars or    shares, except for per share amounts.    7Table of ContentsThe    volatility of consumer preferences, combined with the high level    of competition and low barriers to entry in the family    entertainment industry make it difficult to maintain the success    of existing products and product lines or consistently introduce    successful new products. In addition, an inability to develop    and introduce planned new products and product lines in a timely    and cost-effective manner may damage our business.     The family entertainment business is a fashion industry. Our    success is critically dependent upon the consumer appeal of our    products, principally games and toys. Our failure to    successfully anticipate, identify and react to childrens    interests and the current preferences in family entertainment    could significantly lower sales of our products and harm our    sales and profitability.     A decline in the popularity of our existing products and product    lines, or the failure of our new products and product lines to    achieve and sustain market acceptance with retailers and    consumers, could significantly lower our sales and operating    margins, which would in turn harm our profitability, business    and financial condition. In our industry, it is important to    identify and offer what are considered to be the hot    toys and games on childrens wish lists. Our    continued success will depend on our ability to develop, market    and sell popular toys, games and childrens electronic    products which are sought after by both children and their    parents. We seek to achieve and maintain market popularity for    our products through the redesign and extension of our existing    family entertainment properties in ways we believe will capture    evolving consumer interest and imagination and remain relevant    in todays world, and by developing, introducing and    gaining customer interest for new family entertainment products.    This process involves anticipating and extending successful play    patterns and identifying entertainment concepts and properties    that appeal to childrens imaginations. However, consumer    preferences with respect to family entertainment are    continuously changing and are difficult to anticipate. Evolving    consumer tastes, coupled with an ever changing pipeline of    entertainment properties and products which compete for consumer    interest and acceptance, creates an environment in which    products can be extremely popular during a certain period in    time but then rapidly be replaced in consumers minds with    other properties. As a result, individual family entertainment    products and properties generally, and high technology products    in particular, often have short consumer life cycles.     Not only must we address rapidly changing consumer tastes and    interests but we face competitors who are also constantly    monitoring consumer tastes, seeking ideas which will appeal to    consumers and introducing new products that compete with our    products for consumer purchasing. In addition to existing    competitors, the barriers to entry for new participants in the    family entertainment industry are low. New participants with a    popular product idea or property can gain access to consumers    and become a significant source of competition for our products.    In some cases our competitors products may achieve greater    market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce    demand for our products.     The challenge of developing and offering products that are    sought after by children is compounded by the trend of children    getting older younger. By this we mean that children    are losing interest in traditional toys and games at younger    ages and, as a result, at younger and younger ages, our products    compete with the offerings of video game suppliers, consumer    electronics companies and other businesses outside of the    traditional toy and game industry.     In addition to designing and developing products based on our    own brands, we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and    interests by producing products based on popular entertainment    properties developed by other parties and licensed to us. The    success of entertainment properties released theatrically for    which we have a license, such as MARVEL or STAR WARS related    products, can significantly affect our revenues and    profitability. If we produce a line of products based on a movie    or television series, the success of the movie or series has a    critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the    associated products we are offering. In addition, competition in    our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen    our ability to secure, maintain, and renew popular licenses to    entertainment products on beneficial terms, if at all, and to    attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design,    develop and market successful products based on these    properties. The loss of rights granted pursuant to any of our    licensing agreements could harm our business and competitive    position.    8Table of Contents    There is no guarantee that:           Any of our current products or product lines will continue to be    popular;           Any property for which we have a significant license will    achieve or sustain popularity;           Any new products or product lines we introduce will be    considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate    market acceptance;           Any new products life cycle will be sufficient to permit    us to profitably recover development, manufacturing, marketing,    royalties (including royalty advances and guarantees) and other    costs of producing and selling the product; or           We will be able to manufacture, source and ship new or    continuing products in a timely and cost-effective basis to meet    constantly changing consumer demands, a risk that is heightened    by our customers compressed shipping schedules and the    seasonality of our business.     In developing new products and product lines, we have    anticipated dates for the associated product introductions. When    we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a    particular product or product line at a certain time in the    future those expectations are based on completing the associated    development and implementation work in accordance with our    currently anticipated development schedule. Unforeseen delays or    difficulties in the development process, or significant    increases in the planned cost of development, may cause the    introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or,    in some situations, may cause a product introduction to be    discontinued. Similarly, the success of our products is often    dependent on the timelines and effectiveness of related    advertising and media efforts. Television programming, movie and    DVD releases, comic book releases, and other media efforts are    often critical in generating interest in our products. Not only    our efforts, but the efforts of third parties, heavily impact    the launch dates and success of these media efforts. When we say    that products or brands will be supported by certain media    releases, those statements are based on our current plans and    expectations. Unforeseen factors may delay these media releases    or even lead to their cancellation. Any delay or cancellation of    planned product development work, introductions, or media    support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our    business. Our    business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results    will depend, in large part, on our sales during the relatively    brief holiday shopping season. This seasonality is exacerbated    as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory    levels through quick response inventory management    techniques.     Sales of our family entertainment products at retail are    extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring    during the period from September through December in    anticipation of the holiday season, including Christmas. This    seasonality has increased over time, as retailers become more    efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick    response inventory management techniques. These customers are    timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers,    such as us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. For    toys, games and other family entertainment products which we    produce, a majority of retail sales for the entire year occur in    the fourth quarter, close to the holiday season. As a    consequence, the majority of our sales to our customers occur in    the period from September through December, as our customers do    not want to maintain large on-hand inventories throughout the    year ahead of consumer demand. While these techniques reduce a    retailers investment in inventory, they increase pressure    on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a    significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the    supplier.     The limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or    delay retail sales, resulting in lower revenues for us. If we or    our customers determine that one of our products is more popular    at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have    sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to    fully capture consumer interest in the product. Additionally,    the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter    time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve    tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce    our sales and harm our financial performance. This seasonal    pattern requires significant use of working capital, mainly to    manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year    prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting    of demand for products during the holiday season    9Table of Contents    in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or    producing excess inventory of products that are less popular    with consumers. Our failure to accurately predict and respond to    consumer demand, resulting in our underproducing popular items    and/or    overproducing less popular items, would reduce our total sales    and harm our results of operations. In addition, as a result of    the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly    and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the    impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the    year, by unforeseen events, such as a terrorist attack or    economic shock, that harm the retail environment or consumer    buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events,    such as strikes or port delays, that interfere with the shipment    of goods, particularly from the Far East, during the critical    months leading up to the holiday purchasing season. The    consolidation of our retail customer base means that economic    difficulties or changes in the purchasing policies of our major    customers could have a significant impact on us.     We depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell    the majority of our products. For the fiscal year ended    December 30, 2007, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Target    Corporation, and Toys R Us, Inc., accounted for    approximately 24%, 12% and 11%, respectively, of our    consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers,    including Wal-Mart, Target and Toys R Us, in the    aggregate accounted for approximately 52% of our consolidated    net revenues. In the North American segment, approximately 70%    of the net revenues of the segment were derived from our top    three customers. While the consolidation of our customer base    may provide certain benefits to us, such as potentially more    efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of    sales and distribution, this consolidation also means that if    one or more of our major customers were to experience    difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing    business with us, significantly reduce the amount of their    purchases from us or return substantial amounts of our products,    it could harm our sales, profitability and financial condition.    Increased concentration among our customers could also    negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices    for our products and could result in lower gross margins than    would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation    among our customers. In addition, the bankruptcy or other lack    of success of one or more of our significant retail customers    could negatively impact our revenues and bad debt expense. We may    not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed    material has less market appeal than expected or if sales    revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out    the minimum guaranteed royalties.     An important part of our business involves obtaining licenses to    produce products based on various entertainment properties and    theatrical releases, such as those based upon MARVEL or STAR    WARS characters. The license agreements we enter to obtain these    rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that    may be substantial, and in some cases may be greater than what    we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales, which could    result in write-offs of significant amounts which in turn would    harm our results of operations. At December 30, 2007, we    had $137,959 of prepaid royalties, $94,616 of which are included    in prepaid expenses and other current assets and $43,343 of    which are included in other assets. Under the terms of existing    contracts as of December 30, 2007, we may be required to    pay future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees    totaling approximately $87,815. Acquiring or renewing licenses    may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we    consider to be too high to be profitable, which may result in    losing licenses we currently hold when they become available for    renewal, or missing business opportunities for new licenses.    Additionally, as a licensee of entertainment based properties we    have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will    translate into successful toy or game products.     We anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie    releases will make it increasingly difficult for us to    profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment    properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for    these products in order to minimize their inventory risk.    Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a successful brand    will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales    in the future, as new entertainment properties and competitive    products are continually being introduced to the market. In the    event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful    entertainment licenses on advantageous terms, our revenues and    profits may be harmed.    10Table of ContentsOur    use of third-party manufacturers to produce the majority of our    toy products, as well as certain other products, presents risks    to our business.     We own and operate two game and puzzle manufacturing facilities,    one in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts and the other in    Waterford, Ireland. However, most of our toy products, in    addition to certain other products, are manufactured by    third-party manufacturers, most of whom are located in the    Peoples Republic of China. Although our external sources    of manufacturing can be shifted, over a period of time, to    alternative sources of supply, should such changes be necessary,    if we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or    components for a material portion of our product line due to    political, labor or other factors beyond our control, our    operations would be disrupted, potentially for a significant    period of time, while alternative sources of supply were    secured. This delay could significantly reduce our sales and    profitability, and harm our business.     Given that the majority of our manufacturing is conducted by    third-party manufacturers located in the Peoples Republic    of China, health conditions and other factors affecting social    and economic activity in China and affecting the movement of    people and products into and from China to our major markets,    including North America and Europe, as well as increases in the    costs of labor and other costs of doing business in China, could    have a significant negative impact on our operations, revenues    and earnings. Factors that could negatively affect our business    include a potential significant revaluation of the Chinese yuan,    which may result in an increase in the cost of producing    products in China, increases in labor costs and difficulties in    moving products manufactured in the Far East out of the Far East    and through the ports on the western coast of    North America, whether due to port congestion, labor    disputes, product regulations and/or inspections or other    factors. Also, the imposition of trade sanctions or other    regulations by the United States or the European Union against    products imported by us from, or the loss of normal trade    relations status with, the Peoples Republic of    China, could significantly increase our cost of products    imported into the United States or Europe and harm our business.    Additionally, the suspension of the operations of a third party    manufacturer by government inspectors in China could result in    delays to us in obtaining product and may harm sales.     We require our third-party manufacturers to comply with our    Global Business Ethics Principles, which are designed to prevent    products manufactured by or for us from being produced under    inhumane or exploitive conditions. The Global Business Ethics    Principles address a number of issues, including working hours    and compensation, health and safety, and abuse and    discrimination. In addition, Hasbro requires that our products    supplied by third-party manufacturers be produced in compliance    with all applicable laws and regulations, including consumer and    product safety laws in the markets where those products are    sold. Hasbro has the right, both directly and through the use of    outside monitors, to monitor compliance by our third-party    manufacturers with our Global Business Ethics Principles and    other manufacturing requirements. In addition, we do quality    assurance testing on our products, including products    manufactured for us by third parties. Notwithstanding these    requirements and our monitoring and testing of compliance with    them, there is always a risk that one or more of our third-party    manufacturers will not comply with our requirements and that we    will not immediately discover such non-compliance. Any failure    of our third-party manufacturers to comply with labor, consumer,    product safety or other applicable requirements in manufacturing    products for us could result in damage to our reputation, harm    sales of our products and potentially create liability for us. Our    substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the    United States subject us to risks associated with international    operations.     We operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries    outside the United States. For the year ended December 30,    2007, our net revenues from international customers comprised    approximately 42% of our total consolidated net revenues. We    expect our sales to international customers to continue to    account for a significant portion of our revenues. Additionally,    as we discussed above, we utilize third-party manufacturers    located principally in the Far East, to produce the majority of    our products, and we have a manufacturing facility in Ireland.    These sales and manufacturing operations are subject to the    risks associated with international operations, including:           Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;           Limitations, including taxes, on the repatriation of earnings;    11Table of Contents           Political instability, civil unrest and economic instability;           Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and    weaker laws protecting such rights;           Complications in complying with different laws in varying    jurisdictions, which laws may dictate that certain practices    which are acceptable in some jurisdictions are not acceptable in    others, and changes in governmental policies;           Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and expense in    recovering therefrom;           Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country    to another, including port congestion, strikes and other    transportation delays and interruptions;           Changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing    business internationally; and           The imposition of tariffs.     Because of the importance of our international sales and    international sourcing of manufacturing to our business, our    financial condition and results of operations could be    significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to    occur. Market    conditions, including commodity and fuel prices, public health    conditions and other third party conduct could negatively impact    our revenues, margins and our other business    initiatives.     Economic and public health conditions, including factors that    impact the strength of the retail market and retail demand, or    our ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely and    cost-effective manner, can have a significant impact on our    business. The success of our family entertainment products is    dependent on consumer purchasing of those products. Consumers    may not purchase our products because the products do not    capture consumer interest and imagination or because competitor    family entertainment offerings are deemed more attractive. But    consumer spending on our products can also be harmed by factors    that negatively impact consumers budgets generally, and    which are not due to our product offerings.     Significant increases in the costs of other products which are    required by consumers, such as gasoline and home heating fuels,    may reduce household spending on discretionary entertainment    products we offer. In addition, weakened economic conditions,    lowered employment levels or recessions in any of our major    markets may significantly reduce purchases of our products.    Economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by terrorist    attacks, wars and other conflicts, increases in critical    commodity prices, or the prospect of such events. Such a    weakened economic and business climate, as well as consumer    uncertainty created by such a climate, could harm our sales and    profitability.     Our success and profitability not only depend on consumer demand    for our products, but also on our ability to produce and sell    those products at costs which allow for profitable sales. Rising    fuel and raw material prices, for components such as resin used    in plastics, increased transportation costs, and increased labor    costs in the markets in which our products are manufactured all    may increase our costs for producing and transporting our    products, which in turn may reduce our margins, reduce our    profitability and harm our business.     Other conditions, such as the unavailability of electrical    components, may impede our ability to manufacture, source and    ship new and continuing products on a timely basis. Additional    factors outside of our control could delay or increase the cost    of implementing our business initiatives and product plans or    alter our actions and reduce actual results. For example, work    stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, a severe public health pandemic    or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts, could    impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product, resulting    in increased costs    and/or lost    sales for our products.    12Table of ContentsPart    of our strategy for remaining relevant to older children is to    offer innovative childrens toy and game electronic    products. The margins on many of these products are lower than    more traditional toys and games and such products may have a    shorter lifespan than more traditional toys and games. As a    result, increasing sales of childrens toy and game    electronic products may lower our overall operating margins and    produce more volatility in our business.     As children have grown older younger and have become    interested in more and more sophisticated and adult products,    such as videogames and consumer electronics, at younger and    younger ages, we have needed to work even harder to keep our    products relevant for these consumers. One initiative we have    been pursuing to capture the interest of older children is to    offer innovative childrens electronic toys and games.    Examples of such products in the last few years include    VIDEONOW, CHATNOW, ZOOMBOX, our I-branded products such as I-DOG    and I-CAT, and our FURREAL FRIENDS line of products, including    BUTTERSCOTCH. These products, if successful, can be an effective    way for us to connect with consumers and increase sales.    However, childrens electronics, in addition to the risks    associated with our other family entertainment products, also    face certain additional risks.     Our costs for designing, developing and producing electronic    products tend to be higher than for many of our other more    traditional products, such as board games and action figures.    The ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient    sales quantities and to reflect higher costs in higher prices is    constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics. As a    consequence, our margins on the sales of electronic products    tend to be lower than for more traditional products and we can    face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover    our costs. In addition, the pace of change in product offerings    and consumer tastes in the electronics area is potentially even    greater than for our other products. This pace of change means    that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain    consumer interest may be even shorter. As a    manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational    corporation, we are subject to various government regulations    and may be subject to additional regulations in the future,    violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise    harm our business. In addition, we could be the subject of    future product liability suits or product recalls, which could    harm our business.     As a manufacturer of consumer products, we are subject to    significant government regulations, including, in the United    States, under The Consumer Products Safety Act, The Federal    Hazardous Substances Act, and The Flammable Fabrics Act, as well    as under product safety and consumer protection statutes in our    international markets. In addition, certain of our products are    subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration or    similar international authorities. While we take all the steps    we believe are necessary to comply with these acts, there can be    no assurance that we will be in compliance in the future.    Failure to comply could result in sanctions which could have a    negative impact on our business, financial condition and results    of operations. We may also be subject to involuntary product    recalls or may voluntarily conduct a product recall. While costs    associated with product recalls have generally not been material    to our business, the costs associated with future product    recalls individually and in the aggregate in any given fiscal    year, could be significant. In addition, any product recall,    regardless of direct costs of the recall, may harm consumer    perceptions of our products and have a negative impact on our    future sales and results of operations.     Governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we    manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations    relating to product safety and consumer protection in the    future, and may also increase the penalties for failure to    comply with product safety and consumer protection regulations.    In addition, one or more of our customers might require changes    in our products, such as the non-use of certain materials, in    the future. Complying with any such additional regulations or    requirements could impose increased costs on our business.    Similarly, increased penalties for non-compliance could subject    us to greater expense in the event any of our products were    found to not comply with such regulations. Such increased costs    or penalties could harm our business.     In addition to government regulation, products that have been or    may be developed by us may expose us to potential liability from    personal injury or property damage claims by the users of such    products. There can    13Table of Contents    be no assurance that a claim will not be brought against us in    the future. Any successful claim could significantly harm our    business, financial condition and results of operations.     As a large, multinational corporation, we are subject to a host    of governmental regulations throughout the world, including    antitrust, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott    regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Our failure    to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could    subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that    could harm our business and financial condition. Our    business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may    not be able to protect such rights successfully. In addition, we    have a material amount of acquired product rights which, if    impaired, would result in a reduction of our    income.     Our intellectual property, including our license agreements and    other agreements that establish our ownership rights and    maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, are    of great value. We rely on a combination of trade secret,    copyright, trademark, patent and other proprietary rights laws    to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related    to our brands. From time to time, third parties have challenged,    and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our    intellectual property. In addition, our business is subject to    the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or    infringing on our intellectual property rights. We may need to    resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property    rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of    resources. Our failure to protect our intellectual property    rights could harm our business and competitive position. Much of    our intellectual property has been internally developed and has    no carrying value on our balance sheet. As of December 30,    2007, we had approximately $486,232 of acquired product and    licensing rights included in other assets on our balance sheet.    Declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed    products may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of    the related assets and could result in an impairment charge.    Reduction in our net income caused by impairment charges could    harm our financial results. We may    not realize the anticipated benefits of future acquisitions or    those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their    realization.     Although we have not made any major acquisitions in the last few    years, acquisitions have been a significant part of our    historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and    diversify our product offerings. In making acquisitions, we    target companies that we believe offer attractive family    entertainment products. However, we cannot be certain that the    products of companies we may acquire in the future will achieve    or maintain popularity with consumers. In some cases, we expect    that the integration of the product lines of the companies that    we acquire into our operations will create production, marketing    and other operating synergies which will produce greater revenue    growth and profitability and, where applicable, cost savings,    operating efficiencies and other advantages. However, we cannot    be certain that these synergies, efficiencies and cost savings    will be realized. Even if achieved, these benefits may be    delayed or reduced in their realization. In other cases, we    acquire companies that we believe have strong and creative    management, in which case we plan to operate them more    autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our    operations. We cannot be certain that the key talented    individuals at these companies will continue to work for us    after the acquisition or that they will continue to develop    popular and profitable products or services. From    time to time, we are involved in litigation, arbitration or    regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which    could entail significant expense.     As is the case with many large multinational corporations, we    are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations,    litigation and arbitration disputes. Because the outcome of    litigation, arbitration and regulatory investigations is    inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome    of any of these matters could entail significant expense for us    and harm our business. The fact that we operate in significant    numbers of international markets also increases the risk that we    may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply    with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements.    14Table of ContentsWe    rely on external financing, including our credit facilities and    accounts receivable securitization facility, to help fund our    operations. If we were unable to obtain or service such    financing, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were    too burdensome, our business would be harmed.     Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our    working capital needs, particularly those in the third and    fourth quarters, we rely on our revolving credit facility and    our other credit facilities for working capital. We currently    have a five-year revolving credit agreement, which provides for    a $300,000 committed revolving credit facility which provides    the Company the ability to request increases in the committed    facility in additional increments of $50,000, up to a total of    $500,000. The credit agreement contains certain restrictive    covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and    certain other limitations typical of an investment grade    facility. These restrictive covenants may limit our future    actions, and financial, operating and strategic flexibility. In    addition, our financial covenants were set at the time we    entered into our credit facility. Our performance and financial    condition may not meet our original expectations, causing us to    fail to meet such financial covenants. Non-compliance with our    debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize    borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank    lines, a circumstance which potentially could occur when    operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings    to enable us to continue to fund our operations.     As an additional source of working capital and liquidity, we    currently have a $250,000 accounts receivable securitization    program, which is increased to $300,000 for the period from    fiscal October through fiscal January. Under this program, we    sell on an ongoing basis, substantially all of our domestic    U.S. dollar denominated trade accounts receivable to a    bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. Under this facility,    the special purpose entity is able to sell, on a revolving    basis, undivided ownership interests in the eligible receivables    to bank conduits. During the term of the facility, we must    maintain certain performance ratios. If we fail to maintain    these ratios, we could be prevented from accessing this    cost-effective source of working capital and short-term    financing.     We believe that our cash flow from operations, together with our    cash on hand and access to existing credit facilities and our    accounts receivable securitization facility, are adequate for    current and planned needs in 2008. However, our actual    experience may differ from these expectations. Factors that may    lead to a difference include, but are not limited to, the    matters discussed herein, as well as future events that might    have the effect of reducing our available cash balance, such as    unexpected material operating losses or increased capital or    other expenditures, as well as increases in inventory or    accounts receivable that are ineligible for sale under our    securitization facility, or future events that may reduce or    eliminate the availability of external financial resources.     We also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to    time, through the issuance of debt securities. Our ability to    issue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will    depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any    ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interest    rates, and the overall condition of the financial and credit    markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit    markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the    past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Variations in    these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt    securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order    to sell new debt securities. The failure to receive financing on    desirable terms, or at all, could damage our ability to support    our future operations or capital needs or engage in other    business activities.     As of December 30, 2007, we had $844,815 of total principal    amount of indebtedness outstanding, of which $135,092 is due in    July 2008. If we are unable to generate sufficient available    cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to    refinance such debt or face default. There is no guarantee that    we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms, or at    all. This total indebtedness includes $249,828 in aggregate    principal amount of 2.75% senior convertible debentures    that we issued in 2001. On December 1, 2011 and    December 1, 2016, and upon the occurrence of certain    fundamental corporate changes, holders of the 2.75% senior    convertible debentures may require us to purchase their    debentures. At that time, the purchase price may be paid in    cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the two, at our    discretion, provided    15Table of Contents    that we will pay accrued and unpaid interest in cash. We may not    have sufficient cash at that time to make the required    repurchases and may be required to settle in shares of common    stock. We    have a material amount of goodwill which, if it becomes    impaired, would result in a reduction in our net    income.     Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition    accounted for using the purchase method exceeds the fair value    of the net assets we acquire. Current accounting standards    require that goodwill no longer be amortized but instead be    periodically evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of    the reporting unit. At December 30, 2007, approximately    $471,177 or 14.6%, of our total assets represented goodwill.    Declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our    reporting units, which could result in a write-down of our    goodwill. Reductions in our net income caused by the write-down    of goodwill could harm our results of operations. "

Forward-looking statements are inherently    subject to risks and uncertainties. The Private Securities    Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for    forward-looking statements. These statements may be identified    by the use of forward-looking words or phrases such as    anticipate, believe, could,    expect, intend, looking    forward, may, planned,    potential, should, will and    would or any variations of words with similar    meanings. We note that a variety of factors could cause our    actual results and experience to differ materially from the    anticipated results or other expectations expressed or    anticipated in our forward-looking statements. The factors    listed below are illustrative and other risks and uncertainties    may arise as are or may be detailed from time to time in our    public announcements and our filings with the Securities and    Exchange Commission, such as on    Forms 8-K,10-Q and    10-K. We    undertake no obligation to make any revisions to the    forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on    Form 10-K    or in our annual report to shareholders to reflect events or    circumstances occurring after the date of the filing of this    report. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all dollar or    share amounts herein are expressed in thousands of dollars or    shares, except for per share amounts. Volatility    of consumer preferences, combined with the high level of    competition and low barriers to entry in the family    entertainment industry make it difficult to maintain the success    of existing product lines or consistently introduce successful    new products. In addition, an inability to develop and introduce    planned new products and product lines in a timely and    cost-effective manner may damage our business.     The family entertainment business is a fashion industry. Our    success is critically dependent upon the consumer appeal of our    products, principally games and toys. Our failure to    successfully anticipate, identify and react to childrens    interests and the current preferences in family entertainment    could significantly lower sales of our products and harm our    profitability.     A decline in the popularity of our existing products and product    lines, or the failure of our new products and product lines to    achieve and sustain market acceptance with retailers and    consumers, could significantly lower our sales and operating    margins, which would in turn harm our profitability, business    and financial condition. In our industry, it is important to    identify and offer what are considered to be the hot    toys and games on childrens wish lists. Our    continued success will depend on our ability to develop, market    and sell popular toys, games and childrens electronic    products which are sought after by both children and their    parents. We seek to achieve and maintain market popularity for    our products through the redesign and extension of our existing    family entertainment properties in ways we believe will capture    evolving consumer interest and imagination and remain relevant    in todays world, and by developing, introducing and    gaining customer interest for new family entertainment products.    This process involves anticipating and extending successful play    patterns and identifying entertainment concepts and properties    that appeal to childrens imaginations. However, consumer    preferences with respect to family entertainment are    continuously changing and are difficult to anticipate. Evolving    consumer tastes, coupled with an ever changing pipeline of    entertainment properties and products which compete for consumer    interest and acceptance, creates an environment in which    products can be extremely popular during a certain period in    time but then rapidly be replaced in consumers minds with    other properties. As a result, individual family entertainment    products and properties generally, and high technology products    in particular, often have short consumer life cycles.     Not only must we address rapidly changing consumer tastes and    interests but we face competitors who are also constantly    monitoring consumer tastes, seeking ideas which will appeal to    consumers and introducing new products that compete with our    products for consumer purchasing. In addition to existing    competitors, the barriers to entry for new participants in the    family entertainment industry are low. New participants with a    popular product idea or property can gain access to consumers    and become a significant source of competition for our products.    In some cases our competitors products may achieve greater    market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce    demand for our products.     The challenge of developing and offering products that are    sought after by children is compounded by the trend of children    getting older younger. By this we mean that children    are losing interest in traditional toys at younger ages and, as    a result, at younger and younger ages, our products compete with    the offerings of    8Table of Contents    video game suppliers, consumer electronics companies and other    businesses outside of the traditional toy and game industry.     In addition to designing and developing products based on our    own brands, we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and    interests by producing products based on popular entertainment    properties developed by other parties and licensed to us. The    success of entertainment properties released theatrically for    which we have a license, such as MARVEL or STAR WARS related    products, can significantly affect our revenues. If we produce a    line of products based on a movie or television series, the    success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the    level of consumer interest in the associated products we are    offering. In addition, competition in our industry for access to    entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure,    maintain, and renew popular licenses to entertainment products    on beneficial terms, if at all, and to attract and retain the    talented employees necessary to design, develop and market    successful products based on these properties. The loss of    ownership rights granted pursuant to any of our licensing    agreements could harm our business and competitive position.     There is no guarantee that:           Any of our current products or product lines will continue to be    popular;           Any property for which we have a significant license will    achieve or sustain popularity;           Any new products or product lines we introduce will be    considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate    market acceptance;           Any new products life cycle will be sufficient to permit    us to profitably recover development, manufacturing, marketing,    royalties (including royalty advances and guarantees) and other    costs of producing and selling the product; or           We will be able to manufacture, source and ship new or    continuing products in a timely and cost-effective basis to meet    constantly changing consumer demands, a risk that is heightened    by our customers compressed shipping schedules and the    seasonality of our business.     In developing new products and product lines, we have    anticipated dates for the associated product introductions. When    we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a    particular product or product line at a certain time in the    future those expectations are based on completing the associated    development and implementation work in accordance with our    currently anticipated development schedule. Unforeseen delays or    difficulties in the development process, or significant    increases in the planned cost of development, may cause the    introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or,    in some situations, may cause a product introduction to be    discontinued. Similarly, the success of our products is often    dependent on the timelines and effectiveness of related    advertising and media efforts. Television programming, movie and    DVD releases, comic book releases, and other media efforts are    often critical in generating interest in our products. Not only    our efforts, but the efforts of third parties, heavily impact    the launch dates and success of these media efforts. When we say    that products or brands will be supported by certain media    releases, those statements are based on our current plans and    expectations. Unforeseen factors may delay these media releases    or even lead to their cancellation. Any delay or cancellation of    planned product development work, introductions, or media    support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our    business. Our    business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results    will depend, in large part, on our sales during the relatively    brief holiday season. This seasonality is exacerbated as    retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory    levels through quick response inventory management    techniques.     Sales of our family entertainment products at retail are    extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring    during the period from September through December in    anticipation of the holiday season, including Christmas. This    seasonality has increased over time, as retailers become more    efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick    response inventory management techniques. These customers are    timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers,    such as us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. For    toys, games and other family entertainment products which we    produce, a majority of retail sales occur in the    9Table of Contents    fourth quarter, close to the holiday season. As a consequence,    the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period    from September through December, as our customers do not want to    maintain large on-hand inventories throughout the year to meet    consumer demand. While these techniques reduce a retailers    investment in inventory, they increase pressure on suppliers    like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant    portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier.     The limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or    delay retail sales, resulting in lower revenues for us. If we or    our customers determine that one of our products is more popular    at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have    sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to    fully capture consumer interest in the product. Additionally,    the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter    time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve    tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce    our sales and harm our financial performance. This seasonal    pattern requires significant use of working capital, mainly to    manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year    prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting    of demand for products during the holiday season in order to    avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing    excess inventory of products that are less popular with    consumers. Our failure to accurately predict and respond to    consumer demand, resulting in our underproducing popular items    and/or    overproducing less popular items, would reduce our total sales    and harm our results of operations. In addition, as a result of    the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly    and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the    impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the    year, by unforeseen events, such as a terrorist attack or    economic shock, that harm the retail environment or consumer    buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events,    such as strikes or port delays, that interfere with the shipment    of goods, particularly from the Far East, during the critical    months leading up to the holiday purchasing season. The    continuing consolidation of our retail customer base means that    economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing policies of    our major customers could have a significant impact on    us.     We depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell    the majority of our products. For the fiscal year ended    December 31, 2006, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Target    Corporation, and Toys R Us, Inc., accounted for    approximately 24%, 13% and 11%, respectively, of our    consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers,    including Wal-Mart, Target and Toys R Us, in the aggregate    accounted for approximately 53% of our consolidated net    revenues. These net revenues were primarily related to the North    American segment. While the consolidation of our customer base    may provide certain benefits to us, such as potentially more    efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of    sales and distribution, this consolidation also means that if    one or more of our major customers were to experience    difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us, cease doing    business with us, significantly reduce the amount of their    purchases from us or return substantial amounts of our products,    it could harm our business, financial condition and results of    operations. Increased concentration among our customers could    also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales    prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins    than would otherwise be obtained if there were less    consolidation among our customers. In addition, the bankruptcy    or other lack of success of one or more of our significant    retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and bad    debt expense. We may    not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed    material has less market appeal than expected or if sales    revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out    the minimum guaranteed royalties.     An important part of our business involves obtaining licenses to    produce products based on various entertainment properties and    theatrical releases, such as those based upon MARVEL or STAR    WARS characters. The license agreements we enter to obtain these    rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that    may be substantial, and in some cases may be greater than what    we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales, which could    result in write-offs of significant amounts which in turn would    harm our results of operations. At December 31, 2006, we    had $181,561 of prepaid royalties, $116,792 of which are    included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and    $64,769 of which are included in other assets. Under the terms    of existing contracts as of December 31, 2006, we may be    required to pay future minimum    10Table of Contents    guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling    approximately $164,780. Acquiring or renewing licenses may    require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we    consider to be too high to be profitable, which may result in    losing licenses we currently hold when they become available for    renewal, or missing business opportunities for new licenses.    Additionally, as a licensee of entertainment based properties we    have no guaranty that a particular property or brand will    translate into successful toy or game products.     We anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie    releases will make it increasingly difficult for us to    profitably sell licensed products based on entertainment    properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for    these products in order to minimize their inventory risk.    Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a successful brand    will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales    in the future, as new entertainment properties and competitive    products are continually being introduced to the market. In the    event that we are not able to acquire or maintain successful    entertainment licenses on advantageous terms, our revenues and    profits may be harmed. Our    substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the    United States subject us to risks associated with international    operations.     We operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries    outside the United States. For the year ended December 31,    2006, our net revenues from international customers comprised    approximately 40% of our total consolidated net revenues. We    expect our sales to international customers to continue to    account for a significant portion of our revenues. Additionally,    we utilize third-party manufacturers located principally in the    Far East, to produce the majority of our products, and we have a    manufacturing facility in Ireland. These sales and manufacturing    operations are subject to the risks associated with    international operations, including:           Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;           Limitations, including taxes, on the repatriation of earnings;           Political instability, civil unrest and economic instability;           Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and    weaker laws protecting such rights;           Complications in complying with different laws in varying    jurisdictions, which laws may dictate that certain practices    which are acceptable in some jurisdictions are not acceptable in    others, and changes in governmental policies;           Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and expense in    recovering therefrom;           Difficulties in moving materials and products from one country    to another, including port congestion, strikes and other    transportation delays and interruptions;           Changes in international labor costs and other costs of doing    business internationally; and           The imposition of tariffs.     Our reliance on external sources of manufacturing can be    shifted, over a period of time, to alternative sources of    supply, should such changes be necessary. However, if we were    prevented from obtaining products or components for a material    portion of our product line due to political, labor or other    factors beyond our control, our operations would be disrupted,    potentially for a significant period of time, while alternative    sources of products were secured. In particular, as the majority    of our toy products, in addition to certain other products, are    manufactured in the Peoples Republic of China, health    conditions and other factors affecting social and economic    activity in China and affecting the movement of people and    products into and from China to our major markets, including    North America and Europe, and the labor and other costs of doing    business in China, could have a significant negative impact on    our operations, revenues and earnings. Factors that could    negatively affect our business include a potential revaluation    of the Chinese yuan, which may result in an increase in the cost    of producing products in China, increases in labor costs and    difficulties in moving products manufactured in the Far East    through the ports on the western coast of North America, whether    due to port congestion, labor disputes or other factors. Also,    the imposition of trade sanctions by the United States or the    European Union against a class of products imported by us from,    or the loss of normal trade relations status    11Table of Contents    with, the Peoples Republic of China, could significantly    increase our cost of products imported into the United States or    Europe and harm our business. Because of the importance of our    international sales and international sourcing of manufacturing    to our business, our financial condition and results of    operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks    described above were to occur. Part    of our strategy for remaining relevant to older children is to    offer innovative childrens toy and game electronic    products. The margins on many of these products are lower than    more traditional toys and games and such products may have a    shorter lifespan than more traditional toys and games. As a    result, increasing sales of childrens toy and game    electronic products may lower our overall operating margins and    produce more volatility in our business.     As children have grown older younger and have become    interested in more and more sophisticated and adult products,    such as videogames and consumer electronics, at younger and    younger ages, we have needed to work even harder to keep our    products relevant for these consumers. One initiative we have    been pursuing to capture the interest of older children is to    offer innovative childrens electronic toys and games.    Examples of such products in the last few years include    VIDEONOW, CHATNOW, ZOOMBOX, our I-branded products such as I-DOG    and I-CAT, and our FURREAL FRIENDS line of products, including    BUTTERSCOTCH. These products, if successful, can be an effective    way for us to connect with consumers and increase sales.    However, childrens electronics, in addition to the risks    associated with our other family entertainment products, also    face certain additional risks.     Our costs for designing, developing and producing electronic    products tend to be higher than for many of our other more    traditional products, such as board games and action figures.    The ability to recoup these higher costs through sufficient    sales quantities and to reflect higher costs in higher prices is    constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics. As a    consequence, our margins on the sales of electronic products    tend to be lower than for more traditional products and we can    face increased risk of not achieving sales sufficient to recover    our costs. In addition, the pace of change in product offerings    and consumer tastes in the electronics area is potentially even    greater than for our other products. This pace of change means    that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain    consumer interest may be even shorter. Market    conditions, including commodity and fuel prices, public health    conditions and other third party conduct could negatively impact    our revenues, margins and our other business    initiatives.     Economic and public health conditions, including factors that    impact the strength of the retail market and retail demand, or    our ability to manufacture and deliver products, can have a    significant impact on our business. The success of our family    entertainment products is dependent on consumer purchasing of    those products. Consumers may not purchase our products because    the products do not capture consumer interest and imagination or    because competitor family entertainment offerings are deemed    more attractive. But consumer spending on our products can also    be harmed by factors that negatively impact consumers    budgets generally, and which are not due to our product    offerings. Significant increases in the costs of other products    which are required by consumers, such as gasoline and home    heating fuels, may reduce household spending on entertainment    products we offer. In addition, rising fuel and raw material    prices, for components such as resin used in plastics, or    increased transportation costs, may increase our costs for    producing and transporting our products, which in turn may    reduce our margins and harm our business.     In addition, general economic conditions and employment levels    can impact demand for our products. Economic conditions were    significantly harmed by the September 11, 2001 terrorist    attacks and could be similarly affected by any future attacks.    Economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by wars and    other conflicts, increases in critical commodity prices, or the    prospect of such events. Such a weakened economic and business    climate, as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a    climate, could harm our sales and profitability.     Other conditions, such as the unavailability of electrical    components, may impede our ability to manufacture, source and    ship new and continuing products on a timely basis. Additional    factors outside of our control could delay or increase the cost    of implementing our business initiatives and product plans or    alter our    12Table of Contents    actions and reduce actual results. For example, work stoppages,    slowdowns or strikes, a severe public health pandemic or the    occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts, could impact    our ability to manufacture or deliver product, resulting in    increased costs    and/or lost    sales for our products. Our    business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may    not be able to protect such rights successfully. In addition, we    have a material amount of acquired product rights which, if    impaired, would result in a reduction of our    income.     Our intellectual property, including our license agreements and    other agreements that establish our ownership rights and    maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, are    of great value. We rely on a combination of trade secret,    copyright, trademark, patent and other proprietary rights laws    to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related    to our brands. From time to time, third parties have challenged,    and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our    intellectual property. In addition, our business is subject to    the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or    infringing on our intellectual property rights. We may need to    resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property    rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of    resources. Our failure to protect our intellectual property    rights could harm our business and competitive position. Much of    our intellectual property has been internally developed and has    no carrying value on our balance sheet. However, as of    December 31, 2006, we had approximately $532,257 of    acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets    on our balance sheet. Declines in the profitability of the    acquired brands or licensed products may impact our ability to    recover the carrying value of the related assets and could    result in an impairment charge. Reduction in our net income    caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results. We may    not realize the anticipated benefits of future acquisitions or    those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their    realization.     Although we have not made any major acquisitions in the last few    years, acquisitions have been a significant part of our    historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and    diversify our product offerings. In making acquisitions, we    target companies that we believe offer attractive family    entertainment products. We may also target companies in markets    where we would like to increase our local presence. However, we    cannot be certain that the products of companies we may acquire    in the future will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers    or that we will be successful in a particular geographic region.    In some cases, we expect that the integration of the product    lines of the companies that we acquire into our operations will    create production, marketing and other operating synergies which    will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and, where    applicable, cost savings, operating efficiencies and other    advantages. However, we cannot be certain that these synergies,    efficiencies and cost savings will be realized. Even if    achieved, these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their    realization. In other cases, we acquire companies that we    believe have strong and creative management, in which case we    plan to operate them more autonomously rather than fully    integrating them into our operations. We cannot be certain that    the key talented individuals at these companies will continue to    work for us after the acquisition or that they will continue to    develop popular and profitable products or services. From    time to time, we are involved in litigation, arbitration or    regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which    could entail significant expense.     As is the case with many large multinational corporations, we    are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations,    litigation and arbitration disputes. Because the outcome of    litigation, arbitration and regulatory investigations is    inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome    of any of these matters could entail significant expense for us    and harm our business. The fact that we operate in significant    numbers of international markets also increases the risk that we    may face legal and regulatory exposures as we attempt to comply    with a large number of varying legal and regulatory requirements.    13Table of Contents We    rely on external financing, including our credit facilities and    accounts receivable securitization facility, to fund our    operations. If we were unable to obtain or service such    financing, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were    too burdensome, our business would be harmed.     Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our    working capital needs, particularly those in the third and    fourth quarters, we rely on our revolving credit facility and    our other credit facilities for working capital. We currently    have a five-year revolving credit agreement, which provides for    a $300,000 committed revolving credit facility which provides    the Company the ability to request increases in the committed    facility in additional increments of $50,000, up to a total of    $500,000. The credit agreement contains certain restrictive    covenants setting forth leverage and coverage requirements, and    certain other limitations typical of an investment grade    facility. These restrictive covenants may limit our future    actions, and financial, operating and strategic flexibility. In    addition, our financial covenants were set at the time we    entered into our credit facility. Our performance and financial    condition may not meet our original expectations, causing us to    fail to meet such financial covenants. Non-compliance with our    debt covenants could result in us being unable to utilize    borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other bank    lines, a circumstance which potentially could occur when    operating shortfalls would most require supplementary borrowings    to enable us to continue to fund our operations.     As an additional source of working capital and liquidity, we    currently have a $250,000 accounts receivable securitization    program, which is increased to $300,000 from fiscal October    through fiscal January. Under this program, we sell on an    ongoing basis, substantially all of our U.S. dollar    denominated trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote    special purpose entity. Under this facility, the special purpose    entity is able to sell, on a revolving basis, undivided    ownership interests in the eligible receivables to bank    conduits. During the term of the facility, we must maintain    certain performance ratios. If we fail to maintain these ratios,    we could be prevented from accessing this cost-effective source    of working capital and short-term financing.     We believe that our cash flow from operations, together with our    cash on hand and access to existing credit facilities and our    accounts receivable securitization facility, are adequate for    current and planned needs in 2007. However, our actual    experience may differ from these expectations. Factors that may    lead to a difference include, but are not limited to, the    matters discussed herein, as well as future events that might    have the effect of reducing our available cash balance, such as    unexpected material operating losses or increased capital or    other expenditures, as well as increases in inventory or    accounts receivable that are ineligible for sale under our    securitization facility, or future events that may reduce or    eliminate the availability of external financial resources.     We also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to    time, through the issuance of debt securities. Our ability to    issue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will    depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any    ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interest    rates, and the overall condition of the financial and credit    markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit    markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the    past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Variations in    these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt    securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order    to sell new debt securities. The failure to receive financing on    desirable terms, or at all, could damage our ability to support    our future operations or capital needs or engage in other    business activities.     As of December 31, 2006, we had $494,983 of total principal    amount of indebtedness outstanding. If we are unable to generate    sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt    we would need to refinance such debt or face default. There is    no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on    favorable terms, or at all. This total indebtedness includes    $249,996 in aggregate principal amount of 2.75% senior    convertible debentures that we issued in 2001. On    December 1, 2011 and December 1, 2016, and upon the    occurrence of certain fundamental corporate changes, holders of    the 2.75% senior convertible debentures may require us to    purchase their debentures. At that time, the purchase price may    be paid in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the    two, at our discretion, provided that we will pay accrued and    unpaid    14Table of Contents    interest in cash. We may not have sufficient cash at that time    to make the required repurchases and may be required to settle    in shares of common stock.     We previously issued warrants that provide the holder with an    option through January 2008 to sell all of these warrants to us    for a price to be paid, at our election, of either $100,000 in    cash or $110,000 in our common stock, such stock being valued at    the time of the exercise of the option. Should we be required to    settle these warrants under this option, we believe that we will    have adequate funds to settle in cash if necessary. However, we    may not have sufficient funds at that time to make the required    payment and may be required to settle the warrants in stock. As a    manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational    corporation, we are subject to various government regulations,    violation of which could subject us to sanctions. In addition,    we could be the subject of future product liability suits or    product recalls, which could harm our business.     As a manufacturer of consumer products, we are subject to    significant government regulations under The Consumer Products    Safety Act, The Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and The    Flammable Fabrics Act. In addition, certain of our products are    subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration. While    we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with    these acts, there can be no assurance that we will be in    compliance in the future. Failure to comply could result in    sanctions which could have a negative impact on our business,    financial condition and results of operations. We may also be    subject to involuntary product recalls or may voluntarily    conduct a product recall. While costs associated with product    recalls have generally not been material to our business, the    costs associated with future product recalls individually and in    the aggregate in any given fiscal year, could be significant. In    addition, any product recall, regardless of direct costs of the    recall, may harm consumer perceptions of our products and have a    negative impact on our future sales and results of operations.     In addition to government regulation, products that have been or    may be developed by us may expose us to potential liability from    personal injury or property damage claims by the users of such    products. There can be no assurance that a claim will not be    brought against us in the future. While we currently maintain    product liability insurance coverage in amounts we believe    sufficient for our business risks, we may not be able to    maintain such coverage or such coverage may not be adequate to    cover all potential claims. Moreover, even if we maintain    sufficient insurance coverage, any successful claim could    significantly harm our business, financial condition and results    of operations.     As a large, multinational corporation, we are subject to a host    of governmental regulations throughout the world, including    antitrust, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott    regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Our failure    to successfully comply with any such legal requirements could    subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions that    could harm our business and financial condition. We    have a material amount of goodwill which, if it becomes    impaired, would result in a reduction in our net    income.     Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition    accounted for using the purchase method exceeds the fair value    of the net assets we acquire. Current accounting standards    require that goodwill no longer be amortized but instead be    periodically evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of    the reporting unit. At December 31, 2006, approximately    $469,938 or 15.2%, of our total assets represented goodwill.    Declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our    reporting units, which could result in a write-down of our    goodwill. Reductions in our net income caused by the write-down    of goodwill could harm our results of operations. "

In addition, an inability to    develop and introduce planned new products and product lines in    a timely manner may damage our business.     The family entertainment business is a fashion industry. Our    success is critically dependent upon the consumer appeal of our    products, principally games and toys. Our failure to    successfully anticipate, identify and react to childrens    interests and the preferences in family entertainment could    significantly lower sales of our products and harm our    profitability.     A decline in the popularity of our existing products and product    lines, or the failure of our new products and product lines to    achieve and sustain market acceptance, could significantly lower    our sales and operating margins, which would harm our    profitability, business and financial condition. In our    industry, it is important to identify and offer what are    considered to be the hot toys and games on    childrens wish lists. Our continued success will depend on    our ability to develop, market and sell popular toys, games and    childrens electronic products which are sought after by    both children and their parents. We seek to achieve and maintain    market popularity for our products through the redesign and    extension of our existing family entertainment properties in    ways that capture consumer interest and imagination and remain    relevant in todays world, and by developing, introducing    and gaining customer interest for new family entertainment    products. This process involves anticipating and extending    successful play patterns and identifying entertainment concepts    and properties that appeal to childrens imaginations.    However, consumer preferences with respect to family    entertainment are continuously changing and are difficult to    anticipate. Individual family entertainment products and    properties generally, and high technology products in    particular, often have short consumer life cycles.     Not only must we address rapidly changing consumer tastes and    interests but we face competitors who are also constantly    monitoring consumer tastes, seeking ideas which will appeal to    consumers and introducing new products that compete with our    products for consumer purchasing. In addition to existing    competitors, the barriers to entry for new participants in the    family entertainment industry are low. New participants with a    popular product idea or property can gain access to consumers    and become a significant source of competition for our products.     The challenge of developing and offering products that are    sought after by children is compounded by the trend of children    getting older younger. By this we mean that children    are losing interest in traditional toys at younger ages and, as    a result, at younger and younger ages, our products compete with    the offerings of video game suppliers, consumer electronics    companies and other businesses outside of the traditional toy    and game industry.     In addition to designing and developing products based on our    own brands, we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and    interests by producing products based on popular entertainment    properties developed by other parties and licensed to us. The    success of entertainment properties released theatrically for    which we have a license, such as STAR WARS related products, can    significantly affect our revenues. If we produce a line of    products based on a movie or television series, the success of    the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of    consumer interest in the associated products we are offering. In    addition, competition in our industry for access to    entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure,    maintain, and renew popular licenses to entertainment products    on beneficial terms, if at all, and to attract and retain the    talented employees necessary to design, develop and market    successful products based on these properties. The loss of    ownership rights granted pursuant to any of our licensing    agreements could harm our business and competitive position.     There is no guarantee that:     1) Any of our current products or product lines will    continue to be popular;     2) Any property for which we have a significant license    will achieve or sustain popularity;     3) Any new products or product lines we introduce will be    considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate    market acceptance;    9Table of Contents    4) Any new products life cycle will be sufficient to    permit us to profitably recover development, manufacturing,    marketing, royalties (including royalty advances and guarantees)    and other costs of producing and selling the product; or     5) We will be able to manufacture, source and ship new or    continuing products in a timely basis to meet constantly    changing consumer demands, a risk that is heightened by our    customers compressed shipping schedules and the    seasonality of our business.     In developing new products and product lines, we have    anticipated dates for the associated product introductions. When    we state that we will introduce, or anticipate introducing, a    particular product or product line at a certain time in the    future those expectations are based on completing the associated    development and implementation work in accordance with our    currently anticipated development schedule. Unforeseen delays or    difficulties in the development process, or significant    increases in the planned cost of development, may cause the    introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or,    in some situations, may cause a product introduction to be    discontinued. Similarly, the success of our products is often    dependent on the timelines and effectiveness of related    advertising and media efforts. Television programming, movie and    DVD releases, comic book releases, and other media efforts are    often critical in generating interest in our products. Not only    our efforts, but the efforts of third parties, heavily impact    the launch dates and success of these media efforts. When we say    that products or brands will be supported by certain media    releases, those statements are based on our current plans and    expectations. Unforeseen factors may delay these media releases    or even lead to their cancellation. Any delay or cancellation of    planned product development work, introductions, or media    support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our    business. Our    business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results    will depend, in large part, on our sales during the relatively    brief holiday season. Further, this seasonality is increasing,    as large retailers become more efficient in their control of    inventory levels through quick response inventory management    techniques.     Sales of our family entertainment products at retail are    extremely seasonal, with a majority of retail sales occurring    during the period from September through December in    anticipation of the holiday season, including Christmas. This    seasonality is increasing, as large retailers become more    efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick    response inventory management techniques. These customers are    timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers,    such as us, closer to the time of purchase by consumers. For    toys, games and other family entertainment products which we    produce a majority of retail sales occur in the fourth quarter,    close to the holiday season. As a consequence, the majority of    our sales to our customers occur in the period from September    through December, as our customers do not want to maintain large    on-hand inventories throughout the year to meet consumer demand.    While these techniques reduce a retailers investment in    inventory, they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill    orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of    inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier.     The limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or    delay retail sales, resulting in lower revenues for us. If we or    our customers determine that one of our products is more popular    at retail than was originally anticipated, we may not have    sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to    fully capture consumer interest in the product. Additionally,    the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter    time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve    tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce    our sales and harm our financial performance. This seasonal    pattern requires significant use of working capital, mainly to    manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year    prior to the holiday season, and requires accurate forecasting    of demand for products during the holiday season in order to    avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing    excess inventory of products that are less popular with    consumers. Our failure to accurately predict and respond to    consumer demand, resulting in our underproducing popular items    and/or    overproducing less popular items, would reduce our total sales    and harm our results of operations. In addition, as a result of    the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly    and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the    impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the    year, by unforeseen events, such as a terrorist attack or    economic shock, that harm the retail environment or consumer    buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events,    such    10Table of Contents    as strikes or port delays, that interfere with the shipment of    goods, particularly from the Far East, during the months leading    up to the holiday purchasing season. The    continuing consolidation of our retail customer base means that    economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing policies of    our major customers could have a significant impact on    us.     We depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell    the majority of our products. For the fiscal year ended    December 25, 2005, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Toys R Us,    Inc., and Target Corporation accounted for approximately 24%,    12% and 12%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenues and    our five largest customers, including Wal-Mart, Toys R Us    and Target, in the aggregate accounted for approximately 53% of    our consolidated net revenues. While the consolidation of our    customer base may provide certain benefits to us, such as    potentially more efficient product distribution and other    decreased costs of sales and distribution, this consolidation    also means that if one or more of our major customers were to    experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us,    cease doing business with us, significantly reduce the amount of    their purchases from us or return substantial amounts of our    products, it could harm our business, financial condition and    results of operations. Increased concentration among our    customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate    higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower    gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were    less consolidation among our customers. In addition, the    bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our    significant retail customers could negatively impact our    revenues and bad debt expense. We may    not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed    material has less market appeal than expected or if sales    revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out    the minimum guaranteed royalties.     An important part of our business involves obtaining licenses to    produce products based on various theatrical releases, such as    STAR WARS movies. The license agreements we enter to obtain    these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty    guarantees that may be substantial, and in some cases may be    greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual    sales, which could result in write-offs of such amounts that    would harm our results of operations. At December 25, 2005,    we had $126,515 of prepaid royalties, $37,107 of which are    included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and    $89,408 of which are included in other assets. Under the terms    of existing contracts as of December 25, 2005, we are    required to pay future minimum guaranteed royalties and other    licensing fees totaling approximately $66,770. Acquiring or    renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed    royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable,    which may result in losing licenses we currently hold when they    become available for renewal, or missing business opportunities    for new licenses. As a licensee, we have no guaranty that a    particular brand will translate into successful toy or game    products.     In addition to contracts existing as of the end of our 2005    fiscal year, in January 2006, we entered into a license    arrangement with Marvel Entertainment, Inc., and its subsidiary    Marvel Characters, Inc. This license arrangement, which grants    us the right to produce certain products based on Marvels    characters for five years for retail sales beginning in 2007,    requires us to make guaranteed minimum payments in the amount of    up to $205,000. There is no guarantee that we will sell enough    licensed merchandise under the agreement to earn-out the    $205,000 in guaranteed payments and make a profit.     We anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie    releases will make it increasingly difficult for us to sell    licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead    our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order    to minimize inventory risk. Furthermore, there can be no    assurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful    or maintain a high level of sales in the future. In the event    that we are not able to acquire or maintain advantageous    licenses, our revenues and profits may be harmed.    11Table of ContentsOur    substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the    United States subject us to risks associated with international    operations.     We operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries    outside the United States. For the year ended December 25,    2005, our net revenues from international customers comprised    approximately 40% of our total consolidated net revenues. We    expect our sales to international customers to continue to    account for a significant portion of our revenues. Additionally,    we utilize third-party manufacturers located principally in the    Far East and we have a manufacturing facility in Ireland. These    sales and manufacturing operations are subject to the risks    associated with international operations, including:     1) Currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations;     2) Limitations, including taxes, on the repatriation of    earnings;     3) Political instability, civil unrest and economic    instability;     4) Greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property    rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;     5) Complications in complying with laws in varying    jurisdictions and changes in governmental policies;     6) Natural disasters and the greater difficulty and expense    in recovering therefrom;     7) Transportation delays and interruptions; and     8) The imposition of tariffs.     Our reliance on external sources of manufacturing can be    shifted, over a period of time, to alternative sources of    supply, should such changes be necessary. However, if we were    prevented from obtaining products or components for a material    portion of our product line due to political, labor or other    factors beyond our control, our operations would be disrupted    while alternative sources of products were secured. In    particular, as the majority of our toy products, in addition to    certain other products, are manufactured in the Peoples    Republic of China, health conditions and other factors affecting    social and economic activity in China and affecting the movement    of people and products into and from China to our major markets,    including North America and Europe, could have a significant    negative impact on our operations. Factors that could negatively    affect our business include a potential revaluation of the    Chinese yuan, which may result in an increase in the cost of    producing products in China, or increases in labor costs and    difficulties in moving products manufactured in the Far East    through the ports on the western coast of North America. Also,    the imposition of trade sanctions by the United States or the    European Union against a class of products imported by us from,    or the loss of normal trade relations status with,    the Peoples Republic of China, could significantly    increase our cost of products imported into the United States or    Europe and harm our business. Because of the importance of our    international sales and international sourcing of manufacturing    to our business, our financial condition and results of    operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks    described above were to occur. Part    of our strategy for remaining relevant to older children is to    offer innovative childrens toy and game electronic    products. The margins on many of these products are lower than    more traditional toys and games and such products may have a    shorter lifespan than more traditional toys and games. As a    result, increasing sales of childrens toy and game    electronic products may lower our overall operating margins and    produce more volatility in our business.     As children have grown older younger and have become    interested in more and more sophisticated and adult products,    such as videogames and consumer electronics, at younger and    younger ages, we have needed to work even harder to keep our    products relevant for these consumers. One initiative we have    been pursuing to capture the interest of older children is to    offer innovative childrens electronic toys and games.    Examples of such products in the last few years include    VIDEONOW, CHATNOW, MISSION PAINTBALL and I-DOG. These products,    if successful, can be an effective way for us to connect with    tween consumers and increase    12Table of Contents    sales. However, childrens electronics, in addition to the    risks associated with our other family entertainment products,    also face certain additional risks.     Our costs for producing electronic products tend to be higher    than for many of our other more traditional products, such as    board games and action figures. The ability to reflect higher    costs in higher prices is constrained by heavy competition in    consumer electronics. As a consequence, our margins on the sales    of electronic products tend to be lower than for more    traditional products. In addition, the pace of change in product    offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics area is    potentially even greater than for our other products. This pace    of change means that the window in which a product can achieve    and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter. Market    conditions, including commodity and fuel prices, public health    conditions and other third party conduct could negatively impact    our margins and our other business initiatives.     Economic and public health conditions, including factors that    impact the strength of the retail market and retail demand, or    our ability to manufacture and deliver products, can have a    significant impact on our business. The success of our family    entertainment products is dependant on consumer purchasing of    those products. Consumers may not purchase our products because    the products do not capture consumer interest and imagination.    But consumer spending on our products can also be harmed by    factors that negatively impact consumers budgets    generally, and which are not due to our product offerings.    Significant increases in the costs of other products which are    required by consumers, such as gasoline and home heating fuels,    may reduce household spending on entertainment products we    offer. In addition, rising fuel and raw material prices, for    components such as resin, or increased transportation costs, may    increase our costs for producing and transporting our products,    which in turn may reduce our margins and harm our business.     In addition, general economic conditions and employment levels    can impact demand for our products. Economic conditions were    significantly harmed by the September 11, 2001 terrorist    attacks and could be similarly affected by any future attacks.    Economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by wars and    other conflicts, increases in critical commodity prices, or the    prospect of such events. Such a weakened economic and business    climate, as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a    climate, could harm our sales and profitability.     Other conditions, such as the unavailability of electrical    components, may impede our ability to manufacture, source and    ship new and continuing products on a timely basis. Additional    factors outside of our control could delay or increase the cost    of implementing our business initiatives and product plans or    alter our actions and reduce actual results. For example, work    stoppages, slowdowns or strikes, or the occurrence or threat of    wars or other conflicts, could impact our ability to manufacture    or deliver product, resulting in increased costs    and/or lost    sales for our products. Our    business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may    not be able to protect such rights successfully. In addition, we    have a material amount of acquired product rights which, if    impaired, would result in a reduction of our    income.     Our intellectual property, including our license agreements and    other agreements that establish our ownership rights and    maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property, are    of great value. We rely on a combination of trade secret,    copyright, trademark, patent and other proprietary rights laws    to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related    to our brands. From time to time, third parties have challenged,    and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our    intellectual property. In addition, our business is subject to    the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or    infringing on our intellectual property rights. We may need to    resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property    rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of    resources. Our failure to protect our intellectual property    rights could harm our business and competitive position. Much of    our intellectual property has been internally developed and has    no carrying value on our balance sheet. As of December 25,    2005, we had approximately $609,678 of acquired product and    licensing rights included in other assets on our balance sheet.    Declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed    products may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of    the related assets and    13Table of Contents    could result in an impairment charge. Reduction in our net    income caused by impairment charges could harm our financial    results. We may    not realize the anticipated benefits of future acquisitions or    those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their    realization.     Although we have not made any major acquisitions in the last few    years, acquisitions have been a significant part of our    historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and    diversify our product offerings. In making acquisitions, we    target companies that we believe offer attractive family    entertainment products. However, we cannot be certain that the    products of companies we may acquire in the future will achieve    or maintain popularity with consumers. In some cases, we expect    that the integration of the product lines of the companies that    we acquire into our operations will create production, marketing    and other operating synergies which will produce greater revenue    growth and profitability and, where applicable, cost savings,    operating efficiencies and other advantages. However, we cannot    be certain that these synergies, efficiencies and cost savings    will be realized. Even if achieved, these benefits may be    delayed or reduced in their realization. In other cases, we    acquire companies that we believe have strong and creative    management, in which case we plan to operate them autonomously    rather than fully integrating them into our operations. We    cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these    companies will continue to work for us after the acquisition or    that they will continue to develop popular and profitable    products or services. From    time to time, we are involved in litigation, arbitration or    regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which    could entail significant expense.     As is the case with many large multinational corporations, we    are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations,    litigation and arbitration disputes. Because the outcome of    litigation, arbitration and regulatory investigations is    inherently difficult to predict, it is possible that the outcome    of any of these matters could entail significant expense for us    and harm our business. We    rely on external financing, including our credit facilities and    accounts receivable securitization facility, to fund our    operations. If we were unable to obtain or service such    financing, or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were    too burdensome, our business would be harmed.     Due to the seasonal nature of our business, in order to meet our    working capital needs, particularly those in the third and    fourth quarters, we rely on our revolving credit facility and    our other credit facilities for working capital. We currently    have an amended and restated revolving credit agreement, which    provides for a $350,000 revolving credit facility. The credit    agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth    minimum cash flow and coverage requirements, and a number of    other limitations, including restrictions on capital    expenditures, investments, acquisitions, share repurchases,    incurrence of indebtedness and dividend payments. These    restrictive covenants may limit our future actions, and    financial, operating and strategic flexibility. In addition, our    financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our    credit facility. Our performance and financial condition may not    meet our original expectations, causing us to fail to meet such    financial covenants. If we were unable to meet our financial    covenants, or if we failed to comply with other covenants in our    credit facility, we could face significant negative    consequences, including loss of the ability to raise capital    under these facilities to fund our operations.     As an additional source of working capital and liquidity, we    currently have a $250,000 accounts receivable securitization    program. Under this program, we sell on an ongoing basis,    substantially all of our U.S. dollar denominated trade    accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote special purpose    entity. Under this facility, the special purpose entity is able    to sell, on a revolving basis, undivided ownership interests in    the eligible receivables to bank conduits. During the term of    the facility, we must maintain certain performance ratios. If we    fail to maintain these ratios, we could be prevented from    accessing this cost-effective source of working capital and    short-term financing.     We believe that our cash flow from operations, together with our    cash on hand and access to existing credit facilities and our    accounts receivable securitization facility, are adequate for    current and planned needs    14Table of Contents    in 2006. However, our actual experience may differ from these    expectations. Factors that may lead to a difference include, but    are not limited to, the matters discussed herein, as well as    future events that might have the effect of reducing our    available cash balance, such as unexpected material operating    losses or increased capital or other expenditures, as well as    increases in inventory or accounts receivable that are    ineligible for sale under our securitization facility, or future    events that may reduce or eliminate the availability of external    financial resources.     We also may choose to finance our capital needs, from time to    time, through the issuance of debt securities. Our ability to    issue such securities on satisfactory terms, if at all, will    depend on the state of our business and financial condition, any    ratings issued by major credit rating agencies, market interest    rates, and the overall condition of the financial and credit    markets at the time of the offering. The condition of the credit    markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the    past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Variations in    these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt    securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order    to sell new debt securities. The failure to receive financing on    desirable terms, or at all, could damage our ability to support    our future operations or capital needs or engage in other    business activities.     As of December 25, 2005, we had approximately    $527.7 million of total principal amount of indebtedness    outstanding. If we are unable to generate sufficient available    cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to    refinance such debt or face default. There is no guarantee that    we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms, or at    all. This total indebtedness includes $249,996 in aggregate    principal amount of 2.75% senior convertible debentures    that we issued in 2001. On December 1, 2011 and    December 1, 2016, and upon the occurrence of certain    fundamental corporate changes, holders of the 2.75% senior    convertible debentures may require us to purchase their    debentures. At that time, the purchase price may be paid in    cash, shares of common stock or a combination of the two, at our    discretion, provided that we will pay accrued and unpaid    interest in cash. We may not have sufficient cash at that time    to make the required repurchases and may be required to settle    in shares of common stock.     We previously issued warrants that provide the holder with an    option through January 2008 to sell all of these warrants to us    for a price to be paid, at our election, of either $100,000 in    cash or $110,000 in our common stock, such stock being valued at    the time of the exercise of the option. Should we be required to    settle these warrants under this option, we believe that we will    have adequate funds to settle in cash if necessary. However, we    may not have sufficient funds at that time to make the required    payment and may be required to settle the warrants in stock. As a    manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational    corporation, we are subject to various government regulations,    violation of which could subject us to sanctions. In addition,    we could be the subject of future product liability suits, which    could harm our business.     As a manufacturer of consumer products, we are subject to    significant government regulations under The Consumer Products    Safety Act, The Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and The    Flammable Fabrics Act. In addition, certain of our products are    subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration. While    we take all the steps we believe are necessary to comply with    these acts, there can be no assurance that we will be in    compliance in the future. Failure to comply could result in    sanctions which could have a negative impact on our business,    financial condition and results of operations.     In addition to government regulation, products that have been or    may be developed by us may expose us to potential liability from    personal injury or property damage claims by the users of such    products. There can be no assurance that a claim will not be    brought against us in the future. While we currently maintain    product liability insurance coverage in amounts we believe    sufficient for our business risks, we may not be able to    maintain such coverage or such coverage may not be adequate to    cover all potential claims. Moreover, even if we maintain    sufficient insurance coverage, any successful claim could    significantly harm our business, financial condition and results    of operations.     As a large, multinational corporation, we are subject to a host    of governmental regulations throughout the world, including    antitrust, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott    regulations and the Foreign Corrupt    15Table of Contents    Practices Act. Our failure to successfully comply with any such    legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and    other sanctions that could harm our business and financial    condition. We    have a material amount of goodwill which, if it becomes    impaired, would result in a reduction in our net    income.     Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of an acquisition    accounted for using the purchase method exceeds the fair value    of the net assets we acquire. Current accounting standards    require that goodwill no longer be amortized but instead be    periodically evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of    the reporting unit. At December 25, 2005, approximately    $467,061 or 14.1%, of our total assets represented goodwill.    Declines in our profitability may impact the fair value of our    reporting units, which could result in a further write-down of    our goodwill. Reductions in our net income caused by the    write-down of goodwill could harm our results of operations. "
