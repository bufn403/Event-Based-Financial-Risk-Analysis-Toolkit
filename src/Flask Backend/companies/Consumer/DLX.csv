12,DLX,DELUXE CORP,2024-02-22,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSWe routinely encounter and address risks, many of which could cause our future results to be materially different than we currently anticipate. These risks include, but are not limited to, the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We place no priority or likelihood based on these descriptions or order of presentation. We are also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, including overall economic, industry and market conditions. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect us. You should carefully consider all of these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock.STRATEGIC RISKSIf our long-term growth strategy is not successful, our business and financial results would be adversely impacted.Our strategy is to utilize the cash flows, customer relationships and brand equity from our print businesses to drive profitable organic growth in our payments and data businesses. Further information about our strategy can be found under the caption ""Our Strategy"" appearing in Part I, Item 1 of this report. We may not achieve our long-term objectives, and investments in our business may fail to impact our financial results as anticipated. Our strategic plan could fall short of our expectations for many reasons, including, among others:•our failure to generate profitable revenue growth;•our inability to acquire new customers, retain our current customers and sell more products and services to current and new customers;•our inability to implement additional improvements to our technology infrastructure, our digital services offerings and other key assets to increase efficiency, enhance our competitive advantage and scale our operations;•our failure to develop new products and services;•our failure to effectively manage the growth, expanding complexity and pace of change of our business and operations;•our inability to effectively operate, integrate or leverage businesses we acquire;•the failure of new products and services to achieve widespread customer acceptance;•our inability to promote, strengthen and protect our brand;•an unexpected change in demand for checks or other products;•our failure to attract and retain skilled talent to execute our strategy and sustain our growth;•unanticipated changes in our business, markets, industry or the competitive landscape; and•general economic conditions.We can provide no assurance that our strategy will be successful, either in the short term or in the long term, that it will generate a positive return on our investment or that it will not materially reduce our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (""adjusted EBITDA"") margins. If our strategy is not successful, or if there is market perception that our strategy is not successful, our reputation and brand may be damaged and our stock price may fall.If we are unable to attract and retain customers in a cost-effective manner or effectively operate a multichannel customer experience, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.Our success depends on our ability to attract new and returning customers in a cost-effective manner. We use a variety of methods to promote our products and services, including a direct sales force, partner referrals, email marketing, purchased search results from online search engines, direct mail advertising, broadcast media, advertising banners, social media and other 11online links. Certain of these methods may become less effective or more expensive. For example, response rates for direct mail advertising have been decreasing for some time, internet search engines could modify their algorithms or increase prices for purchased search results, or certain partner referrals could decline. Because we offer a diverse portfolio of products and services, we may also face challenges in increasing customer awareness of all of our offerings. Efforts to expand customer awareness of our diverse range of products and services may result in increased marketing expense and may fail to generate additional revenue.We continually evaluate and modify our marketing and sales efforts to achieve the most effective mix of promotional methods. Competitive pressure may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the prices of our products and services and/or new marketing strategies may not be successful. Either of these occurrences would have an adverse impact on our ability to compete and our results of operations would be adversely affected. In addition, when our check supply contracts expire, customers have the ability to renegotiate their contracts with us or to consider changing suppliers. Failure to achieve favorable contract renewals and/or to obtain new check supply customers would result in decreased revenue.Additionally, we believe we must maintain a relevant, multichannel experience in order to attract and retain customers. Customers expect to have the ability to choose their method of ordering, whether via the mail, computer, phone or mobile device. Although we are constantly investing in our user experience, we cannot predict the success of these investments. Multichannel marketing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with the changing expectations of our customers and new developments by our competitors. If we are unable to implement improvements to our customer-facing technology in a timely manner, or if our customer-facing technology does not function as designed, we could find it increasingly difficult to attract new and returning visitors, which would result in decreased revenue.We face intense competition from other businesses, and we expect that competition will continue to increase.Competition in the payments industry is intense. We are competing against numerous financial technology (""Fintech"") companies, including independent payment processors, credit card processing firms and treasury management service providers, as well as financial institution in-house capabilities. Volume is the key to remaining cost-competitive, and breadth of services is critical to staying relevant to customers. In addition, although we are a leading check printer in the U.S., we face considerable competition in the check printing portion of the payments industry from another large check printer in our traditional financial institution sales channel, from direct mail and internet-based sellers of personal and business checks, from check printing software vendors, and from certain significant retailers. Pricing continues to be competitive in our financial institution sales channel, as financial institutions seek to maintain their previous levels of profitability, even as check usage declines.Within our Data Solutions segment, our data-driven marketing services face competition from a wide variety of companies in the data solutions space, including advertising agencies, marketing technology firms, data aggregators and brokers, and source data providers. Adapting to new technology is a key challenge in this business, along with hiring and retaining the right people.Within our Promotional Solutions segment, the markets for business forms and promotional products are intensely competitive and highly fragmented. Current and potential competitors include traditional storefront printing companies, office superstores, wholesale printers, online printing companies, small business product resellers, and providers of custom apparel and gifts. The competitive landscape for online suppliers continues to be challenging as new businesses enter the space.We can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. Our competitors may develop better products or technologies and may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Continued competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and/or loss of customers, all of which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.If we do not adapt to changes in technology in a timely and cost-effective manner, we could lose clients or have trouble attracting new clients, and our ability to grow may be limited.Rapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes impact the markets for our products and services, including changes in payment and internet browser technologies and the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as developments in technologies supporting our regulatory and compliance obligations and in-store, digital, mobile and social commerce. The introduction of competing products and services using new technologies, the evolution of industry standards or the introduction of more attractive products or services, including continued increases in the digitization of payments, could make some of our products and services less desirable, or even obsolete. Our ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative products and services will significantly affect our future success. The impact is magnified by the intense competition we face. To be successful, our technology-based products and services must keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards, address the ever-changing and increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers, and achieve market acceptance. Additionally, we must differentiate our service offerings from those of our competitors and from the in-house capabilities of our customers. We could lose current and potential customers if we are unable to develop products and services that meet changing demands in a timely manner. Additionally, we must continue to develop our skills, tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies, and this requires significant investment, takes 12considerable time and ultimately, may not be successful. Any of the foregoing risks could result in harm to our business, results of operations and growth prospects.The use of checks and business forms is declining and we may be unable to offset the decline with profitable revenue growth.Checks continue to be a significant portion of our business, accounting for 32.9% of our consolidated revenue in 2023, and providing a significant amount of the cash flows we invest in our growth businesses. We sell checks for personal and business use and believe that there will continue to be demand for personal and business checks for the foreseeable future, although the total number of checks written in the U.S. has been in decline since the 1990s. We expect that the number of checks written will continue to decline due to the digitization of payments, including debit cards, credit cards, direct deposit, wire transfers, and other payment solutions, such as PayPal®, Apple Pay®, Square®, Zelle®, and Venmo®, as well as cryptocurrencies. In addition, the RTP® system run by The Clearing House Payments Company, LLC is a real-time payments system that currently reaches approximately 65% of U.S. bank accounts, and the U.S. Federal Reserve's real-time payments system, FedNow®, went live in July 2023.The rate and the extent to which digital payments will replace checks, whether as a result of legislative developments, changing payment systems, personal preference or otherwise, cannot be predicted with certainty. Increased use of alternative payment methods, or our inability to successfully offset the secular decline in checks with new check supply clients or other sources of revenue, would have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows and results of operations.The use of business forms has also been declining. Continual technological improvements, including the lower price and higher performance capabilities of personal computers, printers and mobile devices, have provided small business customers with alternative means to execute and record business transactions. Additionally, electronic transaction systems, off-the-shelf business software applications, web-based solutions and mobile applications have been designed to replace preprinted business forms. Greater acceptance of electronic signatures also has contributed to the overall secular decline in printed products. It is difficult to predict the pace at which these alternative products and services will replace standardized business forms. If small business preferences change rapidly and we are unable to develop new products and services with comparable operating margins, our results of operations would be adversely affected.Our business depends on our strong and trusted brand, and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance our brand would hurt our business.We have developed a strong and trusted brand that has contributed significantly to the success of our business. We believe that maintaining and promoting our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our products and services, expanding our base of customers, and attracting and retaining top talent. We believe that the importance of brand recognition and trust is particularly essential for the success of our various service offerings because of the level of competition for these services. Customer awareness of our brand, as well as the perceived value of our brand, depends largely on the success of our marketing efforts, our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, secure and innovative products and services, and our ability to maintain trust and be a technology leader. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business could be materially and adversely affected. There is also the risk that adverse publicity, whether or not justified, could adversely affect our business. If our business partners or key employees are the subject of adverse news reports or negative publicity, our reputation may be tarnished and our results of operations could be adversely affected.A component of our brand promotion strategy is building on our relationship of trust with our customers, which we believe can be achieved by providing a high-quality customer experience. We have invested, and will continue to invest, in website development, design and technology, and customer service and production operations. Our ability to provide a high-quality customer experience is also dependent on external factors, including the reliability and performance of our suppliers, telecommunications providers and third-party carriers. Our brand value also depends on our ability to protect and use our customers' data in a manner that meets expectations. The failure of our brand promotion activities to meet our expectations or the failure to provide a high-quality customer experience for any reason could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and maintain customer relationships, which would adversely harm our business and results of operations.Our cost reduction initiatives may not be successful.Intense competition and secular declines in the use of checks and business forms compels us to continually improve our operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve profitability. Cost reduction initiatives have required, and will continue to require, up-front expenditures related to various actions, such as redesigning and streamlining processes, standardizing technology applications, further enhancing our strategic supplier sourcing arrangements, improving real estate utilization and funding employee severance benefits. We can provide no assurance that we will achieve future cost reductions or that we will do so without incurring unexpected or greater than anticipated expenditures. Moreover, we may find that we are unable to achieve business simplification and/or cost reduction goals without disrupting our business, negatively impacting efforts to grow our business or reducing the effectiveness of our sustainability practices. As a result, we may choose to delay or forgo certain cost 13reductions as business conditions require. Failure to continue to improve our operating efficiency and to generate adequate savings to fund necessary investments could adversely affect our business if we are unable to remain competitive.We may be unable to successfully identify future acquisitions, integrate past and future acquisitions or realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions.We have completed many acquisitions, including the acquisition of First American Payment Systems, L.P. in June 2021, which was the largest acquisition in our history. In addition, we have, at times, purchased the operations of small business distributors with the intention of growing revenue in our dealer channels. We have devoted significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of our acquisitions.The integration of any acquisition involves numerous risks, including, among others:•the inability to successfully combine the businesses in a manner that permits us to achieve the revenue synergies and cost savings anticipated, which would result in the anticipated benefits of the acquisition not being realized in the anticipated timeframe or at all;•difficulties and/or delays in assimilating operations and ensuring that a strong system of information security and controls is in place;•the complexities of integrating a company with different products, services, markets and customers;•performance shortfalls due to the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;•lost sales and customers as a result of certain customers, retail partners, financial institutions or other third parties deciding not to do business with us;•unanticipated integration costs; •complexities associated with implementing necessary controls for the acquired business activities to address our requirements as a public company;•difficulties in identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming functions and assets;•the complexities of assimilating the acquired business into our corporate culture and management philosophies;•unidentified issues not discovered during our due diligence process, including product or service quality issues, intellectual property issues, and tax or legal contingencies; •failure to address legacy distributor account protection rights; and•loss of key employees.One or more of these factors could impact our ability to successfully operate, integrate or leverage an acquisition and could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.We may supplement sales-driven revenue growth with strategically targeted acquisitions over time. The time and expense associated with finding suitable businesses, technologies or services to acquire can be disruptive to our ongoing business and may divert management’s attention. We cannot predict whether suitable acquisition candidates can be identified or acquired on acceptable terms or whether any acquired products, technologies or businesses will contribute to our revenue or earnings to any material extent. We may need to seek additional financing for larger acquisitions, which would increase our debt obligations, and such financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us. Additionally, acquisitions may result in additional contingent liabilities, additional amortization expense, and/or future non-cash asset impairment charges related to acquired intangible assets and goodwill, and thus, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our inability to complete certain divestitures or the effects of divesting a business could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.From time to time, we may divest businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives. For instance, we recently completed the exit from our web hosting business, and we are in the process of exiting our payroll and human resources services business. We may not be able to complete desired divestitures on favorable terms. Losses on the sales of, or lost earnings from, those businesses could negatively affect our profitability and margins. Additionally, we  may incur asset impairment charges related to potential divestitures that reduce our profitability. Our divestiture activities may also present operational risks, including the diversion of management's attention from our other businesses, difficulties separating personnel and systems, the need to provide transition services to buyers, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.14OPERATIONAL RISKSSecurity breaches, computer malware or other cyberattacks involving the confidential information of our customers, employees or business partners could substantially damage our reputation, subject us to litigation and enforcement actions, and substantially harm our business and results of operations.Information security risks have increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and an increase in remote work arrangements, as well as the increased sophistication and activities of hackers, terrorists and activists. We use internet-based channels that collect customers’ financial account and payment information, as well as other sensitive information, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, contractors, suppliers and business partners. Each year, we process hundreds of millions of records containing data related to individuals and businesses. We also provide services that are instrumental in supporting our customers and their businesses, such as merchant services and remittance processing. Cybersecurity is one of the top risks identified by our Enterprise Risk Management Committee, as technology-based organizations such as ours are vulnerable to targeted attacks aimed at exploiting network and system weaknesses.The secure and uninterrupted operation of our networks and systems, as well as the processing, maintenance and confidentiality of the sensitive information that resides on our systems, is critical to our business operations and strategy. We have a risk-based information/cybersecurity program dedicated to protecting our data and solutions. We employ a defense-in-depth strategy, utilizing the concept of security layers and the CIA (confidential, integrity and availability) triad model. Computer systems and networks are, by nature, vulnerable to unauthorized access. An accidental or willful security breach could result in unauthorized access and/or use of customer information, including consumers' personally identifiable information or, in some cases, the protected health information of certain individuals. Our security measures could be breached by third-party action, computer viruses, accidents, employee or contractor error, or malfeasance by rogue employees. Individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent controls and/or exploit vulnerabilities that may exist, resulting in the disclosure or misuse of sensitive business and personal customer or employee information and data.We depend on a number of third parties, including vendors, developers and partners, that are critical to our business and to which we may grant access to our customer or employee data. We have established a vendor security program that assesses the risk of these partners, and certain of our third-party relationships are subject to security requirements as specified in written contracts. However, we cannot control the actions of our third-party providers, and any cyberattacks or security breaches they experience could adversely affect our ability to service our customers or otherwise conduct our business.Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage computer systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect immediately, and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities, fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving employees and contractors. Additionally, our customers and employees have been and will continue to be targeted by threat actors using social engineering techniques to obtain confidential information or using fraudulent ""phishing"" emails to introduce malware into the environment. To-date, these various threats and incidents have not materially impacted our customers, our business or our financial results. However, our technologies, systems and networks are likely to be the target of future attacks due to the increasing threat landscape for all technology businesses, and we can provide no assurance that future incidents will not be material.Despite our significant cybersecurity systems and processes, a party that circumvents our security measures could misappropriate our own, our customers' or our partners' personal or proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation, all of which could deter clients and consumers from ordering our products and services and result in the termination of client contracts. Additionally, it is possible that there could be vulnerabilities that impact large segments of mobile, computer or server architecture. Any of these events would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, if we were to experience a material information security breach, we may be required to expend significant amounts of management time and financial resources to remedy, protect against or mitigate the effects of the breach, and we may not be able to remedy the situation in a timely manner, or at all. Furthermore, under payment card association rules and our contracts with debit and credit card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store or that is stored by third parties with which we do business, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and other related expenses. We could also lose our ability to accept and process credit and debit card payments, which would likely result in the loss of customers and the inability to attract new customers. We could also be exposed to time-consuming and expensive litigation, government inquiries and/or enforcement actions. If we are unsuccessful in defending a claim regarding information security breaches, we may be forced to pay damages, penalties and fines, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to compensate us fully for any losses that may occur. Contractual provisions with third parties, including cloud service providers, may limit our ability to recover losses resulting from the security breach of a business partner.15There are international, federal and state laws and regulations requiring companies to notify individuals of information security breaches involving their personal data, the cost of which would negatively affect our financial results. These mandatory disclosures regarding an information security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity. If we were required to make such a disclosure, it may cause our clients and customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our information security measures. Likewise, general publicity regarding information security breaches at other companies could lead to the perception among the general public that e-commerce is not secure. This could decrease traffic to our websites, negatively affect our financial results and limit future business opportunities.Interruptions to our website operations or information technology systems or the failure to maintain our information technology platforms could damage our reputation and harm our business.The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our information technology systems, and those of our third-party service providers, is critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers. We could experience temporary interruptions in our websites, transaction and payment processing systems, network infrastructure, service technologies, printing production facilities or customer service operations for a variety of reasons, including, among others, human error, software errors or design faults, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, electrical disruptions, labor issues, vandalism, fire, flood, extreme weather, terrorism and other events beyond our control. In addition, certain of the services we deliver to the payments technology market are designed to process complex transactions and deliver reports and other information on those transactions, all at very high volumes and processing speeds. Any failure to deliver an effective and secure product or any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors or other losses. We have invested, and will continue to invest, significant resources to build out, maintain and improve our technology platforms. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design, implementation or operation of our systems, particularly any disruptions, delays or deficiencies that impact our operations, could adversely affect our ability to effectively run and manage our business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our operations could cause customers to believe that our products and services are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our products and services. A substantial portion of our applications reside in a cloud-based environment. While we maintain redundant systems and backup databases and applications software designed to provide continuous access to cloud services, it is possible that access to our software capabilities could be interrupted and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. The failure of our systems could interfere with the delivery of products and services to our customers, impede our customers' ability to do business and result in the loss or corruption of critical data. In addition to the potential loss of customers, we may be required to incur additional development costs and divert technical and other resources, and we may be the subject of negative publicity and/or liability claims. If any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issue in a timely manner, our results of operations would be adversely affected, and our business interruption insurance coverage may not be adequate to compensate us fully for any losses we may incur. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or contractual counterparties, those customers and contractual counterparties could seek compensation from us for their losses, and those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address.We rely on third parties and their systems for a variety of services, including significant information technology services, and the failure of these third parties to provide these services could disrupt our business.We have entered into agreements with third-party providers for information technology services, including telecommunications, network server, cloud computing and transaction processing services. In addition, we have agreements with companies to provide services related to our online payment solutions, including financial institutions that provide clearing services in connection with our merchant services settlement activities, and we have outsourced certain activities, including portions of our finance and procurement functions. A service provider's ability to provide services could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including, among others, human error, software errors or design faults, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, electrical disruptions, labor issues, vandalism, fire, flood, extreme weather, terrorism and other events beyond their control. In the event that one or more of our service providers is unable to provide adequate or timely services, our ability to deliver products and services to our customers could be adversely affected. Although we believe we have taken reasonable steps to protect our business through contractual arrangements with our service providers, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of disruption in service. Any significant disruption could harm our business, including damage to our brand and loss of customers. Additionally, although we believe that most of these services are available from numerous sources, a failure to perform by one or more of our service providers could cause a material disruption in our business while we obtain an alternative service provider. The use of substitute third-party providers could also result in increased expense. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk.16 If we are unable to attract, motivate and retain key personnel and other qualified employees, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.We operate in a rapidly changing technological environment that requires a wide ranging set of expertise and intellectual capital. To successfully compete and grow, we must recruit, develop, motivate and retain personnel who can provide the needed expertise across the organization. In addition, we must develop our personnel to fulfill succession plans capable of maintaining continuity in the midst of the inevitable unpredictability of human capital.Competition for employees is intense. We have implemented various human capital initiatives, including employee wellness initiatives, employee resource groups and a revised performance management process, to make Deluxe an attractive place to work. As remote working arrangements have become more widely accepted, it is more challenging for us to maintain and enhance our corporate culture and to navigate the flexible working arrangements that employees may demand. Our work environment may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may be perceived as less favorable compared to other companies' polices, which could negatively impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. We can provide no assurance that key personnel, including our executive officers, will continue to be employed, or that in the event we have to replace key employees, that labor costs will not increase. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Increases in prices and declines in the availability of materials and other services have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our operating results.We are subject to risks associated with the cost and availability of paper, plastics, ink, promotional materials, merchant services point-of-sale equipment and other raw materials, as well as various third-party services we utilize, including delivery and data provider services. In addition, from time-to-time, the card networks, including Visa® and Mastercard®, increase the fees that they charge processors. Increased levels of inflation have resulted in cost increases for certain of the materials and services we utilize. Inflationary pressures could continue into fiscal 2024, and this trend could have a material adverse impact if inflation rates significantly exceed our ability to achieve price increases or if such price increases adversely impact demand for our products. We have, at times, experienced supply chain disruptions, including impacts on the supply of certain printed products in our Promotional Solutions segment, and continuing global unrest could cause further disruption in the global supply chain. We continue to closely monitor our supply chain to promptly address any delays or disruptions, but we can provide no assurance that our ability to provide products to our customers will not be adversely impacted if our supply chain is compromised.Paper costs represent a significant portion of our materials expense. Paper is a commodity and its price has been subject to volatility due to supply and demand in the marketplace, as well as volatility in the raw material and other costs incurred by paper suppliers. There are also relatively few paper suppliers and these suppliers are under financial pressure as paper use declines. As such, when our suppliers increase paper prices, we may not be able to obtain better pricing from alternative suppliers.We depend upon third-party providers for delivery services and for certain outsourced products. Events resulting in the inability of these third parties to perform their obligations, such as work slowdowns, extended labor strikes, labor shortages or inclement weather, could adversely impact our results of operations by requiring us to secure alternate providers at higher costs. Postal rates are dependent on the operating efficiency of the U.S. Postal Service (""USPS"") and on legislative mandates imposed upon the USPS. Postal rates have increased in recent years and the USPS has incurred significant financial losses. This may result in continued changes to the breadth and/or frequency of USPS mail delivery services. In addition, fuel costs have fluctuated over the past several years. Increases in fuel costs increase the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers, as well as the price we pay for outsourced products.Competitive pressures and/or contractual arrangements may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the price of our products and services. Any of the foregoing risks could result in harm to our business and results of operations.We are subject to customer payment-related risks and payment card network rules, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.We may be liable for fraudulent transactions conducted on our websites, such as the use of stolen credit card numbers, and we have potential liability for fraudulent electronic payment transactions or credits initiated by merchants or others. While we do have safeguards in place, we cannot prevent all fraudulent transactions. To date, we have not incurred material losses from payment-related fraud. However, such transactions negatively impact our results of operations and could subject us to penalties from payment card networks for inadequate fraud protection.We also may be liable if our merchants or other parties that have obligations to deliver goods or services to cardholders fail to satisfy their obligations. For example, we may be subject to contingent liability for transactions originally acquired by us that are disputed by the cardholder and charged back to the merchants or other parties. These disputes could arise from fraud, misuse, unintentional use, settlement delay or failure, insufficiency of funds, returns, a failure to perform a service, or other reasons. If we are unable to collect this amount from the merchant or other party because of the merchant’s or other party’s insolvency or other reasons, we will bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder. Although we have an active 17program to manage our credit risk, a default on such obligations by one or more of our merchants or others could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.In addition, in order to provide our transaction processing services, we are registered with Visa and Mastercard and other networks as members or service providers for member institutions. As such, we are subject to card association and network rules. Changes to the payment card networks' rules or how they are interpreted could have a significant impact on our business and financial results. For example, changes in the rules regarding chargebacks may affect our ability to dispute chargebacks and the amount of losses we incur from chargebacks. Changes in network rules may also increase the cost of, impose restrictions on, or otherwise impact the development of, our retail point-of-sale solutions, which may negatively affect their deployment and adoption. Any changes to or interpretations of the network rules that are inconsistent with the way we currently operate may require us to make changes to our business that could be costly or difficult to implement and that could adversely affect our results of operations.Revenue from the sale of services to merchants that accept Visa and Mastercard are dependent upon our continued Visa and Mastercard registrations, financial institution sponsorship and, in some cases, continued membership in certain card networks.In order to provide our Visa and Mastercard transaction processing services, we must be either a direct member or be registered as a merchant processor or service provider of Visa and Mastercard. Registration as a merchant processor or service provider is dependent upon our being sponsored by members of each organization in certain jurisdictions. If our sponsor financial institution in any market should stop providing sponsorship for us, we would need to find another financial institution to provide those services or we would need to attain direct membership with the card networks, either of which could prove to be difficult and expensive. If we are unable to find a replacement financial institution to provide sponsorship or attain direct membership, we may no longer be able to provide processing services to affected customers, which would negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, some agreements with our financial institution sponsors give them substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices, including our solicitation, application and qualification procedures for merchants and the terms of our agreements with merchants. Our sponsors' discretionary actions under these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.If we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the card networks, the card networks could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our registrations or membership. The termination of our registrations or our membership or our status as a service provider or a merchant processor would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If a merchant or an independent sales organization (""ISO"") customer fails to comply with the applicable requirements of the card associations and networks, we or the merchant or ISO could be subject to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks. If we cannot collect or pursue collection of such amounts from the applicable merchant or ISO, we may have to bear the cost of such fines or penalties, negatively impacting our results of operations.LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKSGovernmental regulation is continuously evolving and could limit or harm our business.We are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local laws and regulations that affect our business activities in several areas, including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, taxation, data privacy and security, digital content, consumer reports, consumer protection, merchant processing, online payment services, real estate, e-commerce, intellectual property, health care, environmental matters, and workplace health and safety. In addition, legal or regulatory measures to address climate change may impact us in the near future. The complexity of complying with existing and new laws and regulations is significant, and regulators may adopt new laws or regulations at any time.The various regulatory requirements to which we are subject could impose significant limitations on our business activities, require changes to our business, restrict our use or storage of personal information, or cause changes in our customers' purchasing behavior, which may make our business more costly and/or less efficient and may require us to modify our current or future products, services, systems or processes. We cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of such changes on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Portions of our business operate within highly regulated industries and our business results could be significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which we are subject. For example, international, federal and state laws and regulations regarding the protection of certain consumer information require us to develop, implement and maintain policies and procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of consumers' personal information. Portions of our business are subject to regulations affecting payment processing, including merchant processing, ACH, remote deposit capture and lockbox services. These laws and regulations require us to develop, implement and maintain certain policies and procedures related to payments. We are also subject to additional requirements in certain of our contracts with financial institution clients that are often more restrictive than the regulations, as well as confidentiality clauses in certain of our contracts related to small businesses’ customer information. These regulations and agreements typically limit our ability to use or disclose personal information for other than the purposes 18originally intended, which could limit business opportunities. Proposed privacy and cybersecurity regulations may also increase the cost of compliance for the protection of collected data. The complexity of compliance with these various regulations may increase our cost of doing business and may affect our clients, reducing their discretionary spending and thus, reducing their capacity to purchase our products and services.Due to our increased use of the internet for sales and marketing, laws specifically governing digital commerce, the internet, mobile applications, search engine optimization, behavioral advertising, privacy and email marketing may have an impact on our business. Existing and future laws governing issues such as digital and social marketing, privacy, consumer protection or commercial email may limit our ability to market and provide our products and services. Changing data protection regulations may increase the cost of compliance in servicing domestic and international markets for our wholesale and retail business services channels. More restrictive rules, such as new privacy laws, consumer protection “dark patterns” restrictions, search engine marketing restrictions, “anti-spam” regulations or email privacy rules, could decrease marketing opportunities, decrease traffic to our websites and/or increase the cost of obtaining new customers.Because of additional regulatory costs, financial institutions may continue to put significant pricing pressure on their suppliers, including their check and service providers. The increase in cost and profit pressure may also lead to further consolidation of financial institutions. Additionally, some financial institutions do not permit offers of add-on services, such as bundled products, fraud/identity protection or expedited check delivery, to their customers. It would have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we were unable to market such services to consumers or small businesses through the majority of our financial institution clients. Additionally, as our product and service offerings become more technologically focused, and with expanded regulatory expectations for supervision of third-party service providers, additional portions of our business could become subject to direct federal regulation and/or examination. This would increase our cost of doing business and could slow our ability to introduce new products and services and otherwise adapt to a rapidly changing business environment.   Third-party claims could result in costly and distracting litigation and, in the event of an unfavorable outcome, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.From time to time, we are involved in claims, litigation and other proceedings related to the conduct of our business,  including purported class action litigation. Such legal proceedings may include claims related to our employment practices; claims alleging breach of contractual obligations; claims asserting deceptive, unfair or illegal business practices; claims alleging violations of consumer protection-oriented laws; claims related to legacy distributor account protection rights; or claims related to environmental matters. In addition, third parties may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us and/or our clients, which could include aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by non-practicing entities. Any such claims could result in litigation against us and could also result in proceedings being brought against us by various federal and state agencies that regulate our businesses. The number and significance of these claims and proceedings has increased as our businesses have evolved and expanded in scope. These claims, whether successful or not, could divert management's attention, result in costly and time-consuming litigation, or both. Accruals for identified claims or lawsuits are established based on our best estimate of the probable liability. However, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and other dispute resolution mechanisms. Any unfavorable outcome of a material claim or material litigation could require the payment of monetary damages or fines, attorneys' fees or costly and undesirable changes to our products, features or business practices, which would result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may be unable to protect our rights in intellectual property, which could harm our business and ability to compete.We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret and patent protection, and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks, software and other intellectual property. These protective measures afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products or services that do not infringe on our intellectual property rights. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. We may be required to spend significant resources to protect our trade secrets and to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete.FINANCIAL RISKSEconomic conditions may adversely affect trends in business and consumer spending, which may adversely impact demand for our products and services.Economic conditions have affected, and will continue to affect, our results of operations and financial position. Current and future economic conditions that affect inflation, business and consumer spending, including levels of business and consumer confidence, unemployment levels, consumer spending and the availability of credit, as well as uncertainty or volatility in our customers' businesses, may adversely affect our business and results of operations. A challenging economic environment could cause existing and potential customers to not purchase or to delay purchasing our products and services. Continued inflationary 19pressures could negatively impact our customers' ability to purchase our products and services, thereby negatively impacting our revenue and results of operations.A significant portion of our business relies on small business spending. We believe that small businesses are more likely to be significantly affected by economic conditions than larger, more established companies. During a sluggish economy, it may be more difficult for small businesses to obtain credit and they may choose to spend their limited funds on items other than our products and services. As such, the level of small business confidence, the rate of small business formations and closures, and the availability of credit to small businesses all impact our business.A significant portion of our business also relies upon the health of the financial services industry. As a result of global economic conditions in past years, a number of financial institutions sought additional capital, merged with other financial institutions and, in some cases, failed. The failure of one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or large portions of our customer base, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to the possibility of losing a significant client, the inability to recover prepaid product discount payments made to one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or the inability to collect accounts receivable or contractually required contract termination payments, could have a negative impact on our results of operations.There may also be an increase in financial institution mergers and acquisitions during periods of economic uncertainty or as a result of other factors affecting the financial services industry. Such an increase could adversely affect our operating results. Often the newly combined entity seeks to reduce costs by leveraging economies of scale in purchasing, including its check supply and business services contracts. This results in providers competing intensely on price in order to retain not only their previous business with one of the financial institutions, but also to gain the business of the other party in the combined entity. Although we devote considerable effort toward the development of a competitively-priced, high-quality selection of products and services for the financial services industry, there can be no assurance that significant financial institution clients will be retained or that the impact of the loss of a significant client can be offset through the addition of new clients or by expanded sales to our remaining clients.Global events, such as outbreaks of illnesses, pandemics like COVID-19, or other political and economic instability, significantly increase economic uncertainty. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of these events, we cannot predict the impact on our business, financial position or results of operations. Even after such impacts subside, the U.S. economy may experience a recession, and our business could be adversely affected by a prolonged recession.Asset impairment charges would have a negative impact on our results of operations.Goodwill represented 46.4% of our total assets as of December 31, 2023. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether the carrying value of goodwill is impaired. This analysis considers several factors, including economic, market and industry conditions. Circumstances that could indicate a decline in the fair value of one or more of our reporting units include, but are not limited to, the following:•a downturn in economic conditions that negatively affects our actual and forecasted operating results;•changes in our business strategy, structure and/or the allocation of resources;•the failure of our growth strategy;•the inability of our acquisitions to achieve expected operating results;•changes in market conditions, including increased competition; •the loss of significant customers;•a decline in our stock price for a sustained period; or•a material acceleration of order volume declines for checks or business forms.Such situations may require us to record an impairment charge for a portion of goodwill. We are also required to assess the carrying value of other long-lived assets, including intangible assets. Information regarding our 2023 impairment analyses can be found under the caption ""Note 8: Fair Value Measurements"" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We have, in the past, and may again in the future, be required to write-down the value of some of our assets, and these write-downs have been, and could in the future be, material to our results of operations. If we are required to record additional asset impairment charges for any reason, our consolidated results of operations would be adversely affected.Our variable-rate indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk.Borrowings under our credit facility, including our secured term loan facility, are subject to variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to continue to increase, our interest expense would increase, negatively affecting earnings and reducing cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures and other investments. To address the risk associated with variable-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our variable-rate debt to a fixed rate. As of December 31, 2023, $357.5 million of our outstanding debt was subject to variable interest rates.20"
4,DLX,DELUXE CORP,2023-02-24,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSWe routinely encounter and address risks, many of which could cause our future results to be materially different than we currently anticipate. These risks include, but are not limited to, the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We place no priority or likelihood based on these descriptions or order of presentation. We are also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, including overall economic, industry and market conditions. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect us. You should carefully consider all of these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock.STRATEGIC RISKSIf our long-term growth strategy is not successful, our business and financial results would be adversely impacted.Our vision is to be a trusted technology partner empowering businesses to pay, get paid and grow. Further information about our strategy can be found under the caption ""Our Strategy"" appearing in Part I, Item 1 of this report. We may not achieve our long-term objectives, and investments in our business may fail to impact our financial results as anticipated. Our strategic plan could fall short of our expectations for many reasons, including, among others:•our failure to generate profitable revenue growth;•our inability to acquire new customers, retain our current customers and sell more products and services to current and new customers;•our failure to fully utilize new sales technology that enables a single view of our customers;•our inability to implement additional improvements to our technology infrastructure, our digital services offerings and other key assets to increase efficiency, enhance our competitive advantage and scale our operations;•our failure to develop new products and services;•our failure to effectively manage the growth, expanding complexity and pace of change of our business and operations;•our inability to effectively operate, integrate or leverage businesses we acquire;•the failure of new products and services to achieve widespread customer acceptance;•our inability to promote, strengthen and protect our brand;•an unexpected change in demand for checks or other products;•our failure to attract and retain skilled talent to execute our strategy and sustain our growth;•unanticipated changes in our business, markets, industry or the competitive landscape; and•general economic conditions.We can provide no assurance that our strategy will be successful, either in the short term or in the long term, that it will generate a positive return on our investment or that it will not materially reduce our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA) margins. If our strategy is not successful, or if there is market perception that our strategy is not successful, our reputation and brand may be damaged and our stock price may fall.If we are unable to attract and retain customers in a cost-effective manner or effectively operate a multichannel customer experience, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.Our success depends on our ability to attract new and returning customers in a cost-effective manner. We use a variety of methods to promote our products and services, including a direct sales force, partner referrals, email marketing, purchased search results from online search engines, direct mail advertising, broadcast media, advertising banners, social media and other online links. Certain of these methods may become less effective or more expensive. For example, response rates for direct mail advertising have been decreasing for some time, internet search engines could modify their algorithms or increase prices for purchased search results or certain partner referrals could decline. Because we offer a diverse portfolio of products and services, we may also face challenges in increasing customer awareness of all of our offerings. Efforts to expand customer awareness of our diverse range of products and services may result in increased marketing expense and may fail to generate additional revenue.We continually evaluate and modify our marketing and sales efforts to achieve the most effective mix of promotional methods. Competitive pressure may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the prices of our products and services and/or 12new marketing strategies may not be successful. Either of these occurrences would have an adverse impact on our ability to compete and our results of operations would be adversely affected. In addition, when our check supply contracts expire, customers have the ability to renegotiate their contracts with us or to consider changing suppliers. Failure to achieve favorable contract renewals and/or to obtain new check supply customers would result in decreased revenue.Additionally, we believe we must maintain a relevant, multichannel experience in order to attract and retain customers. Customers expect to have the ability to choose their method of ordering, whether via the mail, computer, phone or mobile device. Although we are constantly investing in our user experience, we cannot predict the success of these investments. Multichannel marketing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with the changing expectations of our customers and new developments by our competitors. If we are unable to implement improvements to our customer-facing technology in a timely manner, or if our customer-facing technology does not function as designed, we could find it increasingly difficult to attract new and returning visitors, which would result in decreased revenue.We face intense competition from other business enterprises, and we expect that competition will continue to increase.Competition in the payments industry is intense. We are competing against numerous financial technology (Fintech) companies, including independent payment processors, credit card processing firms and treasury management service providers, as well as financial institution in-house capabilities. Volume is the key to staying cost-competitive, and breadth of services is critical to staying relevant to customers. In addition, although we are a leading check printer in the U.S., we face considerable competition in the check printing portion of the payments industry from another large check printer in our traditional financial institution sales channel, from direct mail and internet-based sellers of personal and business checks, from check printing software vendors, and from certain significant retailers. Pricing continues to be competitive in our financial institution sales channel, as financial institutions seek to maintain their previous levels of profitability, even as check usage declines.Within our Data Solutions segment, our data-driven marketing services face intense competition from a wide variety of companies in the data solutions space, including advertising agencies, marketing technology firms, data aggregators and brokers, and source data providers. Adapting to new technology is a key challenge in this business, along with hiring and retaining the right people.Within our Promotional Solutions segment, the markets for business forms and promotional products are intensely competitive and highly fragmented. Current and potential competitors include traditional storefront printing companies, office superstores, wholesale printers, online printing companies, small business product resellers and providers of custom apparel and gifts. The competitive landscape for online suppliers continues to be challenging as new businesses enter the space.We can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. Our competitors may develop better products or technologies and may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Continued competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and/or loss of customers, all of which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.If we do not adapt to changes in technology in a timely and cost-effective manner, we could lose clients or have trouble attracting new clients, and our ability to grow may be limited.Rapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes impact the markets for our products and services, including changes in payment and internet browser technologies and the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as developments in technologies supporting our regulatory and compliance obligations and in-store, digital, mobile and social commerce. The introduction of competing products and services using new technologies, the evolution of industry standards or the introduction of more attractive products or services, including continued increases in the digitization of payments, could make some of our products and services less desirable, or even obsolete. Our ability to enhance our current products and services and to develop and introduce innovative products and services will significantly affect our future success. The impact is magnified by the intense competition we face. To be successful, our technology-based products and services must keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards, address the ever-changing and increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers, and achieve market acceptance. Additionally, we must differentiate our service offerings from those of our competitors and from the in-house capabilities of our customers. We could lose current and potential customers if we are unable to develop products and services that meet changing demands in a timely manner. Additionally, we must continue to develop our skills, tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies, and this requires significant investment, takes considerable time and ultimately, may not be successful. Any of the foregoing risks could result in harm to our business, results of operations and growth prospects.We may be unable to successfully identify future acquisitions, integrate past and future acquisitions and realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions.We have completed many acquisitions during the past several years, including the acquisition of First American in June 2021, which was the largest acquisition in our history. In addition, we purchased the operations of several small business distributors with the intention of growing revenue in our dealer channels. We are currently devoting significant management 13attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of First American and our previous acquisitions. The integration of any acquisition involves numerous risks, including, among others:•the inability to successfully combine the businesses in a manner that permits us to achieve the revenue synergies and cost savings anticipated to result from the acquisition, which would result in the anticipated benefits of the acquisition not being realized in the anticipated timeframe or at all;•difficulties and/or delays in assimilating operations and ensuring that a strong system of information security and controls is in place;•the complexities of integrating a company with different products, services, markets and customers;•performance shortfalls due to the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;•lost sales and customers as a result of certain customers, retail partners, financial institutions or other third parties deciding not to do business with us;•unanticipated integration costs; •complexities associated with implementing necessary controls for the acquired business activities to address our requirements as a public company;•difficulties in identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming functions and assets;•the complexities of assimilating the acquired business into our corporate culture and management philosophies;•unidentified issues not discovered during our due diligence process, including product or service quality issues, intellectual property issues and tax or legal contingencies; •failure to address legacy distributor account protection rights; and•loss of key employees.One or more of these factors could impact our ability to successfully operate, integrate or leverage an acquisition and could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.We have indicated that we plan to supplement sales-driven revenue growth with strategically targeted acquisitions over time. The time and expense associated with finding suitable businesses, technologies or services to acquire can be disruptive to our ongoing business and may divert management’s attention. We cannot predict whether suitable acquisition candidates can be identified or acquired on acceptable terms or whether any acquired products, technologies or businesses will contribute to our revenue or earnings to any material extent. We may need to seek additional financing for larger acquisitions, which would increase our debt obligations and may not be available on terms that are favorable to us. Additionally, acquisitions may result in additional contingent liabilities, additional amortization expense, and/or future non-cash asset impairment charges related to acquired intangible assets and goodwill, and thus, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The use of checks and forms is declining and we may be unable to offset the decline with profitable revenue growth.Checks continue to be a significant portion of our business, accounting for 32.6% of our consolidated revenue in 2022, and providing a significant amount of the cash flows we invest in our growth businesses, although our Payments segment now rivals our Checks segment in terms of revenue. We sell checks for personal and business use and believe that there will continue to be demand for personal and business checks for the foreseeable future, although the total number of checks written in the U.S. has been in decline since the mid-1990s. We expect that the number of checks written will continue to decline due to the digitization of payments, including debit cards, credit cards, direct deposit, wire transfers, and other payment solutions, such as PayPal®, Apple Pay®, Square®, Zelle®, and Venmo®, as well as cryptocurrencies. In addition, the RTP® system run by The Clearing House Payments Company, LLC is a real-time payments system that currently reaches approximately 60% of U.S. bank accounts. The U.S. Federal Reserve has announced that it plans to develop its own real-time payments system, FedNowSM, with an expected launch in mid-2023.The rate and the extent to which digital payments will replace checks, whether as a result of legislative developments, changing payment systems, personal preference or otherwise, cannot be predicted with certainty. Increased use of alternative payment methods, or our inability to successfully offset the secular decline in check usage with new check supply clients or other sources of revenue, would have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows and results of operations.The use of business forms has also been declining. Continual technological improvements, including the lower price and higher performance capabilities of personal computers, printers and mobile devices, have provided small business customers with alternative means to execute and record business transactions. Additionally, electronic transaction systems, off-the-shelf business software applications, web-based solutions and mobile applications have been designed to replace preprinted business forms. Greater acceptance of electronic signatures also has contributed to the overall secular decline in printed products. It is difficult to predict the pace at which these alternative products and services will replace standardized business forms. If small business preferences change rapidly and we are unable to develop new products and services with comparable operating margins, our results of operations would be adversely affected.14Our business depends on our strong and trusted brand, and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance our brand would hurt our business.We have developed a strong and trusted brand that has contributed significantly to the success of our business. We believe that maintaining and promoting our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our products and services, expanding our base of customers, and attracting and retaining top talent throughout the organization. We believe that the importance of brand recognition and trust is particularly essential for the success of our various service offerings because of the level of competition for these services. Customer awareness of our brand, as well as the perceived value of our brand, depends largely on the success of our marketing efforts, our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, secure and innovative products and services, and our ability to maintain trust and be a technology leader. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business could be materially and adversely affected. There is also the risk that adverse publicity, whether or not justified, could adversely affect our business. If our business partners or key employees are the subject of adverse news reports or negative publicity, our reputation may be tarnished and our results of operations could be adversely affected.A component of our brand promotion strategy is building on our relationship of trust with our customers, which we believe can be achieved by providing a high-quality customer experience. We have invested, and will continue to invest, in website development, design and technology, and customer service and production operations. Our ability to provide a high-quality customer experience is also dependent on external factors, including the reliability and performance of our suppliers, telecommunications providers and third-party carriers. Our brand value also depends on our ability to protect and use our customers' data in a manner that meets expectations. The failure of our brand promotion activities to meet our expectations or our failure to provide a high-quality customer experience for any reason could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and maintain customer relationships, which would adversely harm our business and results of operations.Our cost reduction initiatives may not be successful.Intense competition and secular declines in the use of checks and business forms compels us to continually improve our operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve profitability. Cost reduction initiatives have required, and will continue to require, up-front expenditures related to various actions, such as redesigning and streamlining processes, consolidating information technology platforms, standardizing technology applications, further enhancing our strategic supplier sourcing arrangements, improving real estate utilization and funding employee severance benefits. We can provide no assurance that we will achieve future cost reductions or that we will do so without incurring unexpected or greater than anticipated expenditures. Moreover, we may find that we are unable to achieve business simplification and/or cost reduction goals without disrupting our business, negatively impacting efforts to grow our business or reducing the effectiveness of our sustainability practices. As a result, we may choose to delay or forgo certain cost reductions as business conditions require. Failure to continue to improve our operating efficiency and to generate adequate savings to fund necessary investments could adversely affect our business if we are unable to remain competitive. OPERATIONAL RISKSWe are unable to predict the extent to which COVID-19 or other outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics, or public health crises may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.Although the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have declined, the sweeping nature of the pandemic makes it extremely difficult to predict how our business and operations may be affected in the longer term. The extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact our business depends on future developments, many of which are unknown, such as: the severity and duration of the pandemic, including the impact of COVID-19 variants; governmental, business and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; vaccination rates; and the resulting impact on economic activity and the financial markets. There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the COVID-19 pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change.In addition to the above impacts, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, all of our employees who had the ability to work from home did so, and the success of our work-from-home model allowed us to accelerate certain site closures. Although our facilities re-opened in late 2021, a portion of our employees now work remotely on a permanent basis and many others work remotely for portions of each work week, which increases our cybersecurity and data security risk. Changes in the scope and severity of the pandemic may cause us to once again close certain of our facilities to protect the health of our employees, as a result of disruptions in the operation of our supply chain, or in response to a prolonged decrease in demand for our products and services. Disruptions caused by future facility closures, along with the subsequent reintroduction of employees back into the workplace, could introduce operational risks, negatively impact productivity or result in claims by employees.Other cascading effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, along with other outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics or public health crises that are not currently foreseeable, could materially increase our costs, negatively impact our revenue and adversely impact our results of operations and liquidity, possibly to a significant degree. We cannot predict the severity or duration of any 15such impacts. Such events could have the effect of heightening or exacerbating many of the other risks described in this Risk Factors
 discussion.Security breaches, computer malware or other cyberattacks involving the confidential information of our customers, employees or business partners could substantially damage our reputation, subject us to litigation and enforcement actions, and substantially harm our business and results of operations.Information security risks have increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and an increase in remote work arrangements, as well as the increased sophistication and activities of hackers, terrorists and activists. In addition, our information security risks have increased with the acquisition of companies with their own technologies, which we continue to integrate into our systems and processes. Until these technologies are integrated, we may experience a period of increased risk. We use internet-based channels that collect customers’ financial account and payment information, as well as other sensitive information, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, contractors, suppliers and business partners. Each year, we process hundreds of millions of records containing data related to individuals and businesses. We also provide services that are instrumental in supporting our customers and their businesses, such as website/email hosting and remittance processing. Cybersecurity is one of the top risks identified by our Enterprise Risk Management Committee, as technology-based organizations such as ours are vulnerable to targeted attacks aimed at exploiting network and system weaknesses.The secure and uninterrupted operation of our networks and systems, as well as the processing, maintenance and confidentiality of the sensitive information that resides on our systems, is critical to our business operations and strategy. We have a risk-based information/cybersecurity program dedicated to protecting our data and solutions. We employ a defensive in-depth strategy, utilizing the concept of security layers and the CIA (confidential, integrity and availability) triad model. Computer systems and networks are, by nature, vulnerable to unauthorized access. An accidental or willful security breach could result in unauthorized access and/or use of customer information, including consumers' personally identifiable information or, in some cases, the protected health information of certain individuals. Our security measures could be breached by third-party action, computer viruses, accidents, employee or contractor error, or malfeasance by rogue employees. In addition, we depend on a number of third parties, including vendors, developers and partners, that are critical to our business and to which we may grant access to our customer or employee data. While we conduct due diligence on these third parties with respect to their security and business controls, we rely on them to effectively monitor and oversee these control measures. Individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent controls and/or exploit vulnerabilities that may exist, resulting in the disclosure or misuse of sensitive business and personal customer or employee information and data.We utilize third-party providers to help support and provide our services to customers. We have established a vendor security program that assesses the risk of these partners, and certain of our third-party relationships are subject to security requirements as specified in written contracts. However, we cannot control the actions of our third-party providers, and any cyberattacks or security breaches they experience could adversely affect our ability to service our customers or otherwise conduct our business.Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage computer systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect immediately, and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities, fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving employees and contractors. We have experienced external internet-based attacks by threat actors aimed at disrupting internet traffic and/or attempting to place illegal or abusive content on our or our customers’ websites. Additionally, our customers and employees have been and will continue to be targeted by threat actors using social engineering techniques to obtain confidential information or using fraudulent ""phishing"" emails to introduce malware into the environment. To-date, these various threats and incidents have not materially impacted our customers, our business or our financial results. However, our technologies, systems and networks are likely to be the target of future attacks due to the increasing threat landscape for all technology businesses, and we can provide no assurance that future incidents will not be material.Despite our significant cybersecurity systems and processes, a party that circumvents our security measures could misappropriate our own, our customers' or our partners' personal or proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation, all of which could deter clients and consumers from ordering our products and services and result in the termination of client contracts. Additionally, it is possible that there could be vulnerabilities that impact large segments of mobile, computer or server architecture. Any of these events would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, if we were to experience a material information security breach, we may be required to expend significant amounts of management time and financial resources to remedy, protect against or mitigate the effects of the breach, and we may not be able to remedy the situation in a timely manner, or at all. Furthermore, under payment card association rules and our contracts with debit and credit card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store or that is stored by third parties with which we do business, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and other related expenses. We could also lose our ability to accept and process credit and debit card payments, which would likely result in the loss of customers and the inability to attract new customers. We could also be exposed to time-consuming and 16expensive litigation, government inquiries and/or enforcement actions. If we are unsuccessful in defending a claim regarding information security breaches, we may be forced to pay damages, penalties and fines, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to compensate us fully for any losses that may occur. Contractual provisions with third parties, including cloud service providers, may limit our ability to recover losses resulting from the security breach of a business partner.There are international, federal and state laws and regulations requiring companies to notify individuals of information security breaches involving their personal data, the cost of which would negatively affect our financial results. These mandatory disclosures regarding an information security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity. If we were required to make such a disclosure, it may cause our clients and customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our information security measures. Likewise, general publicity regarding information security breaches at other companies could lead to the perception among the general public that e-commerce is not secure. This could decrease traffic to our websites, negatively affect our financial results and limit future business opportunities.Interruptions to our website operations or information technology systems, failure to maintain our information technology platforms, or failure to successfully implement our new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system could damage our reputation and harm our business.The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our information technology systems, and those of our third-party service providers, is critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers. We could experience temporary interruptions in our websites, transaction and payment processing systems, network infrastructure, service technologies, printing production facilities or customer service operations for a variety of reasons, including, among others, human error, software errors or design faults, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, electrical disruptions, labor issues, vandalism, fire, flood, extreme weather, terrorism and other events beyond our control. We have invested, and will continue to invest, significant resources to build out, maintain and improve our technology platforms and to integrate our various businesses. We are in the process of converting to a new ERP system. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design, implementation or operation of our systems, particularly any disruptions, delays or deficiencies that impact our operations, including smoothly executing the implementation of our ERP system, could adversely affect our ability to effectively run and manage our business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our operations could cause customers to believe that our products and services are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our products and services.In recent years, we shifted a substantial portion of our applications to a cloud-based environment. While we maintain redundant systems and backup databases and applications software designed to provide continuous access to cloud services, it is possible that access to our software capabilities could be interrupted and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. The failure of our systems could interfere with the delivery of products and services to our customers, impede our customers' ability to do business and result in the loss or corruption of critical data. In addition to the potential loss of customers, we may be required to incur additional development costs and divert technical and other resources, and we may be the subject of negative publicity and/or liability claims. If any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issue in a timely manner, our results of operations would be adversely affected, and our business interruption insurance coverage may not be adequate to compensate us fully for any losses we may incur. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or contractual counterparties, these customers and contractual counterparties could seek compensation from us for their losses, and those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address.We rely on third parties and their systems for a variety of services, including significant information technology services, and the failure of these third parties to provide these services could disrupt our business.We have entered into agreements with third-party providers for information technology services, including telecommunications, network server, cloud computing and transaction processing services. In addition, we have agreements with companies to provide services related to our online payment solutions, including financial institutions that provide clearing services in connection with our merchant services settlement activities, and we have outsourced certain activities, including portions of our finance and procurement functions. A service provider's ability to provide services could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including, among others, human error, software errors or design faults, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, electrical disruptions, labor issues, vandalism, fire, flood, extreme weather, terrorism and other events beyond their control. In the event that one or more of our service providers is unable to provide adequate or timely services, our ability to deliver products and services to our customers could be adversely affected. Although we believe we have taken reasonable steps to protect our business through contractual arrangements with our service providers, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of disruption in service. Any significant disruption could harm our business, including damage to our brand and loss of customers. Additionally, although we believe that most of these services are available from numerous sources, a failure to perform by one or more of our service providers could cause a material disruption in our business while we obtain an alternative service provider. The use of substitute third-party providers could also result in increased expense. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of 17control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. If we are unable to attract, motivate and retain key personnel and other qualified employees, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.We operate in a rapidly changing technological environment that requires a wide ranging set of expertise and intellectual capital. To successfully compete and grow, we must recruit, develop, motivate and retain personnel who can provide the needed expertise across the organization. In addition, we must develop our personnel to fulfill succession plans capable of maintaining continuity in the midst of the inevitable unpredictability of human capital.Competition for employees is intense, even more so in the current challenging labor market. We have implemented various human capital initiatives, including employee wellness initiatives, the introduction of employee resource groups and a revised performance management process, to make Deluxe an attractive place to work. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote working arrangements became more widely accepted and it is more challenging for us to maintain and enhance our corporate culture and to navigate the flexible working arrangements that employees may demand. Our work environment may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may be perceived as less favorable compared to other companies' polices, which could negatively impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. We can provide no assurance that key personnel, including our executive officers, will continue to be employed, or that in the event we have to replace key employees, that labor costs will not increase. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Increases in prices and declines in the availability of materials and other services have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our operating results.We are subject to risks associated with the cost and availability of paper, plastics, ink, promotional materials, merchant services point-of-sale equipment and other raw materials, as well as various third-party services we utilize, including delivery services. In addition, from time-to-time, the card networks, including Visa® and Mastercard®, increase the fees that they charge processors. Increased levels of inflation during the past 2 years have resulted in cost increases for certain of the materials and services we utilize. We expect inflationary pressures to continue into fiscal 2023, and this trend could have a material adverse impact if inflation rates significantly exceed our ability to continue to achieve price increases or if such price increases adversely impact demand for our products. Emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced supply chain disruptions, including impacts on the supply of certain higher margin printed products in our Promotional Solutions segment, and the continuing Russia-Ukraine dispute could cause further disruption in the global supply chain. We continue to closely monitor our supply chain to promptly address any further delays or disruptions, but we can provide no assurance that our ability to provide products to our customers will not be adversely impacted if our supply chain is compromised.Paper costs represent a significant portion of our materials expense. Paper is a commodity and its price has been subject to volatility due to supply and demand in the marketplace, as well as volatility in the raw material and other costs incurred by paper suppliers. There are also relatively few paper suppliers and these suppliers are under financial pressure as paper use declines. As such, when our suppliers increase paper prices, we may not be able to obtain better pricing from alternative suppliers.We depend upon third-party providers for delivery services and for certain outsourced products. Events resulting in the inability of these third parties to perform their obligations, such as work slowdowns, extended labor strikes, labor shortages or inclement weather, could adversely impact our results of operations by requiring us to secure alternate providers at higher costs. Postal rates are dependent on the operating efficiency of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and on legislative mandates imposed upon the USPS. Postal rates have increased in recent years and the USPS has incurred significant financial losses. This may result in continued changes to the breadth and/or frequency of USPS mail delivery services. In addition, fuel costs have fluctuated over the past several years. Increases in fuel costs increase the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers, as well as the price we pay for outsourced products.Competitive pressures and/or contractual arrangements may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the price of our products and services. Any of the foregoing risks could result in harm to our business and results of operations.We are subject to customer payment-related risks and payment card network rules, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.We may be liable for fraudulent transactions conducted on our websites, such as the use of stolen credit card numbers, and we have potential liability for fraudulent electronic payment transactions or credits initiated by merchants or others. While we do have safeguards in place, we cannot prevent all fraudulent transactions. To date, we have not incurred significant losses from payment-related fraud. However, such transactions negatively impact our results of operations and could subject us to penalties from payment card networks for inadequate fraud protection. 18In addition, changes to the payment card networks' rules or how they are interpreted could have a significant impact on our business and financial results. For example, changes in the rules regarding chargebacks may affect our ability to dispute chargebacks and the amount of losses we incur from chargebacks. Changes in network rules may also increase the cost of, impose restrictions on, or otherwise impact the development of, our retail point-of-sale solutions, which may negatively affect their deployment and adoption. Any changes to or interpretations of the network rules that are inconsistent with the way we currently operate may require us to make changes to our business that could be costly or difficult to implement and that could adversely affect our results of operations.Revenue from the sale of services to merchants that accept Visa and Mastercard are dependent upon our continued Visa and Mastercard registrations, financial institution sponsorship and, in some cases, continued membership in certain card networks.In order to provide our Visa and Mastercard transaction processing services, we must be either a direct member or be registered as a merchant processor or service provider of Visa and Mastercard. Registration as a merchant processor or service provider is dependent upon our being sponsored by members of each organization in certain jurisdictions. If our sponsor financial institution in any market should stop providing sponsorship for us, we would need to find another financial institution to provide those services or we would need to attain direct membership with the card networks, either of which could prove to be difficult and expensive. If we are unable to find a replacement financial institution to provide sponsorship or attain direct membership, we may no longer be able to provide processing services to affected customers, which would negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, some agreements with our financial institution sponsors give them substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices, including our solicitation, application and qualification procedures for merchants and the terms of our agreements with merchants. Our sponsors' discretionary actions under these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.If we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the card networks, the card networks could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our registrations or membership. The termination of our registrations or our membership or our status as a service provider or a merchant processor would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If a merchant or an independent sales organization (ISO) customer fails to comply with the applicable requirements of the card associations and networks, we or the merchant or ISO could be subject to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks. If we cannot collect or pursue collection of such amounts from the applicable merchant or ISO, we may have to bear the cost of such fines or penalties, negatively impacting our results of operations.LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKSGovernmental regulation is continuously evolving and could limit or harm our business.We are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local laws and regulations that affect our business activities in several areas, including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, taxation, data privacy and security, digital content, consumer reports, consumer protection, merchant processing, online payment services, real estate, e-commerce, intellectual property, health care, environmental matters, and workplace health and safety. In addition, legal or regulatory measures to address climate change may impact us in the near future. The complexity of complying with existing and new laws and regulations is significant, and regulators may adopt new laws or regulations at any time.The various regulatory requirements to which we are subject could impose significant limitations on our business activities, require changes to our business, restrict our use or storage of personal information, or cause changes in our customers' purchasing behavior, which may make our business more costly and/or less efficient and may require us to modify our current or future products, services, systems or processes. We cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of such changes on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Portions of our business operate within highly regulated industries and our business results could be significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which we are subject. For example, international, federal and state laws and regulations regarding the protection of certain consumer information require us to develop, implement and maintain policies and procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of consumers' personal information. Portions of our business are subject to regulations affecting payment processing, including merchant processing, ACH, remote deposit capture and lockbox services. These laws and regulations require us to develop, implement, and maintain certain policies and procedures related to payments. We are also subject to additional requirements in certain of our contracts with financial institution clients and communications service providers, which are often more restrictive than the regulations, as well as confidentiality clauses in certain of our contracts related to small businesses’ customer information. These regulations and agreements typically limit our ability to use or disclose personal information for other than the purposes originally intended, which could limit business opportunities. Proposed privacy and cybersecurity regulations may also increase the cost of compliance for the protection of collected data. The complexity of compliance with these various regulations may increase our cost of doing business and may affect our clients, reducing their discretionary spending and thus, reducing their capacity to purchase our products and services.19Due to our increased use of the internet for sales and marketing, laws specifically governing digital commerce, the internet, mobile applications, search engine optimization, behavioral advertising, privacy and email marketing may have an impact on our business. Existing and future laws governing issues such as digital and social marketing, privacy, consumer protection or commercial email may limit our ability to market and provide our products and services. Changing data protection regulations may increase the cost of compliance in servicing domestic and international markets for our wholesale and retail business services channels. More restrictive rules, such as new privacy laws, consumer protection “dark patterns” restrictions, search engine marketing restrictions, “anti-spam” regulations or email privacy rules, could decrease marketing opportunities, decrease traffic to our websites and/or increase the cost of obtaining new customers.Because of additional regulatory costs, financial institutions may continue to put significant pricing pressure on their suppliers, including their check and service providers. The increase in cost and profit pressure may also lead to further consolidation of financial institutions. Additionally, some financial institutions do not permit offers of add-on services, such as bundled products, fraud/identity protection or expedited check delivery, to their customers. It would have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we were unable to market such services to consumers or small businesses through the majority of our financial institution clients. Additionally, as our product and service offerings become more technologically focused, and with expanded regulatory expectations for supervision of third-party service providers, additional portions of our business could become subject to direct federal regulation and/or examination. This would increase our cost of doing business and could slow our ability to introduce new products and services and otherwise adapt to a rapidly changing business environment.   Third-party claims could result in costly and distracting litigation and, in the event of an unfavorable outcome, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.From time to time, we are involved in claims, litigation and other proceedings related to the conduct of our business,  including purported class action litigation. Such legal proceedings may include claims related to our employment practices; claims alleging breach of contractual obligations; claims asserting deceptive, unfair or illegal business practices; claims alleging violations of consumer protection-oriented laws; claims related to legacy distributor account protection rights; or claims related to environmental matters. In addition, third parties may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us and/or our clients, which could include aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by non-practicing entities. Any such claims could result in litigation against us and could also result in proceedings being brought against us by various federal and state agencies that regulate our businesses. The number and significance of these claims and proceedings has increased as our businesses have evolved and expanded in scope. These claims, whether successful or not, could divert management's attention, result in costly and time-consuming litigation, or both. Accruals for identified claims or lawsuits are established based on our best estimates of the probable liability. However, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and other dispute resolution mechanisms. Any unfavorable outcome of a material claim or material litigation could require the payment of monetary damages or fines, attorneys' fees or costly and undesirable changes to our products, features or business practices, which would result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may be unable to protect our rights in intellectual property, which could harm our business and ability to compete.We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret and patent protection, and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks, software and other intellectual property. These protective measures afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products or services that do not infringe on our intellectual property rights. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. We may be required to spend significant resources to protect our trade secrets and to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete.Activities of our customers or the content of their websites could damage our reputation and/or adversely affect our financial results.As a provider of domain name registration, web hosting services and customized business products, we may be subject to potential liability for the activities of our customers on or in connection with their domain names or websites, for the data they store on our servers, including information accessible through the ""dark web,"" or for images or content that we produce on their behalf. Customers may also launch distributed denial of service attacks or malicious executables, such as viruses, worms or trojan horses, from our servers. Although our agreements with our customers prohibit illegal use of our products and services and permit us to take appropriate action for such use, customers may nonetheless engage in prohibited activities or upload or store content with us in violation of applicable law. Our reputation may be negatively impacted by the actions of customers that are deemed to be hostile, offensive or inappropriate, or that infringe the copyright or trademark of another party. The safeguards we have established may not be sufficient to avoid harm to our reputation, especially if the inappropriate activities are high profile.Laws relating to the liability of online services companies for information, such as online content disseminated through their services, are subject to frequent challenges. Claims may be made against online services companies by parties who 20disagree with the content. Where the online content is accessed on the internet outside of the U.S., challenges may be brought under foreign laws that do not provide the same protections for online services companies as in the U.S. These challenges in either U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may give rise to legal claims alleging defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence or copyright or trademark infringement, based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through our services. Certain of our products and services include content generated by users of our online services. Although this content is not generated by us, claims of defamation or other injury may be made against us for that content. If such claims are successful, our financial results would be adversely affected. Even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, the time and resources necessary to resolve them could divert management’s attention and adversely affect our business and financial results.FINANCIAL RISKSEconomic conditions may adversely affect trends in business and consumer spending, which may adversely impact demand for our products and services.Economic conditions have affected, and will continue to affect, our results of operations and financial position. Current and future economic conditions that affect inflation, business and consumer spending, including levels of business and consumer confidence, unemployment levels, consumer spending and the availability of credit, as well as uncertainty or volatility in our customers' businesses, may adversely affect our business and results of operations. A challenging economic environment could cause existing and potential customers to not purchase or to delay purchasing our products and services. Continued inflationary pressures could negatively impact our customers' ability to purchase our products and services, thereby negatively impacting our revenue and results of operations.A significant portion of our business relies on small business spending. We believe that small businesses are more likely to be significantly affected by economic conditions than larger, more established companies. During a sluggish economy, it may be more difficult for small businesses to obtain credit and they may choose to spend their limited funds on items other than our products and services. As such, the level of small business confidence, the rate of small business formations and closures, and the availability of credit to small businesses all impact our business.A significant portion of our business also relies upon the health of the financial services industry. As a result of global economic conditions in past years, a number of financial institutions sought additional capital, merged with other financial institutions and, in some cases, failed. The failure of one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or large portions of our customer base, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to the possibility of losing a significant client, the inability to recover prepaid product discount payments made to one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or the inability to collect accounts receivable or contractually required contract termination payments, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.There may also be an increase in financial institution mergers and acquisitions during periods of economic uncertainty or as a result of other factors affecting the financial services industry. Such an increase could adversely affect our operating results. Often the newly combined entity seeks to reduce costs by leveraging economies of scale in purchasing, including its check supply and business services contracts. This results in providers competing intensely on price in order to retain not only their previous business with one of the financial institutions, but also to gain the business of the other party in the combined entity. Although we devote considerable effort toward the development of a competitively-priced, high-quality selection of products and services for the financial services industry, there can be no assurance that significant financial institution clients will be retained or that the impact of the loss of a significant client can be offset through the addition of new clients or by expanded sales to our remaining clients.Global events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken in response to it, as well as the Russia-Ukraine dispute, significantly increase economic uncertainty. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of these events, we cannot predict the impact on our business, financial position or results of operations. Even after such impacts subside, the U.S. economy may experience a recession, and our business could be adversely affected by a prolonged recession.Asset impairment charges would have a negative impact on our results of operations.Goodwill represented 46.5% of our total assets as of December 31, 2022. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether the carrying value of goodwill is impaired. This analysis considers several factors, including economic, market and industry conditions. Circumstances that could indicate a decline in the fair value of one or more of our reporting units include, but are not limited to, the following:•a downturn in economic conditions that negatively affects our actual and forecasted operating results;•changes in our business strategy, structure and/or the allocation of resources;•the failure of our growth strategy;•the inability of our acquisitions to achieve expected operating results;•changes in market conditions, including increased competition; 21•the loss of significant customers;•a decline in our stock price for a sustained period; or•a material acceleration of order volume declines for checks and business forms.Such situations may require us to record an impairment charge for a portion of goodwill. We are also required to assess the carrying value of other long-lived assets, including intangible assets. Information regarding our 2022 impairment analyses can be found under the caption ""Note 8: Fair Value Measurements"" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We have, in the past, and may again in the future, be required to write-down the value of some of our assets, and these write-downs have been, and could in the future be, material to our results of operations. If we are required to record additional asset impairment charges for any reason, our consolidated results of operations would be adversely affected.Our variable-rate indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk.Borrowings under our credit facility, including our secured term loan facility, are subject to variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to continue to increase, our interest expense would increase, negatively affecting earnings and reducing cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures and other investments. To address the risk associated with variable-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swaps to convert $500.0 million of our variable-rate debt to a fixed rate. As of December 31, 2022, $684.4 million of our outstanding debt was subject to variable interest rates"
2,DLX,DELUXE CORP,2022-02-28,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSWe routinely encounter and address risks, many of which could cause our future results to be materially different than we currently anticipate. These risks include, but are not limited to, the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We place no priority or likelihood based on these descriptions or order of presentation. We are also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, including overall economic, industry and market conditions. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect us. You should carefully consider all of these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock.RISKS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMICThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations.The COVID-19 pandemic began to impact our operations late in the first quarter of 2020. The impact of lost revenue was primarily driven by decreased demand in our Promotional Solutions, Checks and Cloud Solutions segments, and later in 2020 and 2021, our Payments segment experienced delays in new client implementations because of the impacts of the pandemic. Our revenue began to recover in the second half of 2021, as our customers began to resume a more normal level of activity. We 11believe that the pandemic will continue to impact our business operations, including our employees, customers, partners and communities, but there is substantial uncertainty as to the nature and degree of its continued effects over time.Beginning in March 2020, all of our employees who had the ability to work from home did so. The success of our work-from-home model allowed us to accelerate certain site closures. Although our facilities re-opened in late 2021, a portion of our employees now work remotely on a permanent basis and many others work remotely for portions of each work week, which increases our cybersecurity and data security risk. Changes in the scope and severity of the pandemic may cause us to once again close certain of our facilities to protect the health of our employees, as a result of disruptions in the operation of our supply chain, or in response to a prolonged decrease in demand for our products and services. Disruptions caused by future facility closures, along with the subsequent reintroduction of employees back into the workplace, could introduce operational risks, negatively impact productivity or result in claims by employees.The continued spread of COVID-19 has resulted in significant economic uncertainty and the global macroeconomic effects of the pandemic may persist for an indefinite period. We cannot predict the pace at which economic factors will improve or the impact a prolonged downturn in the economy would have on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in response to the pandemic, local, state, national and international governments and health authorities have, at times, established myriad new laws, rules, regulations and orders applicable to us. These emergency enactments evolve rapidly and the complexity of complying with COVID-19 specific regulations is significant.The sweeping nature of the pandemic makes it extremely difficult to predict how our business and operations will be affected in the longer term. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business depends on future developments, many of which are unknown, such as: the severity and duration of the pandemic, including the impact of COVID-19 variants; governmental, business and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; vaccination rates; and the resulting impact on economic activity and the financial markets. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience material and adverse impacts to our business as a result of the virus’s global economic impact, including a potential shift in our revenue mix as demand may change in a post-COVID environment, the availability of credit, bankruptcies or insolvencies of customers, and recession or economic downturn. There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the COVID-19 pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. Other cascading effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable could materially increase our costs, negatively impact our revenue and adversely impact our results of operations and liquidity, possibly to a significant degree. We cannot predict the severity or duration of any such impacts. The pandemic could have the effect of heightening or exacerbating many of the other risks described in this Risk Factors
 discussion. COVID-19-related impacts on the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are addressed under the caption: ""Note 19: Risks and Uncertainties"" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this report.STRATEGIC RISKSIf our long-term growth strategy is not successful, our business and financial results would be adversely impacted.Our vision is to be a trusted leader in payments and data. Further information about our strategy can be found under the caption ""Our Strategy"" appearing in Part I, Item 1 of this report. We may not achieve our long-term objectives, and investments in our business may fail to impact our financial results as anticipated. Our strategic plan could fall short of our expectations for many reasons, including, among others:•our failure to generate profitable revenue growth;•our inability to acquire new customers, retain our current customers and sell more products and services to current and new customers;•our failure to fully utilize new sales technology that enables a single view of our customers;•our inability to implement additional improvements to our technology infrastructure, our digital services offerings and other key assets to increase efficiency, enhance our competitive advantage and scale our operations;•our failure to develop new products and services;•our failure to effectively manage the growth, expanding complexity and pace of change of our business and operations;•our inability to effectively operate, integrate or leverage businesses we acquire;•the failure of new products and services to achieve widespread customer acceptance;•our inability to promote, strengthen and protect our brand;•an unfavorable change in demand for checks or other products;•our failure to attract and retain skilled talent to execute our strategy and sustain our growth;•unanticipated changes in our business, markets, industry or the competitive landscape; and•general economic conditions.We can provide no assurance that our strategy will be successful, either in the short term or in the long term, that it will generate a positive return on our investment or that it will not materially reduce our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, 12depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA) margins. If our strategy is not successful, or if there is market perception that our strategy is not successful, our reputation and brand may be damaged and our stock price may fall.If we are unable to attract and retain customers in a cost-effective manner or effectively operate a multichannel customer experience, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.Our success depends on our ability to attract new and returning customers in a cost-effective manner. We use a variety of methods to promote our products and services, including a direct sales force, partner referrals, email marketing, purchased search results from online search engines, direct mail advertising, broadcast media, advertising banners, social media and other online links. Certain of these methods may become less effective or more expensive. For example, our response rates for direct mail advertising have been decreasing for some time, internet search engines could modify their algorithms or increase prices for purchased search results or certain partner referrals could decline. Because we offer a diverse portfolio of products and services, we may also face challenges in increasing customer awareness of all of our offerings. Efforts to expand customer awareness of our diverse range of products and services may result in increased marketing expense and may fail to generate additional revenue.We continually evaluate and modify our marketing and sales efforts to achieve the most effective mix of promotional methods. Competitive pressure may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the prices of our products and services and/or new marketing strategies may not be successful. Either of these occurrences would have an adverse impact on our ability to compete and our results of operations would be adversely affected. In addition, when our check supply contracts expire, customers have the ability to renegotiate their contracts with us or to consider changing suppliers. Failure to achieve favorable contract renewals and/or to obtain new check supply customers would result in decreased revenue.Additionally, we believe we must maintain a relevant, multichannel experience in order to attract and retain customers. Customers expect to have the ability to choose their method of ordering, whether via the mail, computer, phone or mobile device. Although we are constantly making investments to update our technology, we cannot predict the success of these investments. Multichannel marketing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with the changing expectations of our customers and new developments by our competitors. If we are unable to implement improvements to our customer-facing technology in a timely manner, or if our customer-facing technology does not function as designed, we could find it increasingly difficult to attract new and returning visitors, which would result in decreased revenue.We face intense competition from other business enterprises, and we expect that competition will continue to increase.Competition in the payments industry is intense. We are competing against numerous financial technology (Fintech) companies, including independent payment processors, credit card processing firms and treasury management service providers, as well as financial institution in-house capabilities. Volume is the key to staying cost-competitive, and breadth of services is critical to staying relevant to customers. In addition, although we are a leading check printer in the U.S., we face considerable competition in the check printing portion of the payments industry from another large check printer in our traditional financial institution sales channel, from direct mail and internet-based sellers of personal and business checks, from check printing software vendors and from certain significant retailers. Pricing continues to be competitive in our financial institution sales channel, as financial institutions seek to maintain their previous levels of profitability, even as check usage declines.Within our Cloud Solutions segment, competition for our data-driven marketing services is intense, with a wide variety of companies in the data solutions space, including advertising agencies, marketing technology firms, data aggregators and brokers, and source data providers. Adapting to new technology is a key challenge in this business, along with hiring and retaining the right people. The market for our web hosting services is also highly competitive and commoditized. As such, significant spending on product development and customer acquisition is required to compete in this space, and value-added services differentiate the competition. The markets for our hosted software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions, including web design, logo design and business incorporation services, are also large, dynamic and highly competitive, with dominant integrated players, as well as niche providers.Within our Promotional Solutions segment, the markets for business forms and promotional products are intensely competitive and highly fragmented. Current and potential competitors include traditional storefront printing companies, office superstores, wholesale printers, online printing companies, small business product resellers and providers of custom apparel and gifts. The competitive landscape for online suppliers continues to be challenging as new internet businesses are introduced.We can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. Our competitors may develop better products or technologies and may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Continued competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and/or loss of customers, all of which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.13If we do not adapt to changes in technology in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to sustain and grow our business could be adversely affected.Rapid, significant, and disruptive technological changes impact the industries in which we operate, including changes in payment and internet browser technologies and the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as developments in technologies supporting our regulatory and compliance obligations and in-store, digital, mobile and social commerce. The introduction of competing products and services using new technologies, the evolution of industry standards or the introduction of more attractive products or services, including continued increases in the digitization of payments, could make some of our products and services less desirable, or even obsolete. These potential changes are magnified by the intense competition we face. To be successful, our technology-based products and services must keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards, address the ever-changing and increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers, and achieve market acceptance. Additionally, we must differentiate our service offerings from those of our competitors and from the in-house capabilities of our customers. We could lose current and potential customers if we are unable to develop products and services that meet changing demands in a timely manner. Additionally, we must continue to develop our skills, tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies, and this requires significant investment, takes considerable time and ultimately, may not be successful. Any of the foregoing risks could result in harm to our business and results of operations.We may be unable to successfully integrate past and future acquisitions and realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions.We have completed many acquisitions during the past several years, including the acquisition of First American in June 2021, which was the largest acquisition in our history. In addition, we purchased the operations of several small business distributors with the intention of growing revenue in our enterprise accounts and dealer channels. We are currently devoting significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of First American and our previous acquisitions. The integration of any acquisition involves numerous risks, including, among others:•the inability to successfully combine the businesses in a manner that permits us to achieve the revenue synergies and cost savings anticipated to result from the acquisition, which would result in the anticipated benefits of the acquisition not being realized in the anticipated timeframe or at all;•difficulties and/or delays in assimilating operations and ensuring that a strong system of information security and controls is in place;•the complexities of integrating a company with different products, services, markets and customers;•performance shortfalls due to the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;•lost sales and customers as a result of certain customers, retail partners, financial institutions or other third parties deciding not to do business with us;•unanticipated integration costs; •complexities associated with implementing necessary controls for the acquired business activities to address our requirements as a public company;•difficulties in identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming functions and assets;•the complexities of assimilating the acquired business into our corporate culture and management philosophies;•unidentified issues not discovered during our due diligence process, including product or service quality issues, intellectual property issues and tax or legal contingencies; •failure to address legacy distributor account protection rights; and•loss of key employees.One or more of these factors could impact our ability to successfully operate, integrate or leverage an acquisition and could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.We have indicated that we plan to supplement sales-driven revenue growth with strategically targeted acquisitions over time. The time and expense associated with finding suitable businesses, technologies or services to acquire can be disruptive to our ongoing business and may divert management’s attention. We cannot predict whether suitable acquisition candidates can be identified or acquired on acceptable terms or whether any acquired products, technologies or businesses will contribute to our revenue or earnings to any material extent. We may need to seek additional financing for larger acquisitions, which would increase our debt obligations and may not be available on terms that are favorable to us. Additionally, acquisitions may result in additional contingent liabilities, additional amortization expense and/or future non-cash asset impairment charges related to acquired intangible assets and goodwill, and thus, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The use of checks and forms is declining and we may be unable to offset the decline with profitable revenue growth.Checks continue to be a significant portion of our business, accounting for 34.8% of our consolidated revenue in 2021, and providing a significant amount of the cash flows we invest in our growth businesses, although we anticipate that in 2022, our Payments segment will equal our Checks segment in terms of revenue. We sell checks for personal and business use and believe that there will continue to be demand for personal and business checks for the foreseeable future, although the total number of checks written in the U.S. has been in decline since the mid-1990s. We expect that the number of checks written will 14continue to decline due to the digitization of payments, including debit cards, credit cards, direct deposit, wire transfers, and other payment solutions, such as PayPal®, Apple Pay®, Square®, Zelle®, Venmo®, as well as cryptocurrencies. In addition, the RTP® system run by The Clearing House Payments Company, LLC is a real-time payments system that currently reaches approximately 60% of U.S. bank accounts. The U.S. Federal Reserve has announced that it plans to develop its own real-time payments system, FedNowSM, with an expected launch in 2023.The rate and the extent to which digital payments will replace checks, whether as a result of legislative developments, changing payment systems, personal preference or otherwise, cannot be predicted with certainty. Increased use of alternative payment methods, or our inability to successfully offset the secular decline in check usage with new check supply clients or other sources of revenue, would have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows and results of operations.The use of business forms has also been declining. Continual technological improvements, including the lower price and higher performance capabilities of personal computers, printers and mobile devices, have provided small business customers with alternative means to execute and record business transactions. Additionally, electronic transaction systems, off-the-shelf business software applications, web-based solutions and mobile applications have been designed to replace preprinted business forms. Greater acceptance of electronic signatures also has contributed to the overall secular decline in printed products. It is difficult to predict the pace at which these alternative products and services will replace standardized business forms. If small business preferences change rapidly and we are unable to develop new products and services with comparable operating margins, our results of operations would be adversely affected.Our business depends on our strong and trusted brand, and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance our brand would hurt our business.We have developed a strong and trusted brand that has contributed significantly to the success of our business. We believe that maintaining and promoting our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our products and services and expanding our base of customers. We believe that the importance of brand recognition and trust is particularly essential for the success of our various service offerings because of the level of competition for these services. Customer awareness of our brand, as well as the perceived value of our brand, depends largely on the success of our marketing efforts and on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, secure and innovative products and services, as well as our ability to maintain trust and be a technology leader. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business could be materially and adversely affected. There is also the risk that adverse publicity, whether or not justified, could adversely affect our business. If our business partners or key employees are the subject of adverse news reports or negative publicity, our reputation may be tarnished and our results of operations could be adversely affected.A component of our brand promotion strategy is building on our relationship of trust with our customers, which we believe can be achieved by providing a high-quality customer experience. We have invested, and will continue to invest, resources in website development, design and technology, and customer service and production operations. Our ability to provide a high-quality customer experience is also dependent on external factors, including the reliability and performance of our suppliers, telecommunications providers and third-party carriers. Our brand value also depends on our ability to protect and use our customers' data in a manner that meets expectations. The failure of our brand promotion activities to meet our expectations or our failure to provide a high-quality customer experience for any reason could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and maintain customer relationships, which would adversely harm our business and results of operations.Our cost reduction initiatives may not be successful.Intense competition, secular declines in the use of checks and business forms and the commoditization of web services compels us to continually improve our operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve profitability. Cost reduction initiatives have required, and will continue to require, up-front expenditures related to various actions, such as redesigning and streamlining processes, consolidating information technology platforms, standardizing technology applications, further enhancing our strategic supplier sourcing arrangements, improving real estate utilization and funding employee severance benefits. We can provide no assurance that we will achieve future cost reductions or that we will do so without incurring unexpected or greater than anticipated expenditures. Moreover, we may find that we are unable to achieve business simplification and/or cost reduction goals without disrupting our business, negatively impacting efforts to grow our business or reducing the effectiveness of our sustainability practices. As a result, we may choose to delay or forgo certain cost reductions as business conditions require. Failure to continue to improve our operating efficiency and to generate adequate savings to fund necessary investments could adversely affect our business if we are unable to remain competitive. 15OPERATIONAL RISKSSecurity breaches, computer malware or other cyberattacks involving the confidential information of our customers, employees or business partners could substantially damage our reputation, subject us to litigation and enforcement actions, and substantially harm our business and results of operations.Information security risks have increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and an increase in remote work arrangements, as well as the increased sophistication and activities of hackers, terrorists and activists. In addition, our information security risks have increased with the acquisition of companies with their own technologies, which we continue to integrate into our systems and processes. We use internet-based channels that collect customers’ financial account and payment information, as well as other sensitive information, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, contractors, suppliers and business partners. Each year, we process hundreds of millions of records containing data related to individuals and businesses. We also provide services that are instrumental in supporting our customers and their businesses, such as website/email hosting and remittance processing. Cybersecurity is one of the top risks identified by our Enterprise Risk Management Committee, as technology-based organizations such as ours are vulnerable to targeted attacks aimed at exploiting network and system weaknesses.The secure and uninterrupted operation of our networks and systems, as well as the processing, maintenance and confidentiality of the sensitive information that resides on our systems, is critical to our business operations and strategy. We have a risk-based information/cybersecurity program dedicated to protecting our data and solutions. We employ a defensive in-depth strategy, utilizing the concept of security layers and the CIA (confidential, integrity and availability) triad model. Computer systems and networks are, by nature, vulnerable to unauthorized access. An accidental or willful security breach could result in unauthorized access and/or use of customer information, including consumers' personally identifiable information or, in some cases, the protected health information of certain individuals. Our security measures could be breached by third-party action, computer viruses, accidents, employee or contractor error, or malfeasance by rogue employees. In addition, we depend on a number of third parties, including vendors, developers and partners, that are critical to our business and to which we may grant access to our customer or employee data. While we conduct due diligence on these third parties with respect to their security and business controls, we rely on them to effectively monitor and oversee these control measures. Individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent controls and/or exploit vulnerabilities that may exist, resulting in the disclosure or misuse of sensitive business and personal customer or employee information and data.Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage computer systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect immediately, and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities, fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving employees and contractors. We have experienced external internet-based attacks by threat actors aimed at disrupting internet traffic and/or attempting to place illegal or abusive content on our or our customers’ websites. Additionally, our customers and employees have been and will continue to be targeted by threat actors using social engineering techniques to obtain confidential information or using fraudulent ""phishing"" emails to introduce malware into the environment. To-date, these various threats and incidents have not materially impacted our customers, our business or our financial results. However, our technologies, systems and networks are likely to be the target of future attacks due to the increasing threat landscape for all technology businesses, and we can provide no assurance that future incidents will not be material.Despite our significant cybersecurity systems and processes, a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our, our customers' or our partners' personal and proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation, all of which could deter clients and consumers from ordering our products and services and result in the termination of client contracts. Additionally, it is possible that there could be vulnerabilities that impact large segments of mobile, computer or server architecture. Any of these events would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, if we were to experience a material information security breach, we may be required to expend significant amounts of management time and financial resources to remedy, protect against or mitigate the effects of the breach, and we may not be able to remedy the situation in a timely manner, or at all. Furthermore, under payment card association rules and our contracts with debit and credit card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store or that is stored by third parties with which we do business, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and other related expenses. We could also lose our ability to accept and process credit and debit card payments, which would likely result in the loss of customers and the inability to attract new customers. We could also be exposed to time-consuming and expensive litigation, government inquiries and/or enforcement actions. If we are unsuccessful in defending a claim regarding information security breaches, we may be forced to pay damages, penalties and fines, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to compensate us fully for any losses that may occur. Contractual provisions with third parties, including cloud service providers, may limit our ability to recover losses resulting from the security breach of a business partner.16There are international, federal and state laws and regulations requiring companies to notify individuals of information security breaches involving their personal data, the cost of which would negatively affect our financial results. These mandatory disclosures regarding an information security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity. If we were required to make such a disclosure, it may cause our clients and customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our information security measures. Likewise, general publicity regarding information security breaches at other companies could lead to the perception among the general public that e-commerce is not secure. This could decrease traffic to our websites, negatively affect our financial results and limit future business opportunities.Interruptions to our website operations or information technology systems, or failure to maintain our information technology platforms, could damage our reputation and harm our business.The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our information technology systems, and those of our third-party service providers, is critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers. We could experience temporary interruptions in our websites, transaction and payment processing systems, network infrastructure, service technologies, printing production facilities or customer service operations for a variety of reasons, including, among others, human error, software errors or design faults, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, electrical disruptions, labor issues, vandalism, fire, flood, extreme weather, terrorism and other events beyond our control. One of the cornerstones of our growth strategy is investment in our information technology infrastructure. We have invested, and will continue to invest, significant resources to build out, maintain and improve our technology platforms and to integrate our various businesses. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design, implementation or operation of our systems, particularly any disruptions, delays or deficiencies that impact our operations, could adversely affect our ability to effectively run and manage our business. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our operations could cause customers to believe that our products and services are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our products and services.In recent years, we shifted a substantial portion of our applications to a cloud-based environment. While we maintain redundant systems and backup databases and applications software to ensure continuous access to cloud services, it is possible that access to our software capabilities could be interrupted and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. The failure of our systems could interfere with the delivery of products and services to our customers, impede our customers' ability to do business and result in the loss or corruption of critical data. In addition to the potential loss of customers, we may be required to incur additional development costs and divert technical and other resources, and we may be the subject of negative publicity and/or liability claims. If any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issue in a timely manner, our results of operations would be adversely affected, and our business interruption insurance coverage may not be adequate to compensate us fully for any losses we may incur. Moreover, to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or contractual counterparties, these customers and contractual counterparties could seek compensation from us for their losses, and those claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address.We rely on third parties and their systems for a variety of services, including significant information technology services, and the failure of these third parties to provide these services could disrupt our business.We have entered into agreements with third-party providers for information technology services, including telecommunications, network server, cloud computing and transaction processing services. In addition, we have agreements with companies to provide services related to our online payment solutions, including financial institutions that provide clearing services in connection with our merchant services settlement activities, and we have outsourced certain activities, including our sourcing and procurement function. A service provider's ability to provide services could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including, among others, human error, software errors or design faults, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, electrical disruptions, labor issues, vandalism, fire, flood, extreme weather, terrorism and other events beyond their control. In the event that one or more of our service providers is unable to provide adequate or timely services, our ability to deliver products and services to our customers could be adversely affected. Although we believe we have taken reasonable steps to protect our business through contractual arrangements with our service providers, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of disruption in service. Any significant disruption could harm our business, including damage to our brand and loss of customers. Additionally, although we believe that most of these services are available from numerous sources, a failure to perform by one or more of our service providers could cause a material disruption in our business while we obtain an alternative service provider. The use of substitute third-party providers could also result in increased expense. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk.17 If we are unable to attract, motivate and retain key personnel and other qualified employees, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.We operate in a rapidly changing technological environment that requires a wide ranging set of expertise and intellectual capital. To successfully compete and grow, we must recruit, develop, motivate and retain personnel who can provide the needed expertise across the organization. In addition, we must develop our personnel to fulfill succession plans capable of maintaining continuity in the midst of the inevitable unpredictability of human capital.Competition for employees is intense, even more so in the current challenging labor market. We have implemented various human capital initiatives, including employee wellness initiatives, the introduction of employee resource groups and a revised performance management process, to make Deluxe an attractive place to work. However, as many of our employees have been working remotely for some time due to the COVID-19 pandemic and remote working arrangements have become more widely accepted, it is more challenging for us to maintain and enhance our corporate culture and to navigate the flexible working arrangements that employees may demand. Our work environment may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may be perceived as less favorable compared to other companies' polices, which could negatively impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. We can provide no assurance that key personnel, including our executive officers, will continue to be employed, or that in the event we have to replace key employees, that labor costs will not increase. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Increases in prices and declines in the availability of materials and other services have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our operating results.We are subject to risks associated with the cost and availability of paper, plastics, ink, retail packaging supplies, promotional materials, merchant services point-of-sale equipment and other raw materials, as well as various third-party services we utilize, including delivery services. In addition, from time-to-time, the card networks, including Visa® and Mastercard®, increase the fees that they charge processors. Increased levels of inflation during 2021 have resulted in cost increases for certain of the materials and services we utilize, and inflationary pressures could continue. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic and responses to it have affected the movement of goods and services worldwide, and the Russia-Ukraine dispute could cause further disruption. Although we have not experienced a material negative impact from supply chain issues to date, we are taking steps to secure multiple sources of supply for certain of the materials and services we utilize.Paper costs represent a significant portion of our materials expense. Paper is a commodity and its price has been subject to volatility due to supply and demand in the marketplace, as well as volatility in the raw material and other costs incurred by paper suppliers. There are also relatively few paper suppliers and these suppliers are under financial pressure as paper use declines. As such, when our suppliers increase paper prices, we may not be able to obtain better pricing from alternative suppliers.We depend upon third-party providers for delivery services and for certain outsourced products. Events resulting in the inability of these third parties to perform their obligations, such as work slowdowns, extended labor strikes, labor shortages or inclement weather, could adversely impact our results of operations by requiring us to secure alternate providers at higher costs. Postal rates are dependent on the operating efficiency of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and on legislative mandates imposed upon the USPS. Postal rates have increased in recent years and the USPS has incurred significant financial losses. This may result in continued changes to the breadth and/or frequency of USPS mail delivery services. In addition, fuel costs have fluctuated over the past several years and could increase as a result of the Russia-Ukraine dispute. Increased fuel costs increase the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers, as well as the price we pay for outsourced products.Competitive pressures and/or contractual arrangements may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the price of our products and services. Any of the foregoing risks could result in harm to our business and results of operations.We are subject to customer payment-related risks and payment card network rules, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.We may be liable for fraudulent transactions conducted on our websites, such as the use of stolen credit card numbers, and we have potential liability for fraudulent electronic payment transactions or credits initiated by merchants or others. While we do have safeguards in place, we cannot prevent all fraudulent transactions. To date, we have not incurred significant losses from payment-related fraud. However, such transactions negatively impact our results of operations and could subject us to penalties from payment card networks for inadequate fraud protection. In addition, changes to the payment card networks' rules or how they are interpreted could have a significant impact on our business and financial results. For example, changes in the rules regarding chargebacks may affect our ability to dispute chargebacks and the amount of losses we incur from chargebacks. Changes in network rules may also increase the cost of, impose restrictions on, or otherwise impact the development of, our retail point-of-sale solutions, which may negatively affect their deployment and adoption. Any changes to or interpretations of the network rules that are inconsistent with the way we currently operate may require us to make changes to our business that could be costly or difficult to implement and that could adversely affect our results of operations.18Revenue from the sale of services to merchants that accept Visa and Mastercard are dependent upon our continued Visa and Mastercard registrations, financial institution sponsorship and, in some cases, continued membership in certain card networks.In order to provide our Visa and Mastercard transaction processing services, we must be either a direct member or be registered as a merchant processor or service provider of Visa and Mastercard. Registration as a merchant processor or service provider is dependent upon our being sponsored by members of each organization in certain jurisdictions. If our sponsor financial institution in any market should stop providing sponsorship for us, we would need to find another financial institution to provide those services or we would need to attain direct membership with the card networks, either of which could prove to be difficult and expensive. If we are unable to find a replacement financial institution to provide sponsorship or attain direct membership, we may no longer be able to provide processing services to affected customers, which would negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, some agreements with our financial institution sponsors give them substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices, including our solicitation, application and qualification procedures for merchants and the terms of our agreements with merchants. Our sponsors' discretionary actions under these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.If we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the card networks, the card networks could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our registrations or membership. The termination of our registrations or our membership or our status as a service provider or a merchant processor would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If a merchant or an independent sales organization (ISO) customer fails to comply with the applicable requirements of the card associations and networks, we or the merchant or ISO could be subject to a variety of fines or penalties that may be levied by the card associations or networks. If we cannot collect or pursue collection of such amounts from the applicable merchant or ISO, we may have to bear the cost of such fines or penalties, negatively impacting our results of operations.LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKSGovernmental regulation is continuously evolving and could limit or harm our business.We are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local laws and regulations that affect our business activities in several areas, including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, taxation, data privacy and security, digital content, consumer reports, consumer protection, merchant processing, online payment services, real estate, e-commerce, intellectual property, health care, environmental matters, and workplace health and safety. Additionally, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, local, state, national and international governments and health authorities have, at times, established myriad new laws, rules, regulations and orders applicable to us, many of which are required to be implemented within a very short timeframe. The complexity of complying with existing and new laws and regulations is significant, and regulators may adopt new laws or regulations at any time.The various regulatory requirements to which we are subject could impose significant limitations on our business activities, require changes to our business, restrict our use or storage of personal information, or cause changes in our customers' purchasing behavior, which may make our business more costly and/or less efficient and may require us to modify our current or future products, services, systems or processes. We cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of such changes on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Portions of our business operate within highly regulated industries and our business results could be significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which we are subject. For example, international, federal and state laws and regulations regarding the protection of certain consumer information require us to develop, implement and maintain policies and procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of consumers' nonpublic personal information. Portions of our business are subject to regulations affecting payment processing, including merchant processing, ACH, remote deposit capture and lockbox services. These laws and regulations require us to develop, implement, and maintain certain policies and procedures related to payments. We are also subject to additional requirements in certain of our contracts with financial institution clients and communications service providers, which are often more restrictive than the regulations, as well as confidentiality clauses in certain of our contracts related to small businesses’ customer information. These regulations and agreements typically limit our ability to use or disclose nonpublic personal information for other than the purposes originally intended, which could limit business opportunities. Proposed privacy and cybersecurity regulations may also increase the cost of compliance for the protection of collected data. The complexity of compliance with these various regulations may increase our cost of doing business and may affect our clients, reducing their discretionary spending and thus, reducing their capacity to purchase our products and services.Due to our increased use of the internet for sales and marketing, laws specifically governing digital commerce, the internet, mobile applications, search engine optimization, behavioral advertising, privacy and email marketing may have an impact on our business. Existing and future laws governing issues such as digital and social marketing, privacy, consumer protection or commercial email may limit our ability to market and provide our products and services. Changing data protection regulations may increase the cost of compliance in servicing domestic and international markets for our wholesale and retail 19business services channels. More restrictive legislation, such as new privacy laws, search engine marketing restrictions, “anti-spam” regulations or email privacy rules, could decrease marketing opportunities, decrease traffic to our websites and/or increase the cost of obtaining new customers.Because of additional regulatory costs, financial institutions may continue to put significant pricing pressure on their suppliers, including their check and service providers. The increase in cost and profit pressure may also lead to further consolidation of financial institutions. Additionally, some financial institutions do not permit offers of add-on services, such as bundled products, fraud/identity protection or expedited check delivery, to their customers. It would have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we were unable to market such services to consumers or small businesses through the majority of our financial institution clients. Additionally, as our product and service offerings become more technologically focused, and with expanded regulatory expectations for supervision of third-party service providers, additional portions of our business could become subject to direct federal regulation and/or examination. This would increase our cost of doing business and could slow our ability to introduce new products and services and otherwise adapt to a rapidly changing business environment.   Third-party claims could result in costly and distracting litigation and, in the event of an unfavorable outcome, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.From time to time, we are involved in claims, litigation and other proceedings related to the conduct of our business,  including purported class action litigation. Such legal proceedings may include claims related to our employment practices; claims alleging breach of contractual obligations; claims asserting deceptive, unfair or illegal business practices; claims alleging violations of consumer protection-oriented laws; claims related to legacy distributor account protection rights; or claims related to environmental matters. In addition, third parties may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us and/or our clients, which could include aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by non-practicing entities. Any such claims could result in litigation against us and could also result in proceedings being brought against us by various federal and state agencies that regulate our businesses. The number and significance of these claims and proceedings has increased as our businesses have evolved and expanded in scope. These claims, whether successful or not, could divert management's attention, result in costly and time-consuming litigation, or both. Accruals for identified claims or lawsuits are established based on our best estimates of the probable liability. However, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and other dispute resolution mechanisms. Any unfavorable outcome of a material claim or material litigation could require the payment of monetary damages or fines, attorneys' fees or costly and undesirable changes to our products, features or business practices, which would result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.A pending investigation by the Federal Trade Commission into certain business practices of First American could materially and adversely affect our business.Three operating subsidiaries of First American received separate Civil Investigative Demands dated December 27, 2019  from the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC) requesting information and documents to determine whether the subsidiaries may have engaged in conduct prohibited by the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act or the Duties of Furnishers of Information. The FTC has not yet made a final determination in this matter, and we are currently unable to predict the ultimate outcome of its investigation, or the eventual scope of damages, fines, restitution, or other equitable monetary relief that the FTC might seek to impose. We are entitled to limited indemnification under the merger agreement related to the acquisition of First American for certain expenses and losses, if any, that may be incurred with respect to certain matters, including the FTC investigation. The right to indemnification for any such expenses and losses is limited to the amount of an indemnity holdback and, except in the case of fraud, is our sole recourse for such losses. There can be no assurance that such indemnification will be sufficient to address all losses that may arise from such matters, or that the FTC’s pending investigation will not result in findings or alleged violations of laws that could lead to enforcement actions, proceedings or litigation, whether by the FTC, injunctive relief, other state or federal agencies, or other parties. The imposition of damages, fines, restitution, other equitable monetary relief or changes required to our business practices or operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.We may be unable to protect our rights in intellectual property, which could harm our business and ability to compete.We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret and patent protection, and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks, software and other intellectual property. These protective measures afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products or services that do not infringe on our intellectual property rights. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. We may be required to spend significant resources to protect our trade secrets and to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete.20Activities of our customers or the content of their websites could damage our reputation and/or adversely affect our financial results.As a provider of domain name registration, web hosting services and customized business products, we may be subject to potential liability for the activities of our customers on or in connection with their domain names or websites, for the data they store on our servers, including information accessible through the ""dark web,"" or for images or content that we produce on their behalf. Customers may also launch distributed denial of service attacks or malicious executables, such as viruses, worms or trojan horses, from our servers. Although our agreements with our customers prohibit illegal use of our products and services and permit us to take appropriate action for such use, customers may nonetheless engage in prohibited activities or upload or store content with us in violation of applicable law. Our reputation may be negatively impacted by the actions of customers that are deemed to be hostile, offensive or inappropriate, or that infringe the copyright or trademark of another party. The safeguards we have established may not be sufficient to avoid harm to our reputation, especially if the inappropriate activities are high profile.Laws relating to the liability of online services companies for information, such as online content disseminated through their services, are subject to frequent challenges. Claims may be made against online services companies by parties who disagree with the content. Where the online content is accessed on the internet outside of the U.S., challenges may be brought under foreign laws that do not provide the same protections for online services companies as in the U.S. These challenges in either U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may give rise to legal claims alleging defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence or copyright or trademark infringement, based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through our services. Certain of our products and services include content generated by users of our online services. Although this content is not generated by us, claims of defamation or other injury may be made against us for that content. If such claims are successful, our financial results would be adversely affected. Even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, the time and resources necessary to resolve them could divert management’s attention and adversely affect our business and financial results.FINANCIAL RISKSEconomic conditions, including continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect trends in business and consumer spending, which may adversely impact demand for our products and services.Economic conditions have affected, and will continue to affect, our results of operations and financial position. Current and future economic conditions that affect inflation, business and consumer spending, including levels of business and consumer confidence, unemployment levels, consumer spending and the availability of credit, as well as uncertainty or volatility in our customers' businesses, may adversely affect our business and results of operations. A challenging economic environment could cause existing and potential customers to not purchase or to delay purchasing our products and services. Continued inflationary pressures could negatively impact our customers' ability to purchase our products and services, thereby negatively impacting our revenue and results of operations.A significant portion of our business relies on small business spending. We believe that small businesses are more likely to be significantly affected by economic conditions than larger, more established companies. During a sluggish economy, it may be more difficult for small businesses to obtain credit and they may choose to spend their limited funds on items other than our products and services. As such, the level of small business confidence, the rate of small business formations and closures, and the availability of credit to small businesses all impact our business.A significant portion of our business also relies upon the health of the financial services industry. As a result of global economic conditions in past years, a number of financial institutions sought additional capital, merged with other financial institutions and, in some cases, failed. The failure of one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or large portions of our customer base, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to the possibility of losing a significant client, the inability to recover prepaid product discount payments made to one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or the inability to collect accounts receivable or contractually required contract termination payments, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.There may also be an increase in financial institution mergers and acquisitions during periods of economic uncertainty or as a result of other factors affecting the financial services industry. Such an increase could adversely affect our operating results. Often the newly combined entity seeks to reduce costs by leveraging economies of scale in purchasing, including its check supply and business services contracts. This results in providers competing intensely on price in order to retain not only their previous business with one of the financial institutions, but also to gain the business of the other party in the combined entity. Although we devote considerable effort toward the development of a competitively-priced, high-quality selection of products and services for the financial services industry, there can be no assurance that significant financial institution clients will be retained or that the impact of the loss of a significant client can be offset through the addition of new clients or by expanded sales to our remaining clients.21Global events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken in response to it, as well as the Russia-Ukraine dispute, have significantly increased economic uncertainty. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of these events, we cannot predict the impact on our business, financial position or results of operations. Even after such impacts subside, the U.S. economy may experience a recession, and our business could be adversely affected by a prolonged recession.Asset impairment charges would have a negative impact on our results of operations.Goodwill represented 46.5% of our total assets as of December 31, 2021. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether the carrying value of goodwill is impaired. This analysis considers several factors, including economic, market and industry conditions. Circumstances that could indicate a decline in the fair value of one or more of our reporting units include, but are not limited to, the following:•a downturn in economic conditions that negatively affects our actual and forecasted operating results;•changes in our business strategy, structure and/or the allocation of resources;•the failure of our growth strategy;•the inability of our acquisitions to achieve expected operating results;•changes in market conditions, including increased competition; •the loss of significant customers;•a decline in our stock price for a sustained period; or•a material acceleration of order volume declines for checks and business forms.Such situations may require us to record an impairment charge for a portion of goodwill. We are also required to assess the carrying value of other long-lived assets, including intangible assets and assets held for sale. Information regarding our 2021 impairment analyses can be found under the caption ""Note 8: Fair Value Measurements"" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We have, in the past, and may again in the future, be required to write-down the value of some of our assets, and these write-downs have been, and could in the future be, material to our results of operations. If we are required to record additional asset impairment charges for any reason, our consolidated results of operations would be adversely affected.Our variable-rate indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk.The majority of the borrowings under our credit facility, including our secured term loan facility, are subject to variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our interest expense would increase, negatively affecting earnings and reducing cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures and other investments. As of December 31, 2021, we had $1.0 billion of variable-rate debt outstanding"
14,DLX,DELUXE CORP,2021-02-19,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSOur businesses routinely encounter and address risks, many of which could cause our future results to be materially different than we currently anticipate. These risks include, but are not limited to, the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have disclosed all currently known material risks. We are also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, including overall economic, industry and market conditions. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect us. You should carefully consider all of these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock.RISKS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMICThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations.  The COVID-19 pandemic began to impact our operations late in the first quarter of 2020. The impact of lost revenue primarily affected our Promotional Solutions, Checks and Cloud Solutions segments, and late in the year, our Payments segment experienced delays in new client implementations because of the impacts of the pandemic. The sweeping nature of the pandemic makes it extremely difficult to predict how our business and operations will be affected in the longer term. Consistent with various state and federal orders, we were able to designate portions of our business as ""essential."" As such, many of our facilities remained open during government-mandated shut-downs. We successfully activated our business continuity plan to ensure uninterrupted operations and services, while keeping our facilities safe for our employees, customers and communities. Under this plan, employees who have the ability to work from home continue to do so, which poses additional cybersecurity and data security risk. Certain of our facilities remain closed. We may close additional facilities, as necessary, to protect the health of our employees, as a result of disruptions in the operation of our supply chain or in response to a prolonged decrease in demand for our products and services. If it becomes necessary to close additional facilities to protect the health of our employees, we have the ability to move work between our various facilities.As the current economic environment is significantly impacting small businesses, we are closely monitoring the breadth and depth of small business closures and bankruptcies, changes in the level of small business optimism, lending to small and mid-sized businesses and the general functioning of the credit markets, adoption of government stimulus and other economic programs, consumer unemployment levels and changes in consumer spending patterns. We cannot predict the pace at which these factors will improve or the impact a prolonged downturn in the economy will have on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.We also incurred, and may continue to incur, additional costs as we respond to the pandemic, including, but not limited to, costs incurred to implement operational changes allowing social distancing, costs related to employees who are not working during the pandemic, a Hero Pay premium provided to employees working on-site, overtime pay as required and costs associated with additional cleaning and disinfecting of our facilities. In addition, in response to the pandemic, local, state, national and international governments and health authorities have established myriad new laws, rules, regulations and orders. These 11emergency enactments evolve rapidly, and sometimes become effective within a 24-hour period. The complexity of complying with COVID-19 specific regulations is significant.All of these circumstances negatively impact our liquidity. To bolster our liquidity at the beginning of the pandemic, we drew an additional $238.0 million on our $1.15 billion revolving credit facility in March 2020. We subsequently repaid $300.0 million of the amount drawn on the credit facility. In addition, we suspended our share repurchase program and we took additional steps to reduce discretionary spending and other expenditures in line with revenue declines. These steps included temporary salary reductions for all salaried employees, including our leadership team and board of directors, project delays, furloughs and other actions. We also delayed U.S. federal payroll tax payments as permitted by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act. We continue to monitor the situation closely, including impacts on our operations, suppliers, customers, industry and workforce. If conditions deteriorate, we may implement further measures to provide additional financial flexibility and to improve our cash position and liquidity, including additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility.If demand for our products and services further deteriorates or does not return to normal levels in the longer term, we may be required to take further actions to improve our cash position, including but not limited to, implementing further employee furloughs and/or workforce reductions, or foregoing capital expenditures and other discretionary expenses. In addition, dividends are approved by our board of directors each quarter and thus, are subject to change.The situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid and the potential for a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity increases the longer the virus impacts activity levels in the U.S. and the other countries in which we operate. For this reason, we cannot reasonably estimate with any degree of certainty the future impact the pandemic may have on our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business depends on future developments, many of which are beyond our control, such as: the severity and duration of the pandemic, governmental, business and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; the timing and effectiveness of vaccines; and the resulting impact on economic activity and the financial markets. We may not have yet experienced the full impact of the pandemic or its resulting impact on our customers. Our revenue may not immediately recover with an improvement in macroeconomic conditions and may require new business formations and/or the expansion of sales to our existing customers.In completing asset impairment analyses during 2020, we were required to make assumptions using the best information available at the time, including the performance of our reporting units before and subsequent to the declaration of a pandemic and available economic forecasts. To the extent our assumptions differ materially and negatively from actual events, we may be required to record additional asset impairment charges.Other cascading effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable could materially increase our costs, negatively impact our revenue and adversely impact our results of operations and liquidity, possibly to a significant degree. We cannot predict the severity or duration of any such impacts. The COVID-19 pandemic could have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below, including, without limitation, those related to the success of our strategy, our ability to attract and retain customers, competition, the rate of decline for checks and business forms, our ability to reduce costs, risks of cybersecurity breaches, interruptions to our website operations or information technology systems, the ability of third-party providers to perform, and potential litigation. COVID-19-related impacts on the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are addressed under the caption: ""Note 20: Risks and Uncertainties"" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this report.STRATEGIC RISKSIf our long-term growth strategy is not successful, our business and financial results would be adversely impacted.Our vision is to be a Trusted Business Technology leader in payments and data. Further information about our strategy and its related key enablers can be found in the discussion of our ""One Deluxe"" strategy appearing in Part I, Item 1 of this report. We may not achieve our long-term objectives, and investments in our business may fail to impact our financial results as anticipated. Our strategic plan could fall short of our expectations for many reasons, including, among others:•our failure to transform to a sales-driven organization;•our failure to generate profitable revenue growth;•our inability to acquire new customers, retain our current customers and sell more products and services to current and new customers;•our failure to fully implement sales technology that enables a single view of our customers;•our inability to implement improvements to our technology infrastructure, our digital services offerings and other key assets to increase efficiency, enhance our competitive advantage and scale our operations;•our failure to develop new products and services; •our failure to effectively manage the growth, expanding complexity and pace of change of our business and operations;•our inability to effectively operate, integrate or leverage businesses we acquire;•the failure of our digital services and products to achieve widespread customer acceptance;•our inability to promote, strengthen and protect our brand;12•our failure to attract and retain skilled talent to execute our strategy and sustain our growth;•unanticipated changes in our business, markets, industry or the competitive landscape; and•general economic conditions.We can provide no assurance that our strategy will be successful, either in the short term or in the long term, that it will generate a positive return on our investment or that it will not materially reduce our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margins. If our strategy is not successful, or if there is market perception that our strategy is not successful, our reputation and brand may be damaged.If we are unable to attract and retain customers in a cost-effective manner or effectively operate a multichannel customer experience, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.Our success depends on our ability to attract new and returning customers in a cost-effective manner. We use a variety of methods to promote our products and services, including a direct sales force, partner referrals, email marketing, purchased search results from online search engines, direct mail advertising, broadcast media, advertising banners, social media and other online links. Certain of these methods may become less effective or more expensive. For example, our response rates for direct mail advertising have been decreasing for some time, internet search engines could modify their algorithms or increase prices for purchased search results or certain partner referrals could decline. We continually evaluate and modify our marketing and sales efforts to achieve the most effective mix of promotional methods. Competitive pressure may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the prices of our products and services and/or new marketing strategies may not be successful. Either of these occurrences would have an adverse impact on our ability to compete and our results of operations would be adversely affected. In addition, when our check supply contracts expire, customers have the ability to renegotiate their contracts with us or to consider changing suppliers. Failure to achieve favorable contract renewals and/or to obtain new check supply customers would result in decreased revenue.Additionally, we believe we must maintain a relevant, multichannel experience in order to attract and retain customers. Customers expect to have the ability to choose their method of ordering, whether via the mail, computer, phone or mobile device. Although we are constantly making investments to update our technology, we cannot predict the success of these investments. Multichannel marketing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with the changing expectations of our customers and new developments by our competitors. If we are unable to implement improvements to our customer-facing technology in a timely manner, or if our customer-facing technology does not function as designed, we could find it increasingly difficult to attract new and returning visitors, which would result in decreased revenue.We face intense competition from other business enterprises, and we expect that competition will continue to increase.Competition in the payments industry is intense. We are competing against numerous financial technology (Fintech) companies, as well as financial institution in-house capabilities. Volume is the key to staying cost-competitive, and breadth of services is critical to stay relevant to customers. In addition, although we are a leading check printer in the U.S., we face considerable competition in the check printing portion of the payments industry. In addition to competition from the digitization of payments, we also face intense competition from another large check printer in our traditional financial institution sales channel, from direct mail and internet-based sellers of personal and business checks, from check printing software vendors and from certain significant retailers. Pricing continues to be competitive in our financial institution sales channel, as financial institutions seek to maintain their previous levels of profitability, even as check usage declines.Within our Cloud Solutions segment, the market for web hosting services is highly competitive and commoditized. As such, significant spending on product development and customer acquisition is required to compete in this space, and value-added services differentiate the competition. The markets for our hosted software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions, including search, social and email marketing and logo design and business incorporation services, are also large, dynamic and highly competitive, with dominant integrated players, as well as niche providers. Competition for our data-driven marketing services is also intense, with a wide variety of companies in the data solutions space, including advertising agencies, marketing technology firms, data aggregators and brokers, and source data providers. Adapting to new technology is a key challenge in this business, along with hiring and retaining the right people.Within our Promotional Solutions segment, the markets for business forms and promotional products are intensely competitive and highly fragmented. Current and potential competitors include traditional storefront printing companies, office superstores, wholesale printers, online printing companies, small business product resellers and providers of custom apparel and gifts. The competitive landscape for online suppliers continues to be challenging as new internet businesses are introduced.We can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. Our competitors may develop better products or technologies and may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Continued competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and/or loss of customers, all of which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.13If we do not adapt to changes in technology in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to sustain and grow our business could be adversely affected.The markets for many of the products and services we provide are characterized by constant change and innovation. The introduction of competing products and services using new technologies, the evolution of industry standards or the introduction of more attractive products or services, including the digitization of payments, could make some or all of our products and services less desirable, or even obsolete. These potential changes are magnified by the intense competition we face. To be successful, our technology-based products and services must keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards, address the ever-changing and increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers, and achieve market acceptance. Additionally, we must differentiate our service offerings from those of our competitors and from the in-house capabilities of our customers. We could lose current and potential customers if we are unable to develop products and services that meet changing demands in a timely manner. Additionally, we must continue to develop our skills, tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies, and this requires us to incur substantial costs. Any of the foregoing risks could result in harm to our business and results of operations.We face uncertainty regarding the success and integration of past and future acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.We completed many acquisitions during the past several years. The details of our more recent acquisitions can be found under the caption “Note 6: Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this report. These acquisitions extended our range of products and services, including treasury management and web services. In addition, we purchased the operations of several small business distributors with the intention of growing revenue in our enterprise accounts and dealer channels. The integration of any acquisition involves numerous risks, including, among others:•difficulties and/or delays in assimilating operations, products and services, including effectively scaling revenue and ensuring that a strong system of information security and controls is in place;•failure to realize expected synergies and savings or to achieve projected profitability levels on a sustained basis; •diversion of management's attention from other business concerns and risks of managing an increasingly diverse set of products and services across expanded and new industries; •unanticipated integration costs; •difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies, especially when the acquired business was a non-public company and may not have employed the same rigor in these areas as required for a publicly traded company; •decisions by our customers or the customers of the acquired business to temporarily or permanently seek alternate suppliers;•difficulty in assimilating the acquired business into our corporate culture;•increased compliance and other complexity; •unidentified issues not discovered during our due diligence process, including product or service quality issues, intellectual property issues and tax or legal contingencies; •failure to address legacy distributor account protection rights; and•loss of key employees.One or more of these factors could impact our ability to successfully operate, integrate or leverage an acquisition and could negatively affect our results of operations.We have indicated that we plan to supplement sales-driven revenue growth with strategically targeted acquisitions over time. The time and expense associated with finding suitable businesses, technologies or services to acquire can be disruptive to our ongoing business and may divert management’s attention. We cannot predict whether suitable acquisition candidates can be identified or acquired on acceptable terms or whether any acquired products, technologies or businesses will contribute to our revenue or earnings to any material extent. We may need to seek financing for larger acquisitions, which would increase our debt obligations and may not be available on terms that are favorable to us. Additionally, acquisitions may result in additional contingent liabilities, additional amortization expense and/or future non-cash asset impairment charges related to acquired intangible assets and goodwill, and thus, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The use of checks and forms is declining and we may be unable to offset the decline with profitable revenue growth.Checks continue to be a significant portion of our business, accounting for 39.4% of our consolidated revenue in 2020. We sell checks for personal and business use and believe that there will continue to be demand for personal and business checks for the foreseeable future, although the total number of checks written in the U.S. has been in decline since the mid-1990s. According to the most recent information released by the Federal Reserve in October 2020, the total number of checks written declined an average of 8.4% each year between 2015 and 2018, compared to an average decline of 3.4% each year between 2012 and 2015. We expect that the number of checks written will continue to decline due to the digitization of payments, including debit cards, credit cards, direct deposit, wire transfers, and other payment solutions, such as PayPal®, Apple Pay®, Square®, Zelle® and Venmo®. In addition, the RTP® system run by The Clearing House Payments Company, LLC is a real-time payments system that currently reaches over 50% of U.S. bank accounts. In August 2019, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced that it plans to develop its own real-time payments system, FedNowSM, with an expected launch in 2023 or 2024.14The rate and the extent to which digital payments will replace checks, whether as a result of legislative developments, changing payment systems, personal preference or otherwise, cannot be predicted with certainty. Increased use of alternative payment methods, or our inability to successfully offset the secular decline in check usage with other sources of revenue, would have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows and results of operations.The use of business forms has also been declining. Continual technological improvements, including the lower price and higher performance capabilities of personal computers, printers and mobile devices, have provided small business customers with alternative means to execute and record business transactions. Additionally, electronic transaction systems, off-the-shelf business software applications, web-based solutions and mobile applications have been designed to replace preprinted business forms. Greater acceptance of electronic signatures also has contributed to the overall secular decline in printed products. It is difficult to predict the pace at which these alternative products and services will replace standardized business forms. If small business preferences change rapidly and we are unable to develop new products and services with comparable operating margins, our results of operations would be adversely affected.We may not succeed in promoting and strengthening our brand, which could prevent us from acquiring customers and increasing revenue.The success of our businesses depends on our ability to attract new and returning customers. For this reason, the promotion and strengthening of the Deluxe brand plays a key role in the execution of our strategy. We believe that the importance of brand recognition is particularly essential for the success of our various service offerings because of the level of competition for these services. Customer awareness of our brand, as well as the perceived value of our brand, depends largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high-quality customer experience. In the past, we had many brands associated with our products and services as a result of previous acquisitions. Unifying our brands to operate as one Deluxe is an essential part of our One Deluxe strategy. In February 2020, we unveiled our new Deluxe brand. We can provide no assurance that our branding strategy will be successful or will result in a positive return on our investment.To promote our brand, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, expense related to advertising and other marketing efforts. We can provide no assurance that these efforts will be successful or that our revenue will increase at a level commensurate with our marketing expenditures. There is also the risk that adverse publicity, whether or not justified, could adversely affect our business. We currently have an agreement with television personality Ty Pennington, who appears in our online series, Small Business Revolution. If Mr. Pennington, other business partners or key employees are the subject of adverse news reports or negative publicity, our reputation may be tarnished and our results of operations could be adversely affected. A component of our brand promotion strategy is building on our relationship of trust with our customers, which we believe can be achieved by providing a high-quality customer experience. We have invested, and will continue to invest, resources in website development, design and technology, and customer service and production operations. Our ability to provide a high-quality customer experience is also dependent on external factors, including the reliability and performance of our suppliers, telecommunications providers and third-party carriers. Our brand value also depends on our ability to protect and use our customers' data in a manner that meets expectations. A security incident that results in unauthorized disclosure of our customers' sensitive data could materially harm our reputation. The failure of our brand promotion activities to meet our expectations or our failure to provide a high-quality customer experience for any reason could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and maintain customer relationships, which would adversely harm our business and results of operations.Our cost reduction initiatives may not be successful.Intense competition, secular declines in the use of checks and business forms and the commoditization of web services compel us to continually improve our operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve profitability. Cost reduction initiatives have required, and will continue to require, up-front expenditures related to items such as redesigning and streamlining processes, consolidating information technology platforms, standardizing technology applications, further enhancing our strategic supplier sourcing arrangements, improving real estate utilization and funding employee severance benefits. We can provide no assurance that we will achieve future cost reductions or that we will do so without incurring unexpected or greater than anticipated expenditures. Moreover, we may find that we are unable to achieve business simplification and/or cost reduction goals without disrupting our business, negatively impacting efforts to grow our business or reducing the effectiveness of our sustainability practices. As a result, we may choose to delay or forgo certain cost reductions as business conditions require. Failure to continue to improve our operating efficiency and to generate adequate savings to fund necessary investments could adversely affect our business if we are unable to remain competitive.15OPERATIONAL RISKSSecurity breaches, computer malware or other cyber attacks involving the confidential information of our customers, employees or business partners could substantially damage our reputation, subject us to litigation and enforcement actions, and substantially harm our business and results of operations.Information security risks have increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and increased use of the internet and cloud-based activities, as well as the increased sophistication and activities of hackers, terrorists and activists. In addition, our own information security risks have increased due to the acquisition of companies with their own internally-developed technologies. We use internet-based channels that collect customers’ financial account and payment information, as well as other sensitive information, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, contractors, suppliers and business partners. Each year, we process hundreds of millions of records containing data related to individuals and businesses. We also provide services that are instrumental in supporting our customers and their businesses, such as website and email hosting. Cybersecurity is one of the top risks identified by our Enterprise Risk Management Steering Committee, as technology-based organizations such as ours are vulnerable to targeted attacks aimed at exploiting network and system application weaknesses.The secure and uninterrupted operation of our networks and systems, as well as the processing, maintenance and confidentiality of the sensitive information that resides on our systems, is critical to our business operations and strategy. We have a risk-based information/cybersecurity program dedicated to protecting our data and solutions. We employ a defensive in-depth strategy, utilizing the concept of security layers and the CIA (confidential, integrity and availability) triad model. Computer networks and the internet are, by nature, vulnerable to unauthorized access. An accidental or willful security breach could result in unauthorized access and/or use of customer information, including consumers' personally identifiable information or, in some cases, the protected health information of certain individuals. Our security measures could be breached by third-party action, computer viruses, accidents, employee or contractor error, or malfeasance by rogue employees. In addition, we depend on a number of third parties, including vendors, developers and partners, that are critical to our business and to which we may grant access to our customer or employee data. While we conduct due diligence on these third parties with respect to their security and business controls, we rely on them to effectively monitor and oversee these control measures. Individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent controls and/or exploit vulnerabilities that may exist, resulting in the disclosure or misuse of sensitive business and personal customer or employee information and data.Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage computer systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect immediately, and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities, fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving employees and contractors. We have experienced external internet-based attacks by threat actors aimed at disrupting internet traffic and/or attempting to place illegal or abusive content on our or our customers’ websites. Additionally, our customers and employees have been and will continue to be targeted by threat actors using social engineering techniques to obtain confidential information or using fraudulent ""phishing"" emails to introduce malware into the environment. To-date, these various threats have not materially impacted our customers, our business or our financial results. However, our technologies, systems and networks are likely to be the target of future attacks due to the increasing threat landscape for all technology businesses, and we can provide no assurance that future incidents will not be material.Despite our significant cybersecurity efforts, a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our or our customers' personal and proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation, all of which could deter clients and consumers from ordering our products and services and result in the termination of client contracts. Additionally, it is possible that there could be vulnerabilities that impact large segments of mobile, computer or server architecture. Any of these events would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, if we were to experience a material information security breach, we may be required to expend significant amounts of management time and financial resources to remedy, protect against or mitigate the effects of the breach, and we may not be able to remedy the situation in a timely manner, or at all. Furthermore, under payment card association rules and our contracts with debit and credit card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store or that is stored by third parties with which we do business, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and other related expenses. We could also lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, which would likely result in the loss of customers and the inability to attract new customers. We could also be exposed to time-consuming and expensive litigation, government inquiries and/or enforcement actions. If we are unsuccessful in defending a claim regarding information security breaches, we may be forced to pay damages, penalties and fines, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to compensate us fully for any losses that may occur. Contractual provisions with third parties, including cloud service providers, may limit our ability to recover losses resulting from the security breach of a business partner.There are international, federal and state laws and regulations requiring companies to notify individuals of information security breaches involving their personal data, the cost of which would negatively affect our financial results. These mandatory 16disclosures regarding an information security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity. If we were required to make such a disclosure, it may cause our clients and customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our information security measures. Likewise, general publicity regarding information security breaches at other companies could lead to the perception among the general public that e-commerce is not secure. This could decrease traffic to our websites, negatively affect our financial results and limit future business opportunities.Interruptions to our website operations or information technology systems, or failure to maintain our information technology platforms, could damage our reputation and harm our business.The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our information technology systems is critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers. We could experience temporary interruptions in our websites, transaction processing systems, network infrastructure, service technologies, printing production facilities or customer service operations for a variety of reasons, including, among others, human error, software errors or design faults, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, electrical disruptions, labor issues, vandalism, fire, flood, extreme weather, terrorism and other events beyond our control. One of the cornerstones of our growth strategy is investment in our information technology infrastructure. We are investing significant resources to build out our technology platforms. We implemented a human capital management system in January 2020. We also completed the first implementation phase of sales technology that enables a single view of our customers, and we are investing in our financial tools, including an enterprise resource planning system. System implementations are complex. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design, implementation or operation of these systems, particularly any disruptions, delays or deficiencies that impact our operations, could adversely affect our ability to effectively run and manage our business. In addition, our continued development and implementation of new generation software solutions and information technology infrastructure may take longer than originally expected and may require the acquisition of additional personnel and other resources, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any inability to deploy new generation information technology throughout our organization would result in operating multiple platforms, which would increase costs.In recent years, we shifted a substantial portion of our applications to a cloud-based environment. While we maintain redundant systems and backup databases and applications software to ensure continuous access to cloud services, it is possible that access to our software capabilities could be interrupted and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. The failure of our systems could interfere with the delivery of products and services to our customers, impede our customers' ability to do business and result in the loss or corruption of critical data. In addition to the potential loss of customers, we may be required to incur additional development costs and divert technical and other resources, and we may be the subject of negative publicity and/or liability claims. If any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our results of operations would be adversely affected, and our business interruption insurance coverage may not be adequate to compensate us fully for any losses that may occur.If third-party providers of certain significant information technology needs are unable to provide services, our business could be disrupted and the cost of such services could increase.We have entered into agreements with third-party providers for information technology services, including telecommunications, network server, cloud computing and transaction processing services. In addition, we have agreements with companies to provide services such as online payment solutions. A service provider's ability to provide services could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including, among others, human error, software errors or design faults, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, electrical disruptions, labor issues, vandalism, fire, flood, extreme weather, terrorism and other events beyond their control. In the event that one or more of our service providers is unable to provide adequate or timely information technology services, our ability to deliver products and services to our customers could be adversely affected. Although we believe we have taken reasonable steps to protect our business through contractual arrangements with our service providers, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of disruption in service. Any significant disruption could harm our business, including damage to our brand and loss of customers. Additionally, although we believe that information technology services are available from numerous sources, a failure to perform by one or more of our service providers could cause a material disruption in our business while we obtain an alternative service provider. The use of substitute third-party providers could also result in increased expense. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and other qualified employees, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.For us to successfully grow and compete, we must recruit, retain and develop the key personnel necessary to execute our growth strategy. Our success depends on the contributions and abilities of key employees, especially in our digital services businesses and specifically in sales, marketing, product management and development, data analytics and information technology. If we are unable to retain our existing employees and/or attract qualified personnel, we may not be able to grow and 17manage our business effectively. Although we have implemented various ""Great Place to Work"" initiatives, including employee wellness initiatives, the introduction of employee resource groups and a revised performance management process, we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel.The cost and availability of materials, delivery and other third-party services could adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to risks associated with the cost and availability of paper, plastics, ink, retail packaging supplies, promotional materials and other raw materials. Paper costs represent a significant portion of our materials expense. Paper is a commodity and its price has been subject to volatility due to supply and demand in the marketplace, as well as volatility in the raw material and other costs incurred by paper suppliers. There are also relatively few paper suppliers and these suppliers are under financial pressure as paper use declines. As such, when our suppliers increase paper prices, we may not be able to obtain better pricing from alternative suppliers. Historically, we have not been negatively impacted by paper shortages because of our relationships with paper suppliers. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to purchase sufficient quantities of paper if such a shortage were to occur.We depend upon third-party providers for delivery services and for other outsourced products and services. Events resulting in the inability of these service providers to perform their obligations, such as work slowdowns or extended labor strikes, could adversely impact our results of operations by requiring us to secure alternate providers at higher costs. Postal rates are dependent on the operating efficiency of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and on legislative mandates imposed upon the USPS. Postal rates have increased in recent years and the USPS has incurred significant financial losses. This may result in continued changes to the breadth and/or frequency of USPS mail delivery services. In addition, fuel costs have fluctuated over the past several years. Increased fuel costs increase the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers, as well as the price we pay for outsourced products. We also rely on third-party providers for certain technology, processing and support functions. If we are unable to renew our existing contracts with our most significant providers, we may be forced to obtain alternative suppliers at higher costs. Competitive pressures and/or contractual arrangements may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the price of our products and services. Any of the foregoing risks could result in harm to our business and results of operations.We are subject to customer payment-related risks, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.We may be liable for fraudulent transactions conducted on our websites, such as the use of stolen credit card numbers. While we do have safeguards in place, we cannot prevent all fraudulent transactions. To date, we have not incurred significant losses from payment-related fraud. However, such transactions negatively impact our results of operations and could subject us to penalties from payment card associations for inadequate fraud protection.LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKSGovernmental regulation is continuously evolving and could limit or harm our business.We are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local laws and regulations that affect our business activities in several areas, including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, taxation, data privacy and security, digital content, consumer reports, consumer protection, online payment services, real estate, e-commerce, intellectual property, health care, environmental matters, and workplace health and safety. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, local, state, national and international governments and health authorities have established myriad new laws, rules, regulations and orders. These emergency enactments evolve rapidly and sometimes become effective within a 24-hour period. The complexity of complying with existing and new laws and regulations is significant, and regulators may adopt new laws or regulations at any time.The various regulatory requirements to which we are subject could impose significant limitations on our business activities, require changes to our business, restrict our use or storage of personal information, or cause changes in our customers' purchasing behavior, which may make our business more costly and/or less efficient and may require us to modify our current or future products, services, systems or processes. We cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of such changes on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Portions of our business operate within highly regulated industries and our business results could be significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which we are subject. For example, international, federal and state laws and regulations regarding the protection of certain consumer information require us to develop, implement and maintain policies and procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of consumers' nonpublic personal information. Portions of our business are subject to regulations affecting payment processing, including ACH, remote deposit capture and lockbox services. These laws and regulations require us to develop, implement, and maintain certain policies and procedures related to payment processing. We are also subject to additional requirements in certain of our contracts with financial institution clients and communications service providers, which are often more restrictive than the regulations, as well as confidentiality clauses in certain of our contracts related to small businesses’ customer information. These regulations and agreements typically limit our ability to use or disclose nonpublic personal information for other than the purposes originally intended, which could limit business opportunities. Proposed privacy and cyber security regulations may also increase the cost of compliance for the protection of collected data. The complexity of 18compliance with these various regulations may increase our cost of doing business and may affect our clients, reducing their discretionary spending and thus, reducing their capacity to purchase our products and services.Due to our increasing use of the internet for sales and marketing, laws specifically governing digital commerce, the internet, mobile applications, search engine optimization, behavioral advertising, privacy and email marketing may have an impact on our business. Existing and future laws governing issues such as digital and social marketing, privacy, consumer protection or commercial email may limit our ability to market and provide our products and services. Changing data protection regulations may increase the cost of compliance in servicing domestic and international markets for our wholesale and retail business services channels. More restrictive legislation, such as new privacy laws, search engine marketing restrictions, “anti-spam” regulations or email privacy rules, could decrease marketing opportunities, decrease traffic to our websites and/or increase the cost of obtaining new customers.Because of additional regulatory costs, financial institutions may continue to put significant pricing pressure on their suppliers, including their check and service providers. The increase in cost and profit pressure may also lead to further consolidation of financial institutions. Additionally, some financial institutions do not permit offers of add-on services, such as bundled products, fraud/identity protection or expedited check delivery, to their customers. It would have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we were unable to market such services to consumers or small businesses through the majority of our financial institution clients. Additionally, as our product and service offerings become more technologically focused, and with expanded regulatory expectations for supervision of third-party service providers, additional portions of our business could become subject to direct federal regulation and/or examination. This would increase our cost of doing business and could slow our ability to introduce new products and services and otherwise adapt to a rapidly changing business environment.   Third-party claims could result in costly and distracting litigation and, in the event of an unfavorable outcome, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.From time to time, we are involved in claims, litigation and other proceedings relating to the conduct of our business,  including purported class action litigation. Such legal proceedings may include claims related to our employment practices; claims alleging breach of contractual obligations; claims asserting deceptive, unfair or illegal business practices; claims alleging violations of consumer protection-oriented laws; claims related to legacy distributor account protection rights; or claims related to environmental matters. In addition, third parties may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us and/or our clients, which could include aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by non-practicing entities. Any such claims could result in litigation against us and could also result in proceedings being brought against us by various federal and state agencies that regulate our businesses. The number and significance of these claims and proceedings has increased as our businesses have evolved and expanded in scope. These claims, whether successful or not, could divert management's attention, result in costly and time-consuming litigation, or both. Accruals for identified claims or lawsuits are established based on our best estimates of the probable liability. However, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and other dispute resolution mechanisms. Any unfavorable outcome of a material claim or material litigation could require the payment of monetary damages or fines, attorneys' fees or costly and undesirable changes to our products, features or business practices, which would result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may be unable to protect our rights in intellectual property, which could harm our business and ability to compete.We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret and patent protection, and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks, software and other intellectual property. These protective measures afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products or services that do not infringe on our intellectual property rights. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. We may be required to spend significant resources to protect our trade secrets and to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete.Activities of our customers or the content of their websites could damage our reputation and/or adversely affect our financial results.As a provider of domain name registration, web hosting services and customized business products, we may be subject to potential liability for the activities of our customers on or in connection with their domain names or websites, for the data they store on our servers, including information accessible through the ""dark web,"" or for images or content that we produce on their behalf. Customers may also launch distributed denial of service attacks or malicious executables, such as viruses, worms or trojan horses, from our servers. Although our agreements with our customers prohibit illegal use of our products and services and permit us to take appropriate action for such use, customers may nonetheless engage in prohibited activities or upload or store content with us in violation of applicable law. Our reputation may be negatively impacted by the actions of customers that are deemed to be hostile, offensive or inappropriate, or that infringe the copyright or trademark of another party. The safeguards we have established may not be sufficient to avoid harm to our reputation, especially if the inappropriate activities are high profile.19Laws relating to the liability of online services companies for information, such as online content disseminated through their services, are subject to frequent challenges. In spite of settled law in the U.S., claims are made against online services companies by parties who disagree with the content. Where the online content is accessed on the internet outside of the U.S., challenges may be brought under foreign laws that do not provide the same protections for online services companies as in the U.S. These challenges in either U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may give rise to legal claims alleging defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence or copyright or trademark infringement, based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through our services. Certain of our products and services include content generated by users of our online services. Although this content is not generated by us, claims of defamation or other injury may be made against us for that content. If such claims are successful, our financial results would be adversely affected. Even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, the time and resources necessary to resolve them could divert management’s attention and adversely affect our business and financial results.FINANCIAL RISKSAsset impairment charges would have a negative impact on our results of operations.Goodwill represented 39% of our total assets as of December 31, 2020. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether the carrying value of goodwill is impaired. This analysis considers several factors, including economic, market and industry conditions. Circumstances that could indicate a decline in the fair value of one or more of our reporting units include, but are not limited to, the following:•a downturn in economic conditions that negatively affects our actual and forecasted operating results;•changes in our business strategy, structure and/or the allocation of resources;•the failure of our growth strategy;•the inability of our acquisitions to achieve expected operating results;•changes in market conditions, including increased competition; •the loss of significant customers;•a decline in our stock price for a sustained period; or•a material acceleration of order volume declines for checks and business forms.Such situations may require us to record an impairment charge for a portion of goodwill. We are also required to assess the carrying value of other long-lived assets, including intangible assets and assets held for sale. Information regarding our 2020 impairment analyses can be found under the caption ""Note 8: Fair value measurements"" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We have, in the past, and may again in the future, be required to write-down the value of some of our assets, and these write-downs have been, and could in the future be, material to our results of operations. If we are required to record additional asset impairment charges for any reason, our consolidated results of operations would be adversely affected.Economic conditions, including impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, may adversely affect trends in business and consumer spending, which may adversely impact demand for our products and services.Economic conditions have affected, and will continue to affect, our results of operations and financial position. Current and future economic conditions that affect business and consumer spending, including levels of business and consumer confidence, unemployment levels, consumer spending and the availability of credit, as well as uncertainty or volatility in our customers' businesses, may adversely affect our business and results of operations. A challenging economic environment could cause existing and potential customers to not purchase or to delay purchasing our products and services, thereby negatively impacting our revenue and results of operations.A significant portion of our business relies on small business spending. We believe that small businesses are more likely to be significantly affected by economic conditions than larger, more established companies. During a sluggish economy, it may be more difficult for small businesses to obtain credit and they may choose to spend their limited funds on items other than our products and services. As such, the level of small business confidence, the rate of small business formations and closures, and the availability of credit to small businesses all impact our business.A significant portion of our business also relies upon the health of the financial services industry. As a result of global economic conditions in past years, a number of financial institutions sought additional capital, merged with other financial institutions and, in some cases, failed. The failure of one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or large portions of our customer base, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to the possibility of losing a significant client, the inability to recover prepaid product discount payments made to one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or the inability to collect accounts receivable or contractually required contract termination payments, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.20There may also be an increase in financial institution mergers and acquisitions during periods of economic uncertainty or as a result of other factors affecting the financial services industry. Such an increase could adversely affect our operating results. Often the newly combined entity seeks to reduce costs by leveraging economies of scale in purchasing, including its check supply and business services contracts. This results in providers competing intensely on price in order to retain not only their previous business with one of the financial institutions, but also to gain the business of the other party in the combined entity. Although we devote considerable effort toward the development of a competitively-priced, high-quality selection of products and services for the financial services industry, there can be no assurance that significant financial institution clients will be retained or that the impact of the loss of a significant client can be offset through the addition of new clients or by expanded sales to our remaining clients.The COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken in response to it have significantly increased economic uncertainty. The pandemic has caused a global recession and increased unemployment and we cannot predict the extent to which our customers will be able to survive such a downturn. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot predict the impact on our business, financial position or results of operations, and there is no guarantee that our efforts to address the ongoing adverse impact of the pandemic will be successful.Our variable-rate indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk.The majority of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility are subject to variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our interest expense would increase, negatively affecting earnings and reducing cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures and other investments"
16,DLX,DELUXE CORP,2020-02-21,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSOur businesses routinely encounter and address risks, many of which could cause our future results to be materially different than we currently anticipate. These risks include, but are not limited to, the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have disclosed all currently known material risks. We are also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, including overall economic, industry and market conditions. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect us. You should carefully consider all of these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock.STRATEGIC RISKSOur recently announced strategic plan to implement a new go-to-market strategy and more integrated operations, transforming us into a Trusted Business TechnologyTM company, is dependent upon our ability to successfully implement our strategic and tactical initiatives. If we are unsuccessful in implementing these initiatives in a timely manner, our financial results could be adversely affected.The strategic plan we announced during the second quarter of 2019 contemplates that our strategic and tactical initiatives will result in, among other things, sustained organic revenue growth and strong segment adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margins. We plan to achieve these results through a variety of initiatives, including greater integration of operations and technology platforms, a more streamlined sales process, more targeted cross-selling to our existing customer base, growing that customer base and reducing our cost structure. In support of these initiatives, we anticipate that we will expend significant resources on infrastructure investments to scale the business and to advance our ability to accelerate revenue growth, including investments in enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management and human resources technology.Our strategic plan could fall short of our expectations for many reasons, including, among others:•our failure to generate profitable revenue growth; •our failure to acquire new customers, retain our current customers and sell more products and services to current and new customers;•our failure to implement sales technology that enables a single view of our customers;•our inability to implement improvements to our technology infrastructure, our digital services offerings and other key assets to increase efficiency, enhance our competitive advantage and scale our operations; •our failure to effectively manage the growth, expanding complexity and pace of change of our business and operations;•our inability to effectively operate, integrate or leverage the businesses we acquire;•the failure of our digital services and products to achieve widespread customer acceptance;•our inability to promote, strengthen and protect our brand;•our failure to attract and retain skilled talent to execute our strategy and sustain our growth;•unanticipated changes in our business, markets, industry or the competitive landscape; and•general economic conditions.10We can provide no assurance that our strategic and tactical initiatives will be successful, either in the short term or in the long term, that they will generate a positive return on our investment or that they will not materially reduce our EBITDA margins. Additionally, technology system implementations entail a significant degree of inherent risk, including disruptions that may impact our operations. Any of these circumstance could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our strategic plan is not successful, or if there is market perception that our strategic plan is not successful, our reputation and brand may be damaged and our stock price may decline.Effective January 1, 2020, we realigned our existing businesses into four reportable segments: Payments, Cloud Solutions, Promotional Solutions and Checks. If this realignment is not successful, our results of operations could be adversely affected.As we previously announced, we believe that we can achieve greater operational synergies, increase organic revenue growth and reduce overall costs by realigning our existing operations and managing the company based on our product and service offerings. Effective January 1, 2020, we began managing the company to focus on 4 primary focus areas: Payments, Cloud Solutions, Promotional Solutions and Checks. We appointed general managers for each of the 4 new focus areas and we continue to refine our new organization. Realignments such as this take time, considerable senior management effort, material ""buy-in"" from employees and significant investment. Additionally, our success is dependent on our ability to establish one culture around an enterprise model focused on the customer, as well as our ability to engage our employees and to inspire them to be open to change and to innovate. Transformations of this magnitude may temporarily reduce productivity. Further, we cannot guarantee that our transformation will be successful or result in the anticipated benefits, which would adversely affect our results of operations.If we are unable to attract and retain customers in a cost-effective manner or effectively operate a multichannel customer experience, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.Our success depends on our ability to attract new and returning customers in a cost-effective manner. We use a variety of methods to promote our products and services, including a direct sales force, partner referrals, email marketing, purchased search results from online search engines, direct mail advertising, broadcast media, advertising banners, social media and other online links. Certain of these methods may become less effective or more expensive. For example, our response rates for direct mail advertising have been decreasing for some time, internet search engines could modify their algorithms or increase prices for purchased search results or certain partner referrals could decline. We continually evaluate and modify our marketing and sales efforts to achieve the most effective mix of promotional methods. Competitive pressure may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the prices of our products and services and/or new marketing strategies may not be successful. Either of these occurrences would have an adverse impact on our ability to compete and our results of operations would be adversely affected. In addition, our check supply contracts generally run for a period of 3 to 6 years. At the end of the contract term, customers have the ability to renegotiate their contracts with us or to consider changing suppliers. Failure to achieve favorable contract renewals and/or to obtain new check supply customers would result in decreased revenue.Additionally, we believe we must maintain a relevant, multichannel experience in order to attract and retain customers. Customers expect to have the ability to choose their method of ordering, whether via the mail, computer, phone or mobile device. Although we are constantly making investments to update our technology, we cannot predict the success of these investments. Multichannel marketing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with the changing expectations of our customers and new developments by our competitors. If we are unable to implement improvements to our customer-facing technology in a timely manner, or if our customer-facing technology does not function as designed, we could find it increasingly difficult to attract new and returning visitors, which would result in decreased revenue.We face intense competition from other business enterprises, and we expect that competition will continue to increase.The markets for our various service offerings are intensely competitive. Our competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. These service offerings are also rapidly evolving, creating opportunities for new competitors to enter the market. Current and potential competitors include, among others, financial institution core banking software providers, numerous financial technology service providers, advertising agencies, providers of data and analytics marketing solutions, companies offering website design and hosting and domain name registration, email and social media marketing services companies, payroll service providers and ePayments service providers. In addition, many of our potential financial institution clients have historically developed their key applications in-house and thus, we must also compete with their in-house capabilities.The market for promotional products and business forms is also intensely competitive and highly fragmented. Current and potential competitors include traditional storefront printing companies, office superstores, wholesale printers, online printing companies and small business product resellers, as well as providers of custom apparel and gifts. The competitive landscape for online suppliers continues to be challenging as new internet businesses are introduced.Although we are a leading check printer in the U.S., we face considerable competition in the check printing portion of the payments industry. In addition to competition from the digitization of payments, we also face intense competition from another large check printer in our traditional financial institution sales channel, from direct mail and internet-based sellers of personal and 11business checks, from check printing software vendors and from certain significant retailers. Pricing continues to be competitive in our financial institution sales channel, as financial institutions seek to maintain their previous levels of profitability, even as check usage declines. Although we continue to work with our large financial institution clients to renew check supply contracts for the long term, the pricing levels included in any contract renewal could be lower than our current pricing levels.We can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. Our competitors may develop better products or technologies and may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Continued competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and/or loss of customers, all of which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.We face uncertainty regarding the success and integration of recent and future acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.We completed several acquisitions during the past 3 years, the details of which appear under the caption “Note 6: Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this report. These acquisitions extended our range of products and services, including treasury management and data-driven marketing solutions and web services. In addition, over the past several years, we purchased the operations of several small business distributors with the intention of growing revenue in our enterprise accounts and dealer channels. The integration of any acquisition involves numerous risks, including, among others:•difficulties and/or delays in assimilating operations, products and services, including effectively scaling revenue and ensuring a strong system of information security and controls is in place;•failure to realize expected synergies and savings or to achieve projected profitability levels on a sustained basis; •diversion of management's attention from other business concerns and risks of managing an increasingly diverse set of products and services across expanded and new industries; •unanticipated integration costs; •difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies, especially when the acquired business was a non-public company and may not have employed the same rigor in these areas as required for a publicly traded company; •decisions by our customers or the customers of the acquired business to temporarily or permanently seek alternate suppliers;•difficulty in assimilating the acquired business into our corporate culture;•increased compliance and other complexity; •unidentified issues not discovered during our due diligence process, including product or service quality issues, intellectual property issues and tax or legal contingencies; •failure to address legacy distributor account protection rights; and•loss of key employees.One or more of these factors could impact our ability to successfully operate, integrate or leverage an acquisition and could negatively affect our results of operations.We have indicated that we plan to supplement organic revenue growth with strategically targeted acquisitions over time. The time and expense associated with finding suitable businesses, technologies or services to acquire can be disruptive to our ongoing business and may divert management’s attention. We cannot predict whether suitable acquisition candidates can be identified or acquired on acceptable terms or whether any acquired products, technologies or businesses will contribute to our revenue or earnings to any material extent. We may need to seek financing for larger acquisitions, which would increase our debt obligations and may not be available on terms that are favorable to us. Additionally, acquisitions may result in additional contingent liabilities, additional amortization expense and/or future non-cash asset impairment charges related to acquired intangible assets and goodwill, and thus, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The use of checks and forms is declining and we may be unable to offset the decline with other sources of revenue.Checks continue to be a significant portion of our business, accounting for 39.0% of our consolidated revenue in 2019. We sell checks for personal and business use and believe that there will continue to be demand for personal and business checks for the foreseeable future, although the total number of checks written in the U.S. has been in decline since the mid-1990s. According to the most recent Federal Reserve study released in December 2019, the total number of checks written declined an average of 7.5% each year between 2015 and 2018, compared to an average decline of 3.4% each year between 2012 and 2015. We expect that the number of checks written will continue to decline due to the digitization of payments, including debit cards, credit cards, direct deposit, wire transfers, and other payment solutions, such as PayPal®, Apple Pay®, Square®, Zelle® and Venmo®. In addition, the RTP® system run by The Clearing House Payments Company, LLC is a real-time payments system that currently reaches over 50% of U.S. bank accounts. In August 2019, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced that it plans to develop its own real-time payments system, with an expected launch in 2023 or 2024.The rate and the extent to which digital payments will replace checks, whether as a result of legislative developments, changing payment systems, personal preference or otherwise, cannot be predicted with certainty. Increased use of alternative 12payment methods, or our inability to successfully offset the secular decline in check usage with other sources of revenue, would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The use of business forms has also been declining. Continual technological improvements, including the lower price and higher performance capabilities of personal computers, printers and mobile devices, have provided small business customers with alternative means to execute and record business transactions. Additionally, electronic transaction systems, off-the-shelf business software applications, web-based solutions and mobile applications have been designed to replace pre-printed business forms. Greater acceptance of electronic signatures also has contributed to the overall secular decline in printed products. It is difficult to predict the pace at which these alternative products and services will replace standardized business forms. If small business preferences change rapidly and we are unable to develop new products and services with comparable operating margins, our results of operations would be adversely affected.We may not succeed in promoting and strengthening our brand, which could prevent us from acquiring customers and increasing revenue.The success of our businesses depends on our ability to attract new and returning customers. For this reason, a component of our business strategy is the promotion and strengthening of the Deluxe brand. We believe that the importance of brand recognition is particularly essential for the success of our service offerings because of the level of competition for these services. Customer awareness of our brand, as well as the perceived value of our brand, depends largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high-quality customer experience. Today, we have many brands associated with our products and services as a result of previous acquisitions. Unifying our brands to operate as one Deluxe is an essential part of our One Deluxe strategy. In February 2020, we unveiled our new Deluxe brand. Transitioning to one brand takes time and investment, and if the transition is not managed effectively, we could lose customers. We can also provide no assurance that our new branding strategy will be successful or will result in a positive return on our investment.  To promote our brand, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, expense related to advertising and other marketing efforts. We can provide no assurance that these efforts will be successful or that our revenue will increase at a level commensurate with our marketing expenditures. There is also the risk that adverse publicity, whether or not justified, could adversely affect our business. We currently have an agreement with television personality Ty Pennington, who appears in our online series, Small Business Revolution – Main Street. If Mr. Pennington, other business partners or key employees are the subject of adverse news reports or negative publicity, our reputation may be tarnished and our results of operations could be adversely affected. A component of our brand promotion strategy is building on our relationship of trust with our customers, which we believe can be achieved by providing a high-quality customer experience. We have invested, and will continue to invest, resources in website development, design and technology, and customer service and production operations. Our ability to provide a high-quality customer experience is also dependent on external factors, including the reliability and performance of our suppliers, telecommunications providers and third-party carriers. Our brand value also depends on our ability to protect and use our customers' data in a manner that meets expectations. A security incident that results in unauthorized disclosure of our customers' sensitive data could materially harm our reputation. The failure of our brand promotion activities to meet our expectations or our failure to provide a high-quality customer experience for any reason could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and maintain customer relationships, which would adversely harm our business and results of operations.If we do not adapt to changes in technology in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to sustain and grow our business could be adversely affected.The markets for many of the products and services we provide are characterized by constant change and innovation. The introduction of competing products and services using new technologies, the evolution of industry standards or the introduction of more attractive products or services, including the digitization of payments, could make some or all of our products and services less desirable, or even obsolete. These potential changes are magnified by the intense competition we face. To be successful, our technology-based products and services must keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards, address the ever-changing and increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers, and achieve market acceptance. Additionally, we must differentiate our service offerings from those of our competitors and from the in-house capabilities of our customers. We could lose current and potential customers if we are unable to develop products and services that meet changing demands in a timely manner. Additionally, we must continue to develop our skills, tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies, and this requires us to incur substantial costs. Any of the foregoing risks could result in harm to our business and results of operations.Our cost reduction initiatives may not be successful.Intense competition, secular declines in the use of checks and business forms and the commoditization of web services compel us to continually improve our operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve profitability. Additionally, we intend to utilize structural cost savings to fund a large portion of the investments required to implement our One Deluxe strategy. Cost reduction initiatives have required, and will continue to require, up-front expenditures related to items such as redesigning and streamlining processes, consolidating information technology platforms, standardizing technology applications, further enhancing 13our strategic supplier sourcing arrangements, improving real estate utilization and funding employee severance benefits. We can provide no assurance that we will achieve future cost reductions or that we will do so without incurring unexpected or greater than anticipated expenditures. Moreover, we may find that we are unable to achieve business simplification and/or cost reduction goals without disrupting our business, negatively impacting efforts to grow our business or reducing the effectiveness of our sustainability practices. As a result, we may choose to delay or forgo certain cost reductions as business conditions require. Failure to continue to improve our operating efficiency and to generate adequate savings to partially fund necessary investments, could adversely affect our business if we are unable to remain competitive.OPERATIONAL RISKSSecurity breaches, computer malware or other cyber attacks involving the confidential information of our customers, employees or business partners could substantially damage our reputation, subject us to litigation and enforcement actions, and substantially harm our business and results of operations.Information security risks have increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and increased use of the internet and cloud-based activities, as well as the increased sophistication and activities of hackers, terrorists and activists. We use internet-based channels that collect customers’ financial account and payment information, as well as other sensitive information, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, contractors, suppliers and business partners. Each year, we process hundreds of millions of records containing data related to individuals and businesses. Cybersecurity is one of the top risks identified by our Enterprise Risk Management Steering Committee, as technology-based organizations such as ours are vulnerable to targeted attacks aimed at exploiting network and system application weaknesses. The secure and uninterrupted operation of our networks and systems, as well as the processing, maintenance and confidentiality of the sensitive information that resides on our systems, is critical to our business operations and strategy. We have a risk-based cybersecurity program dedicated to protecting our data and solutions. We employ a defensive in-depth strategy, utilizing the concept of security layers and the CIA (confidential, integrity and availability) triad model. Computer networks and the internet are, by nature, vulnerable to unauthorized access. An accidental or willful security breach could result in unauthorized access and/or use of customer information, including consumers' personally identifiable information. Our security measures could be breached by third-party action, computer viruses, accidents, employee or contractor error, or malfeasance by rogue employees. In addition, we depend on a number of third parties, including vendors, developers and partners, that are critical to our business and to which we may grant access to our customer or employee data. While we conduct due diligence on these third parties with respect to their security and business controls, we rely on them to effectively monitor and oversee these control measures. Individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent these controls and/or exploit vulnerabilities that may exist, resulting in the disclosure or misuse of sensitive business and personal customer or employee information and data.Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage computer systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect immediately, and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities, fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving employees and contractors. We have experienced external internet-based attacks by threat actors aimed at disrupting internet traffic and/or attempting to place illegal or abusive content on our or our customers’ websites. Additionally, our customers and employees have been and will continue to be targeted by threat actors using social engineering techniques to obtain confidential information or using fraudulent ""phishing"" emails to introduce malware into the environment. To-date, these various threats have not materially impacted our customers, our business or our financial results. However, our technologies, systems and networks are likely to be the target of future attacks due to the increasing threat landscape for all technology businesses, and we can provide no assurance that future incidents will not be material.Despite our significant cybersecurity efforts, a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our or our customers' personal and proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation, all of which could deter clients and consumers from ordering our products and services and result in the termination of client contracts. Additionally, it is possible that there could be vulnerabilities that could impact large segments of mobile, computer or server architecture. Any of these events would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, if we were to experience a material information security breach, we may be required to expend significant amounts of management time and financial resources to remedy, protect against or mitigate the effect of the breach, and we may not be able to remedy the situation in a timely manner, or at all. Furthermore, under payment card association rules and our contracts with debit and credit card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store or that is stored by third parties with which we do business, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and other related expenses. We could also lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, which would likely result in the loss of customers and the inability to attract new customers. We could also be exposed to time-consuming and expensive litigation, government inquiries and/or enforcement actions. If we are unsuccessful in defending a claim regarding information security breaches, we may be forced to pay damages, penalties and fines, and our insurance 14coverage may not be adequate to compensate us fully for any losses that may occur. Contractual provisions with third parties, including cloud service providers, may limit our ability to recover losses resulting from the security breach of a business partner.There are international, federal and state laws and regulations requiring companies to notify individuals of information security breaches involving their personal data, the cost of which would negatively affect our financial results. These mandatory disclosures regarding an information security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity. If we were required to make such a disclosure, it may cause our clients and customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our information security measures. Likewise, general publicity regarding information security breaches at other companies could lead to the perception among the general public that e-commerce is not secure. This could decrease traffic to our websites, negatively affect our financial results and limit future business opportunities.Interruptions to our website operations or information technology systems, or failure to maintain our information technology platforms, could damage our reputation and harm our business.The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our information technology systems is critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers. We could experience temporary interruptions in our websites, transaction processing systems, network infrastructure, service technologies, printing production facilities or customer service operations for a variety of reasons, including, among others, human error, software errors or design faults, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, electrical disruptions, labor issues, vandalism, fire, flood, extreme weather, terrorism and other events beyond our control. One of the cornerstones of our growth strategy is investment in our information technology infrastructure. We are investing significant resources to build out our technology platforms, including sales technology that enables a single view of our customers, thereby providing for deeper cross-sell opportunities. We implemented a human capital management system in January 2020, and we are also investing in our financial tools, including an enterprise resource planning system and a financial planning and analysis system. System implementations are complex. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design, implementation or operation of these systems, particularly any disruptions, delays or deficiencies that impact our operations, could adversely affect our ability to effectively run and manage our business. In addition, our continued development and implementation of new generation software solutions and information technology infrastructure may take longer than originally expected and may require the acquisition of additional personnel and other resources, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any inability to deploy new generation information technology throughout our organization would result in operating multiple platforms, which would increase costs.Furthermore, as we focus resources on our growth strategy, we have reduced our investment in the development of the systems that support our check and forms businesses, with a focus on sustaining and maintaining such systems. These systems operate with minimal or no vendor support, contain hardware and software that we are not able to update and are difficult to maintain, yet any interruption caused by a failure or breach of these systems could create disruption in these businesses. In recent years, we shifted a substantial portion of our applications to a cloud-based environment. While we maintain redundant systems and backup databases and applications software to ensure continuous access to cloud services, it is possible that access to our software capabilities could be interrupted and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. The failure of our systems could interfere with the delivery of products and services to our customers, impede our customers' ability to do business and result in the loss or corruption of critical data. In addition to the potential loss of customers, we may be required to incur additional development costs and divert technical and other resources, and we may be the subject of negative publicity and/or liability claims. If any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our results of operations would be adversely affected, and our business interruption insurance coverage may not be adequate to compensate us fully for any losses that may occur.If third-party providers of certain significant information technology needs are unable to provide services, our business could be disrupted and the cost of such services could increase.We have entered into agreements with third-party providers for information technology services, including telecommunications, network server, cloud computing and transaction processing services. In addition, we have agreements with companies to provide services such as online payment solutions. A service provider's ability to provide services could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including, among others, human error, software errors or design faults, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, electrical disruptions, labor issues, vandalism, fire, flood, extreme weather, terrorism and other events beyond their control. In the event that one or more of our service providers is unable to provide adequate or timely information technology services, our ability to deliver products and services to our customers could be adversely affected. Although we believe we have taken reasonable steps to protect our business through contractual arrangements with our service providers, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of disruption in service. Any significant disruption could harm our business, including damage to our brand and loss of customers. Additionally, although we believe that information technology services are available from numerous sources, a failure to perform by one or more of our service 15providers could cause a material disruption in our business while we obtain an alternative service provider. The use of substitute third-party providers could also result in increased expense. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and other qualified employees, our business could suffer and our stock price could decline.For us to successfully grow and compete, we must recruit, retain and develop the key personnel necessary to execute our growth strategy. This is of particular importance as we realign our existing operations in support of our growth strategy. The success of this realignment and our business depends on the contributions and abilities of key employees, especially in our digital services businesses and specifically in sales, marketing, product management and development, data analytics and information technology. If we are unable to retain our existing employees and/or attract qualified personnel, we may not be able to grow and manage our business effectively. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.The cost and availability of materials, delivery and other third-party services could adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to risks associated with the cost and availability of paper, plastics, ink, retail packaging supplies, promotional materials and other raw materials. Paper costs represent a significant portion of our materials expense. Paper is a commodity and its price has been subject to volatility due to supply and demand in the marketplace, as well as volatility in the raw material and other costs incurred by our paper suppliers. There are also relatively few paper suppliers and these suppliers are under financial pressure as paper use declines. As such, when our suppliers increase paper prices, we may not be able to obtain better pricing from alternative suppliers. Historically, we have not been negatively impacted by paper shortages because of our relationships with paper suppliers. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to purchase sufficient quantities of paper if such a shortage were to occur.We depend upon third-party providers for delivery services and for other outsourced products and services. Events resulting in the inability of these service providers to perform their obligations, such as work slowdowns or extended labor strikes, could adversely impact our results of operations by requiring us to secure alternate providers at higher costs. Postal rates are dependent on the operating efficiency of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and on legislative mandates imposed upon the USPS. Postal rates have increased in recent years and the USPS has incurred significant financial losses. This may result in continued changes to the breadth and/or frequency of USPS mail delivery services. In addition, fuel costs have fluctuated over the past several years. Increased fuel costs can increase the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers, as well as the price we pay for outsourced products. We also rely on third-party providers for certain technology, processing and support functions. If we are unable to renew our existing contracts with our most significant providers, we may be forced to obtain alternative suppliers at higher costs. Competitive pressures and/or contractual arrangements may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the price of our products and services. Any of the foregoing risks could result in harm to our business and results of operations.We are subject to customer payment-related risks, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.We may be liable for fraudulent transactions conducted on our websites, such as the use of stolen credit card numbers. While we do have safeguards in place, we cannot prevent all fraudulent transactions. To date, we have not incurred significant losses from payment-related fraud. However, such transactions negatively impact our results of operations and could subject us to penalties from payment card associations for inadequate fraud protection.LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKSThird-party claims could result in costly and distracting litigation and, in the event of an unfavorable outcome, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.From time to time, we are involved in claims, litigation and other proceedings relating to the conduct of our business,  including purported class action litigation. Such legal proceedings may include claims related to our employment practices; claims alleging breach of contractual obligations; claims asserting deceptive, unfair or illegal business practices; claims alleging violations of consumer protection-oriented laws; claims related to legacy distributor account protection rights; or claims related to environmental matters. In addition, third parties may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us and/or our clients, which could include aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by non-practicing entities. Any such claims could result in litigation against us and could also result in proceedings being brought against us by various federal and state agencies that regulate our businesses. The number and significance of these claims and proceedings has increased as our businesses have evolved and expanded in scope. These claims, whether successful or not, could divert management's attention, result in costly and time-consuming litigation, or both. Accruals for identified claims or lawsuits are established based on our best estimates of the probable liability. However, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and other dispute resolution mechanisms. Any unfavorable outcome of a material claim or material litigation could require the payment of monetary damages or fines, attorneys' fees or costly and 16undesirable changes to our products, features or business practices, which would result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Governmental regulation is continuously evolving and could limit or harm our business.We are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local laws and regulations that affect our business activities in several areas, including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, taxation, data privacy and security, digital content, consumer reports, consumer protection, online payment services, real estate, e-commerce, intellectual property, health care, environmental matters, and workplace health and safety. The cost of complying with these laws and regulations is significant. In addition, regulators may adopt new laws or regulations at any time, which could trigger enforcement actions, or their interpretation of existing laws may change and/or differ from ours. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) became effective on January 1, 2020. Among other requirements, businesses subject to the CCPA are required to proactively explain privacy notices to consumers when personal information is collected and it provides California residents the right to demand that company-held personal data be shared with them or deleted. Several other states and the federal government are currently considering similar legislation.The various regulatory requirements to which we are subject could impose significant limitations on our business activities, require changes to our business, restrict our use or storage of personal information, or cause changes in our customers' purchasing behavior, which may make our business more costly and/or less efficient and may require us to modify our current or future products, services, systems or processes. We cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of such changes on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Portions of our business operate within highly regulated industries and our business results could be significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which we are subject. For example, international, federal and state laws and regulations regarding the protection of certain consumer information require us to develop, implement and maintain policies and procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of consumers' nonpublic personal information. Portions of our business are subject to regulations affecting payment processing, including ACH, remote deposit capture, and lockbox services. These laws and regulations require us to develop, implement, and maintain certain policies and procedures related to payment processing. We are also subject to additional requirements in certain of our contracts with financial institution clients and communications service providers, which are often more restrictive than the regulations, as well as confidentiality clauses in certain of our contracts related to small businesses’ customer information. These regulations and agreements typically limit our ability to use or disclose nonpublic personal information for other than the purposes originally intended, which could limit business opportunities. Proposed privacy and cyber security regulations may also increase the cost of compliance for the protection of collected data. The complexity of compliance with these various regulations may increase our cost of doing business and may affect our clients, reducing their discretionary spending and thus, reducing their capacity to purchase our products and services.Due to our increasing use of the internet for sales and marketing, laws specifically governing digital commerce, the internet, mobile applications, search engine optimization, behavioral advertising, privacy and email marketing may have an impact on our business. Existing and future laws governing issues such as digital and social marketing, privacy, consumer protection or commercial email may limit our ability to market and provide our products and services. Changing data protection regulations may increase the cost of compliance in servicing domestic and international markets for our wholesale and retail business services channels. More restrictive legislation, such as new privacy laws, search engine marketing restrictions, “anti-spam” regulations or email privacy rules, could decrease marketing opportunities, decrease traffic to our websites and/or increase the cost of obtaining new customers.Because of additional regulatory costs, financial institutions may continue to put significant pricing pressure on their suppliers, including their check and service providers. The increase in cost and profit pressure may also lead to further consolidation of financial institutions. Additionally, some financial institutions do not permit offers of add-on services, such as bundled products, fraud/identity protection, expedited check delivery or rewards programs, to their customers. It would have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we were unable to market such services to consumers or small businesses through the majority of our financial institution clients. Additionally, as our product and service offerings become more technologically focused, and with expanded regulatory expectations for supervision of third-party service providers, additional portions of our business could become subject to direct federal regulation and/or examination. This would increase our cost of doing business and could slow our ability to introduce new products and services and otherwise adapt to a rapidly changing business environment.   We may be unable to protect our rights in intellectual property, which could harm our business and ability to compete.We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret and patent protection and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks, software and other intellectual property. These protective measures afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products or services that do not infringe on our intellectual property rights. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. We may be required to spend significant resources to protect our trade secrets and to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. The loss of intellectual 17property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete.Activities of our customers or the content of their websites could damage our reputation and/or adversely affect our financial results.As a provider of domain name registration, web hosting services and customized business products, we may be subject to potential liability for the activities of our customers on or in connection with their domain names or websites, for the data they store on our servers, including information accessible through the ""dark web,"" or for images or content that we produce on their behalf. Customers may also launch distributed denial of service attacks or malicious executables, such as viruses, worms or trojan horses, from our servers. Although our agreements with our customers prohibit illegal use of our products and services and permit us to take appropriate action for such use, customers may nonetheless engage in prohibited activities or upload or store content with us in violation of applicable law. Our reputation may be negatively impacted by the actions of customers that are deemed to be hostile, offensive or inappropriate, or that infringe the copyright or trademark of another party. The safeguards we have established may not be sufficient to avoid harm to our reputation, especially if the inappropriate activities are high profile.Laws relating to the liability of online services companies for information, such as online content disseminated through their services, are subject to frequent challenges. In spite of settled law in the U.S., claims are made against online services companies by parties who disagree with the content. Where our online content is accessed on the internet outside of the U.S., challenges may be brought under foreign laws that do not provide the same protections for online services companies as in the U.S. These challenges in either U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may give rise to legal claims alleging defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence or copyright or trademark infringement, based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through our services. Certain of our products and services include content generated by users of our online services. Although this content is not generated by us, claims of defamation or other injury may be made against us for that content. If such claims are successful, our financial results would be adversely affected. Even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, the time and resources necessary to resolve them could divert management’s attention and adversely affect our business and financial results.FINANCIAL RISKSAsset impairment charges would have a negative impact on our results of operations.Goodwill represented 41% of our total assets as of December 31, 2019. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether the carrying value of goodwill is impaired. This analysis considers several factors, including economic, market and industry conditions. Circumstances that could indicate a decline in the fair value of one or more of our reporting units include, but are not limited to, the following:•changes in our business strategies, structure and/or the allocation of resources;•the failure of our acquisitions to achieve expected operating results;•changes in market conditions, including increased competition; •the loss of significant customers;•a decline in our stock price for a sustained period;•a downturn in economic conditions that negatively affects our actual and forecasted operating results; or•a material acceleration of order volume declines for checks and forms.Such situations may require us to record an impairment charge for a portion of goodwill. We are also required to assess the carrying value of other long-lived assets, including intangible assets and assets held for sale. Information regarding our 2019 impairment analyses can be found under the caption ""Note 8: Fair value measurements"" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Part II, Item 8 of this report. If we are required to record additional asset impairment charges for any reason, our consolidated results of operations would be adversely affected.Economic conditions may adversely affect trends in business and consumer spending, which may adversely impact demand for our products and services.Economic conditions have affected, and will continue to affect, our results of operations and financial position. Current and future economic conditions that affect business and consumer spending, including levels of business and consumer confidence, unemployment levels, consumer spending and the availability of credit, as well as uncertainty or volatility in our customers' businesses, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.A significant portion of our business relies on small business spending. Economic conditions have a significant impact on our small business customers. We believe that small businesses are more likely to be significantly affected by economic conditions than larger, more established companies. During a sluggish economy, it may be more difficult for small businesses to obtain credit and they may choose to spend their limited funds on items other than our products and services. As such, the level 18of small business confidence and the rate of small business formations and closures impact our business. The index of small business optimism published by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) was 102.7 in December 2019, consistent with the average index for 2019 of 103.0, but down from the average index of 106.7 reported in 2018. At the same time, the net percent of small business owners expecting general economic conditions to be better in 6 months, as published by the NFIB, held steady at 16% in December 2019, the same as in  December 2018. Additionally, consumer spending and employment levels remained strong throughout 2019. Overall, the small business economy appeared to be healthy in 2019. However, we cannot predict whether economic trends affecting small businesses will improve, stay the same or worsen in the near future.A significant portion of our business also relies upon the health of the financial services industry, including merger and acquisition activity. As a result of global economic conditions in past years, a number of financial institutions sought additional capital, merged with other financial institutions and, in some cases, failed. The failure of one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or large portions of our customer base, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to the possibility of losing a significant client, the inability to recover prepaid product discount payments made to one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or the inability to collect accounts receivable or contractually required contract termination payments, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations. There may also be an increase in financial institution mergers and acquisitions during periods of economic uncertainty or as a result of other factors affecting the financial services industry. Such an increase could adversely affect our operating results. Often the newly combined entity seeks to reduce costs by leveraging economies of scale in purchasing, including its check supply and business services contracts. This results in providers competing intensely on price in order to retain not only their previous business with one of the financial institutions, but also to gain the business of the other party in the combined entity. Although we devote considerable effort toward the development of a competitively-priced, high-quality selection of products and services for the financial services industry, there can be no assurance that significant financial institution clients will be retained or that the impact of the loss of a significant client can be offset through the addition of new clients or by expanded sales to our remaining clients.Our variable-rate indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk.The majority of the borrowings under our revolving credit facility are subject to variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our interest expense would increase, negatively affecting earnings and reducing cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions"
9,DLX,DELUXE CORP,2019-02-26,"Risk Factors
.Our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by various risks and uncertainties. These risks include, but are not limited to, the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have disclosed all known material risks. Additional risks not presently known to us, 11or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect us. You should carefully consider all of these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock.STRATEGIC RISKSWe may not be successful at implementing our growth strategies.We continue to execute strategies intended to drive sustained revenue and earnings growth, despite the continuing secular decline in check and forms usage. We are focused on increasing marketing solutions and other services revenue, particularly treasury management solutions, data-driven marketing solutions and web services, which we believe represent our most significant growth opportunities. We have invested and plan to continue investing in several key enablers to achieve our strategies, including strengthening our portfolio of products and services, particularly technology-based solutions; investing in acquisitions; scaling our service offerings; expanding our data platform capabilities; enhancing brand awareness and positioning; and improving the customer experience. In addition, we are currently evaluating our strategies and our strategic approach to all of our businesses. We can provide no assurance that any changes we may make to our strategies will be successful in the short- or long-term or will provide a positive return on our investment. Our business strategies could fall short of our expectations for many reasons, including, among others:•our failure to generate profitable revenue growth; •our failure to acquire new customers, retain our current customers and sell more products and services to current and new customers;•our inability to implement improvements to our technology and other key assets to increase efficiency, enhance our competitive advantage and scale our operations; •our failure to effectively operate, integrate or leverage the businesses we acquire;•the failure of our digital services and products to achieve widespread customer acceptance;•our inability to promote, strengthen and protect our brand;•our failure to effectively manage the growth, expanding complexity and pace of change of our business and operations;•our inability to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to complete acquisitions on acceptable terms;•unanticipated changes in our business, markets, industry or the competitive landscape; and•general economic conditions.In addition, we are focused on targeting our financial technology solutions to larger financial institutions. These offerings include data-driven marketing solutions, including outsourced marketing campaign targeting and execution; treasury management solutions; and digital engagement solutions, including loyalty and rewards programs. If we are able to increase sales of these services to larger financial institutions, we may experience fluctuations in revenue driven by our clients' marketing campaign cycles. This may adversely affect our ability to accurately predict the timing of revenues and to meet short-term expectations of operating results. In addition, we utilize pay-for-performance models for certain of our data-driven marketing offerings, meaning that our revenue is based on the success of the marketing campaign that we develop for our clients. Factors beyond our control, such as rising mortgage lending rates, could negatively impact the success of some campaigns and result in lower revenue. Rising mortgage lending rates may also result in less lending activity for our financial institution clients, which may cause them to reduce their marketing spending. In addition, by targeting our offerings to larger financial institutions, the resulting customer concentration could increase our sensitivity to any material, adverse developments affecting our significant customers, and our top customers’ purchasing power could, in some cases, give them the ability to make greater demands with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general. We can provide no assurance that our growth strategies will be successful, either in the short-term or in the long-term, that they will generate a positive return on our investment, or that they will not reduce our operating margins, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if our strategies are not successful, or if there is market perception that our strategies are not successful, our reputation and brand may be damaged and our stock price may decline.If we are unable to attract customers in a cost-effective manner or effectively develop and operate a multichannel customer experience, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.We use a variety of methods to promote our products and services, including direct mail advertising, email marketing, purchased search results from online search engines, broadcast media, advertising banners, social media and other online links. The profitability of our Direct Checks segment depends in large part on our ability to secure adequate advertising media placements at acceptable rates. We can provide no assurance regarding the future cost, effectiveness and/or availability of suitable advertising media. Additionally, our Direct Checks segment and portions of our Small Business Services segment have, at times, experienced declines in response rates related to direct mail promotional materials. While we believe that media response rates have declined across a wide variety of products and services, we believe that the declines we have experienced are also attributable to the secular decline in check usage, the gradual obsolescence of standardized forms products and the increasing use of e-commerce by both consumers and small businesses. In an attempt to offset these impacts, we continually modify our marketing and sales efforts and continue to shift a greater portion of our advertising investment to the internet. Competitive pressure may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the prices of our products and new marketing strategies 12may not be successful. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to offset a decline in response rates, even with additional marketing and sales efforts.In addition to print and email advertising, many customers come to our websites through internet search engines. If the search engines on which we rely modify their algorithms or terminate their relationship with us, fewer customers may be directed to our websites. As we analyze our overall advertising strategy, we may be forced to resort to more costly resources to replace lost internet traffic, which would adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the cost of purchased search engine listings will likely increase as demand for them continues to grow, and further cost increases could negatively affect our profitability.We also rely on referrals from financial institutions, telecommunications clients and other partners. For example, we receive small business customer referrals through our Deluxe Business Advantage® program, which provides a fast and simple way for financial institutions to offer expanded personalized service to small businesses. If these referrals were to decline, we would obtain fewer new customers and our results of operations would be negatively impacted.We believe we must maintain a relevant, multichannel experience for our customers. Customers expect to be able to order products and services from us however they please, whether via the mail, phone or computer. In particular, smart phones and tablet computing devices are increasingly being used as the primary means for accessing the internet and conducting e-commerce. Designing and purchasing custom products on mobile devices is more difficult than doing so with a traditional computer due to limited screen sizes, bandwidth and other variables. Beyond these difficulties, the development of mobile-oriented user interfaces and other technologies is complex and expensive. We are also dependent on the functionality of our systems with web browsers, mobile devices and operating systems that are controlled by third parties. These parties frequently introduce new devices, and from time to time, they may introduce new operating systems or modify existing ones.Network carriers may also impact the ability to access specified content on mobile devices. With the June 2018 effective date of the repeal of net neutrality rules, network carriers could, at their discretion, negatively impact the speeds of our websites. Network carriers could also institute paid prioritization, under which companies must pay a premium for faster internet speeds. In this situation, any additional fees could negatively affect our profitability.Although we are constantly making investments to update our technology, we cannot predict the success of these investments. Multichannel marketing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with the changing expectations of our customers and new developments by our competitors. If we are unable to implement improvements to our customer-facing technology in a timely manner, or if our customer-facing technology does not function as designed, we could find it increasingly difficult to attract new and repeat visitors to our websites and convert these visitors to customers, which would result in decreased revenue.We face intense competition in all areas of our business, and we expect that competition will continue to increase.Although we are one of the leading check printers in the United States, we face considerable competition. In addition to competition from alternative payment methods, we also face intense competition from another large check printer in our traditional financial institution sales channel, from direct mail and internet-based sellers of personal and business checks, from check printing software vendors and from some significant retailers. In addition, the suppliers of small business and financial services products and services are intensely competitive, highly fragmented and geographically dispersed. Current and potential competitors for our Small Business Services segment include traditional storefront printing companies, office superstores, companies offering website design and hosting and domain name registration, wholesale printers, online printing companies, email and social media marketing services companies, small business products and services resellers, media directory providers, and providers of custom apparel, promotional products and customized gifts. Additionally, the competitive landscape for online small business suppliers continues to be challenging as new internet businesses are introduced and traditional businesses establish an online presence. Current and potential competitors for Financial Services service offerings include financial institution core banking software providers, advertising agencies, providers of data and analytics marketing solutions, and numerous financial technology service providers offering services such as customer and account acquisition, fraud and security risk management, receivables management and treasury support services, and rewards and loyalty solutions. In addition, many of our potential financial institution clients have historically developed their key applications in-house and thus, we must compete with their in-house capacities. We offer several solutions designed to help financial institutions operate more effectively and better address the needs of their customers throughout the customer life cycle, building on our reputation as a longstanding and trusted business partner. However, our clients may continue to be reluctant to change suppliers and they may be hesitant to rely on outsourced solutions.We can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. Our competitors may develop superior products or technologies and may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Consolidation in the financial technology industry could limit our ability to complete acquisitions in this market or could force us to compete against larger companies with more services to bundle. In recent years, our revenue has benefited from price increases in all 3 of our business segments. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to increase prices in the future while remaining competitive. Pricing is becoming more competitive for product and service providers, as the internet allows customers to easily compare prices, and pricing also continues to be competitive in 13our financial institution sales channel, as financial institutions seek to maintain their previous levels of profitability, even as check usage declines. Several of our large financial institution check supply contracts are scheduled to expire in 2021 and 2022, and the pricing levels included in any contract renewals could be lower than our current pricing levels. Continued competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of customers and an increase in up-front cash payments to financial institutions upon contract execution or renewal, all of which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.We face uncertainty regarding the success of recent and future acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.We have acquired over 25 companies in the last 3 years, the details of which appear under the caption “Note 6: Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8 of this report. We have invested in acquisitions that offer marketing solutions and other services and that extend the range of products and services we offer, including treasury management, data-driven marketing solutions and web services. In addition, over the past several years, we have purchased the operations of many small business distributors with the intention of growing revenue in our enterprise accounts and dealer channels. The integration of any acquisition involves numerous risks, including, among others:•difficulties and/or delays in assimilating operations, products and services, including effectively scaling revenue and ensuring a strong system of information security and controls is in place;•failure to realize expected synergies and savings or to achieve projected profitability levels on a sustained basis; •diversion of management's attention from other business concerns and risks of managing an increasingly diverse set of products and services across expanded and new industries; •unanticipated integration costs; •difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies, especially when the acquired business was a non-public company and may not have employed the same rigor in these areas as required for a publicly traded company; •decisions by our customers or the customers of the acquired business to temporarily or permanently seek alternate suppliers;•difficulty in assimilating the acquired business into our corporate culture;•failure to address legacy distributor account protection rights;•increased compliance and other complexity; •unidentified issues not discovered during our due diligence process, including product or service quality issues, intellectual property issues and tax or legal contingencies; and•loss of key employees.One or more of these factors could impact our ability to successfully operate, integrate or leverage an acquisition and could negatively affect our results of operations.We expect to continue to invest in acquisitions, although we do not plan to complete any acquisitions during the first half of 2019 as we intend to focus on integrating our acquisitions from 2018 and working on scaling our strategy, sales and product efforts. This will temporarily slow our revenue growth, but we believe we will have a stronger and more scalable company going forward and will be better positioned to deliver new organic solutions, as well as more easily integrate future acquisitions to take advantage of our scale. The time and expense associated with finding suitable businesses, technologies or services to acquire can be disruptive to our ongoing business and may divert management’s attention. We cannot predict whether suitable acquisition candidates can be identified or acquired on acceptable terms or whether any acquired products, technologies or businesses will contribute to our revenue or earnings to any material extent. We may need to seek financing for larger acquisitions, which would increase our debt obligations and may not be available on terms that are favorable to us. Additionally, acquisitions may result in additional contingent liabilities, additional amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets and/or non-cash asset impairment charges, and thus, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The use of checks and forms is declining and we may be unable to offset the decline with other sources of revenue.Check printing continues to be a significant portion of our business. Revenue generated by the sale of checks was 40.6% of our consolidated revenue in 2018. We sell checks for personal and small business use and believe that there will continue to be demand for these checks for the foreseeable future, although the total number of checks written in the United States has been in decline since the mid-1990s. According to the most recent Federal Reserve study released in December 2016, the total number of checks written declined 4.8% each year between 2012 and 2015. We believe that the number of checks written will continue to decline due, in part, to the increasing use of alternative payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, direct deposit, wire transfers, internet-based bill paying services and digital wallet applications.In addition, steps have been taken in the development of a real-time payments system in the United States. The Federal Reserve established the Faster Payments Task Force with the objective of identifying and evaluating approaches for implementing a faster payments system. In late 2017, The Clearing House Payments Company, LLC implemented a clearing 14and settlement system allowing consumers and businesses to send and receive payments in real-time directly from their accounts at financial institutions. The National Automated Clearing House Association adopted Same-Day ACH rules to speed up the processing of ACH payments, and systems such as PayPal®, Zelle®, Venmo®, Apple Pay® and various other mobile applications allow individuals to transfer funds to other users. In addition, cryptocurrencies have been gaining acceptance in the marketplace.The rate and the extent to which alternative payment methods will achieve acceptance and replace checks, whether as a result of legislative developments, changing payment systems, personal preference or otherwise, cannot be predicted with certainty. Increased use of any of these alternative payment methods, or our inability to successfully offset the secular decline in check usage with other sources of revenue, would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The use of business forms sold by our Small Business Services segment has also been declining. Continual technological improvements, including the lower price and higher performance capabilities of personal computers, printers and mobile devices, have provided small business customers with alternative means to execute and record business transactions. Additionally, electronic transaction systems, off-the-shelf business software applications, web-based solutions and mobile applications have been designed to replace pre-printed business forms. Greater acceptance of electronic signatures also has contributed to the overall secular decline in printed products. It is difficult to predict the pace at which these alternative products and services will replace standardized business forms. If small business preferences change rapidly and we are unable to develop new products and services with comparable operating margins, our results of operations would be adversely affected.We may not succeed in promoting and strengthening our brand, which could prevent us from acquiring customers and increasing revenue.The success of our businesses depends, in part, on our ability to attract new and repeat customers. For this reason, a component of our business strategy is the promotion and strengthening of the Deluxe brand. We believe that the importance of brand recognition is essential for the success of our service offerings because of the level of competition for these services. Customer awareness of our brand, as well as the perceived value of our brand, will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high-quality customer experience. To promote our brand, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, expense related to advertising and other marketing efforts. We can provide no assurance that these efforts will be successful or that our revenue will increase at a level commensurate with our marketing expenditures. There is also the risk that negative information about Deluxe, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business. In early 2018, we entered into a partnership with television personality Ty Pennington, who appears in our online series, Small Business Revolution – Main Street. Previously, we had a partnership with Robert Herjavec of the television show Shark Tank, and his episodes of the Small Business Revolution series remain available online. If these or other business partners or key employees are the subject of adverse news reports or negative publicity, our reputation may be tarnished and our results of operations could be adversely affected. A component of our brand promotion strategy is establishing a relationship of trust with our customers, which we believe can be achieved by providing a high-quality customer experience. We have invested, and will continue to invest, resources in website development, design and technology, and customer service and production operations. Our ability to provide a high-quality customer experience is also dependent on external factors, including the reliability and performance of our suppliers, telecommunications providers and third-party carriers. If we are unable to provide a high-quality customer experience for any reason, our reputation may be harmed and our efforts to develop brand loyalty could be adversely impacted. The failure of our brand promotion activities to meet our expectations could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and maintain customer relationships, adversely harming our business and results of operations.If we do not adapt to changes in technology in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to sustain and grow our business could be adversely affected.Changes in the nature of technology solutions used by small businesses and their customers may occur rapidly. In addition, the markets for many of the services provided by our Financial Services segment are characterized by constant technological change. The introduction of competing products and services using new technologies, the evolution of industry standards or the introduction of more attractive products or services could make some or all of our products and services less desirable, or even obsolete. These potential changes are magnified by the intense competition we face. To be successful, our technology-based products and services must keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards, address the ever-changing and increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers, and achieve market acceptance. Additionally, we must differentiate our service offerings from the in-house capabilities of our customers and from those of our competitors. We could lose current and potential customers if we are unable to develop products and services that meet changing demands in a timely manner. Additionally, we must continue to develop our skills, tools and capabilities to capitalize on existing and emerging technologies, and this requires us to incur substantial costs. Any of the foregoing risks could result in harm to our business and results of operations.15Our cost reduction initiatives may not be successful.Intense competition, secular declines in the use of checks and business forms, the commoditization of web services and external factors affecting our data-driven marketing business compel us to continually improve our operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve profitability. Cost reduction initiatives have required, and will continue to require, up-front expenditures related to items such as redesigning and streamlining processes, consolidating information technology platforms, standardizing technology applications, further enhancing our strategic supplier sourcing arrangements, improving real estate utilization and funding employee severance benefits. We can provide no assurance that we will achieve future cost reductions or that we will do so without incurring unexpected or greater than anticipated expenditures. Moreover, we may find that we are unable to achieve business simplification and/or cost reduction goals without disrupting our business or negatively impacting efforts to grow our business. As a result, we may choose to delay or forgo certain cost reductions as business conditions require. Failure to continue to improve our operating efficiency could adversely affect our business if we are unable to remain competitive.OPERATIONAL RISKSSecurity breaches, computer malware or other cyber attacks involving the confidential information of our customers, employees or business partners could substantially harm our reputation and business.Information security risks have increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and increased use of the internet, as well as the increased sophistication and activities of hackers, terrorists and activists, some of which may be linked to hostile foreign governments. We use internet-based channels that collect customers’ account and credit card information, as well as other sensitive information, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, contractors, suppliers and business partners. We process hundreds of millions of records containing data related to individuals and small businesses. The secure and uninterrupted operation of our networks and systems, and of the processing and maintenance of this information, is critical to our business operations and strategy. We rely on various security procedures and systems to ensure the secure storage and transmission of information, including encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties. Computer networks and the internet are, by nature, vulnerable to unauthorized access. An accidental or willful security breach could result in unauthorized access and/or use of customer information, including consumers' personally identifiable information. Our security measures could be breached by third-party action, computer viruses, accidents, employee or contractor error, or malfeasance by rogue employees. In addition, we depend on a number of third parties, including vendors, developers and partners that are critical to our business and to which we may grant access to our customer or employee data. While we conduct due diligence on these third parties with respect to their security and business controls, individuals or third parties may be able to circumvent these controls and/or exploit vulnerabilities that may exist, resulting in the disclosure or misuse of sensitive business and personal customer or employee information and data.Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage computer systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect immediately, and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities, fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving employees and contractors. We have experienced distributed denial of service attacks by hackers aimed at disrupting internet traffic and/or attempting to place illegal or abusive content on our or our customers’ websites. Additionally, our customers and employees have been and will continue to be targeted by parties using fraudulent ""phishing"" emails to misappropriate personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through ""trojan horse"" programs to our users' computers. To-date, these various threats have not materially impacted our business or financial results. However, we can provide no assurance of a similar result in the future.Despite our significant cybersecurity efforts, a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our or our customers' personal and proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation, all of which could deter clients and consumers from ordering our products and services, and result in the termination of client contracts. Additionally, it is possible that there could be vulnerabilities that could impact large segments of mobile, computer or server architecture. Any of these events would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, if we were to experience an information security breach, we may be required to expend significant amounts of management time and financial resources to remedy, protect against, or mitigate the effect of the breach, and we may not be able to remedy the situation in a timely manner, or at all. Furthermore, under payment card association rules and our contracts with debit and credit card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that we store or that is stored by third parties with which we do business, we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and other related expenses. We could also lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, which would likely result in the loss of customers and the inability to attract new customers. We could also be exposed to time-consuming and expensive litigation, government inquiries and/or enforcement actions. If we are unsuccessful in defending a claim regarding information security breaches, we may be forced to pay damages, penalties and fines, and our insurance coverage may not be 16adequate to compensate us fully for any losses that may occur. Contractual provisions with third parties, including cloud service providers, may limit our ability to recover losses resulting from the security breach of a business partner.In addition, there are federal, state and international laws requiring companies to notify individuals of information security breaches involving their personal data, the cost of which could negatively affect our financial results. These mandatory disclosures regarding an information security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity. If we were required to make such a disclosure, it may cause our clients and customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our information security measures. Likewise, general publicity regarding information security breaches at other companies could lead to the perception among the general public that e-commerce is not secure. This could decrease traffic to our websites, negatively affect our financial results and limit future business opportunities.Interruptions to our website operations or information technology systems, or failure to maintain our information technology platform, could damage our reputation and harm our business.The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our information technology systems is critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers. We could experience temporary interruptions in our websites, transaction processing systems, network infrastructure, service technologies, printing production facilities or customer service operations for a variety of reasons, including, among others: human error, software errors, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, vandalism, fire, flood, extreme weather, terrorism, and other events beyond our control. Furthermore, as we focus resources on our growth strategies, we have reduced our investment in the development of the legacy systems that support our check and forms businesses, with a focus on sustaining and maintaining such systems. These legacy systems operate with minimal or no vendor support, contain hardware and software that we are not able to update and are difficult to maintain, yet any interruption caused by a failure or breach of these systems could create disruption in these core businesses. In addition, our technology, infrastructure and processes may contain undetected errors or design faults that may cause our websites or operating systems to fail.Over the past 3 years, we shifted a substantial portion of our applications to a private cloud-based environment. While we maintain redundant systems and backup databases and applications software to ensure continuous access to cloud services, it is possible that access to our software capabilities could be interrupted and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. The failure of our systems could interfere with the delivery of products and services to our customers, impede our customers' ability to do business and result in the loss or corruption of critical data. In addition to the potential loss of customers, we may be required to incur additional development costs and divert technical and other resources, and we may be the subject of negative publicity and/or liability claims, all of which would adversely affect our reputation and operating results. Our business interruption insurance coverage may not be adequate to compensate us fully for any losses that may occur.In addition, our continued development and implementation of new generation software solutions and information technology infrastructure may take longer than originally expected and require the acquisition of additional personnel and other resources, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any inability to deploy new generation information technology throughout our organization would result in operating multiple platforms, which would increase costs.If third-party providers of certain significant information technology needs are unable to provide services, our business could be disrupted and the cost of such services could increase.We have entered into agreements with third-party providers for information technology services, including telecommunications, network server, cloud computing and transaction processing services. In addition, we have agreements with companies to provide services such as online payment solutions. A service provider's ability to provide services could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including unauthorized access, computer viruses, accidental or intentional actions, electrical disruptions, labor issues, or other conditions. In the event that one or more of our service providers is unable to provide adequate or timely information technology services, our ability to deliver products and services to our customers could be adversely affected. Although we believe we have taken reasonable steps to protect our business through contractual arrangements with our service providers, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of disruption in service. Any significant disruption could harm our business, including damage to our brand and loss of customers. Additionally, although we believe that information technology services are available from numerous sources, a failure to perform by one or more of our service providers could cause a material disruption in our business while we obtain an alternative service provider. The use of substitute third-party providers could also result in increased expense. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and other qualified employees, our business could suffer and our stock price could decline.The success of our business depends on the contributions and abilities of key employees, especially in our digital services businesses and specifically in sales, marketing, product management, data analytics and information technology. If we are unable to retain our existing employees and/or attract qualified personnel, we may not be able to grow and manage our business effectively. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.17The cost and availability of materials, delivery services and energy could adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to risks associated with the cost and availability of paper, plastics, ink, retail packaging supplies, promotional materials, other raw materials, delivery services and energy. Paper costs represent a significant portion of our materials cost. Paper is a commodity and its price has been subject to volatility due to supply and demand in the marketplace, as well as volatility in the raw material and other costs incurred by our paper suppliers. There are also relatively few paper suppliers and these suppliers are under financial pressure as paper use declines. As such, when our suppliers increase paper prices, we may not be able to obtain better pricing from alternative suppliers. Historically, we have not been negatively impacted by paper shortages because of our relationships with paper suppliers. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to purchase sufficient quantities of paper if such a shortage were to occur.We depend upon third-party providers for delivery services and for outsourced products and services. Events resulting in the inability of these service providers to perform their obligations, such as work slowdowns or extended labor strikes, could adversely impact our results of operations by requiring us to secure alternate providers at higher costs. Postal rates are dependent on the operating efficiency of the United States Postal Service (USPS) and on legislative mandates imposed upon the USPS. Postal rates have increased in recent years and the USPS has incurred significant financial losses. This may result in changes to the breadth and/or frequency of USPS mail delivery services in the future. In addition, fuel costs have fluctuated over the past several years. Increased fuel costs can increase the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers, as well as the price we pay for outsourced products and services. Competitive pressures and/or contractual arrangements may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the price of our products. Any of the foregoing risks could result in harm to our business and results of operations.We could lose access to data sources, which could harm our ability to provide certain of our products and services. We rely on data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and non-proprietary databases, including data received from customers, strategic partners and various government and public record sources. This data includes credit and non-credit data from the national credit bureaus and other data brokers. Although we have not experienced material issues in this regard, our data sources could stop providing data, they could provide untimely data, or they could fail to adhere to our quality control standards, causing us to incur additional expense to appropriately utilize the data. In addition, our data sources could increase the cost of their data for a variety of reasons, including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use, a perception that our systems are insecure, or for competitive reasons. Any increase in the cost of obtaining data would negatively impact our profitability.If a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources were to withdraw their services, if we were to lose access to data or have our usage of data curtailed due to government regulation, if we were to lose exclusive right to the use of data, or if the collection of data were to become uneconomical, our ability to provide certain of our products and services could be negatively impacted. We can provide no assurance that we would be able to identify and contract with suitable alternative data suppliers and integrate these data sources into our product and service offerings, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.We are subject to customer payment-related risks, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.We may be liable for fraudulent transactions conducted on our websites, such as the use of stolen credit card numbers. While we do have safeguards in place, we cannot prevent all fraudulent transactions. To date, we have not incurred significant losses from payment-related fraud. However, such transactions negatively impact our results of operations and could subject us to penalties from payment card associations for inadequate fraud protection.  LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKSThird-party claims could result in costly and distracting litigation and, in the event of an unfavorable outcome, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.From time to time, we are involved in claims, litigation and other proceedings relating to the conduct of our business,  including purported class action litigation. Such legal proceedings may include claims related to our employment practices; claims alleging breach of contractual obligations; claims asserting deceptive, unfair or illegal business practices; claims alleging violations of consumer protection-oriented laws; claims related to legacy distributor account protection rights; or claims related to environmental matters. In addition, third parties may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us and/or our clients, which could include aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by non-practicing entities. Any such claims could result in litigation against us and could also result in proceedings being brought against us by various federal and state agencies that regulate our businesses. The number and significance of these claims and proceedings has increased as our businesses have evolved and expanded in scope. These claims, whether successful or not, could divert management's 18attention, result in costly and time-consuming litigation, or both. Accruals for identified claims or lawsuits are established based on our best estimates of the probable liability. However, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and other dispute resolution mechanisms. Any unfavorable outcome of a material claim or material litigation could require the payment of monetary damages or fines, attorneys' fees or costly and undesirable changes to our products, features or business practices, which would result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Governmental regulation is continuously evolving and could limit or harm our business.We are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local laws and regulations that affect our business activities in several areas including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, taxation, data privacy and security, digital content, consumer reports, consumer protection, online payment services, real estate, e-commerce, intellectual property, health care, environmental matters, and workplace health and safety. The cost of complying with these laws and regulations is significant. In addition, regulators may adopt new laws or regulations at any time, including triggering enforcement actions, or their interpretation of existing laws may change and/or differ from ours. For example, in June 2018, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) was signed into law and is effective on January 1, 2020. Among other requirements, businesses subject to the CCPA will need to proactively explain privacy notices to consumers when personal information is collected. Further amendments to the CCPA are likely and final regulations are yet to be published. We are currently assessing the impact of this law on our business activities.The various regulatory requirements to which we are subject could impose significant limitations on our business activities, require changes to our business, restrict our use or storage of personal information, or cause changes in our customers' purchasing behavior, which may make our business more costly and/or less efficient and may require us to modify our current or future products, services, systems or processes. We cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of such changes on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Portions of our business operate within highly regulated industries and our business results could be significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which we are subject. For example, federal, state and international laws and regulations regarding the protection of certain consumer information require us to develop, implement and maintain policies and procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of consumers' nonpublic personal information. Portions of our business are subject to regulations affecting payment processing, including ACH, remote deposit capture, and lockbox services. These laws and regulations require us to develop, implement, and maintain certain policies and procedures related to payment processing. We are also subject to additional requirements in certain of our contracts with financial institution clients and communications service providers, which are often more restrictive than the regulations, as well as confidentiality clauses in certain of our contracts related to small businesses’ customer information. These regulations and agreements typically limit our ability to use or disclose nonpublic personal information for other than the purposes originally intended, which could limit business opportunities. Proposed privacy and cyber security regulations may also increase the cost of compliance for the protection of collected data. The complexity of compliance with these various regulations may increase our cost of doing business and may affect our clients, reducing their discretionary spending and thus, reducing their capacity to purchase our products and services.Due to our increasing use of the internet for sales and marketing, laws specifically governing digital commerce, the internet, mobile applications, search engine optimization, behavioral advertising, privacy and email marketing may have an impact on our business. Existing and future laws governing issues such as digital and social marketing, privacy, consumer protection or commercial email may limit our ability to market and provide our products and services. Changing data protection regulations may increase the cost of compliance in servicing domestic and international markets for our wholesale and retail business services channels. More restrictive legislation, such as new privacy laws, search engine marketing restrictions, “anti-spam” regulations, or email privacy rules, could decrease marketing opportunities, decrease traffic to our websites, and/or increase the cost of obtaining new customers.Because of additional regulatory costs, financial institutions may put significant pricing pressure on their suppliers, including their check and service providers. The increase in cost and profit pressure may also lead to further consolidation of financial institutions. Additionally, some financial institutions do not permit offers of add-on services, such as bundled products, fraud/identity protection, expedited check delivery or rewards programs, to their customers. It would have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we were unable to market such services to consumers or small businesses through the majority of our financial institution clients. Additionally, as our product and service offerings become more technologically focused, and with expanded regulatory expectations for supervision of third-party service providers, additional portions of our business could become subject to direct federal regulation and/or examination. This would increase our cost of doing business and could slow our ability to introduce new products and services and otherwise adapt to a rapidly changing business environment.We are subject to environmental risks which, if realized, could have an adverse impact on our operating results. Our printing facilities are subject to many federal, state and local regulations designed to protect the environment, including those related to air emissions, wastewater discharge, waste disposal, and remediation of contaminated sites. We have sold former printing facilities to third parties and, in some instances, have agreed to indemnify the buyer of the facility for certain environmental liabilities. Unforeseen conditions at current or former facilities could result in additional liability and expense beyond our insurance coverage.19Sales and other tax collection requirements could have an adverse effect on our business. We currently collect sales, use and similar taxes in jurisdictions where our legal entities have a physical or economic presence, in accordance with landmark decisions of the United States Supreme Court and the requirements of state and local jurisdictions. In many cases, we expand the collection requirements of our acquired businesses as compared to their practices prior to acquisition, potentially increasing the cost to our customers. This may discourage them from purchasing our products and services, which would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if one or more state or local jurisdictions successfully asserts that we should have collected sales or other taxes in the past, but did not, we could incur a substantial liability for uncollected taxes. In addition, federal and state income tax laws and regulations are subject to change and could impact our consolidated results of operations and financial position.   We may be unable to protect our rights in intellectual property, which could harm our business and ability to compete.We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret and patent protection, and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks, software and other intellectual property. These protective measures afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products or services that do not infringe on our intellectual property rights. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. We may be required to spend significant resources to protect our trade secrets and to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete.Activities of our customers or the content of their websites could damage our reputation and/or adversely affect our financial results.As a provider of domain name registration, web hosting services and customized business products, we may be subject to potential liability for the activities of our customers on or in connection with their domain names or websites, for the data they store on our servers, including information accessible through the ""dark web,"" or for images or content that we produce on their behalf. Customers may also launch distributed denial of service attacks or malicious executables, such as viruses, worms or trojan horses, from our servers. Although our agreements with our customers prohibit illegal use of our products and services and permit us to take appropriate action for such use, customers may nonetheless engage in prohibited activities or upload or store content with us in violation of applicable law. Our reputation may be negatively impacted by the actions of customers that are deemed to be hostile, offensive or inappropriate, or that infringe the copyright or trademark of another party. We do not proactively monitor or review the appropriateness of customers’ use of our products and services, and we do not have control over customer activities. While we have safeguards in place, these mechanisms may not be sufficient to avoid harm to our reputation.Laws relating to the liability of online services companies for information, such as online content disseminated through their services, are subject to frequent challenges. In spite of settled law in the United States, claims are made against online services companies by parties who disagree with the content. Where our online content is accessed on the internet outside of the United States, challenges may be brought under foreign laws that do not provide the same protections for online services companies as in the United States. These challenges in either United States or foreign jurisdictions may give rise to legal claims alleging defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence, or copyright or trademark infringement, based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through our services. Certain of our products and services include content generated by users of our online services. Although this content is not generated by us, claims of defamation or other injury may be made against us for that content. If such claims are successful, our financial results would be adversely affected. Even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, the time and resources necessary to resolve them could divert management’s attention and adversely affect our business and financial results.FINANCIAL RISKSAsset impairment charges would have a negative impact on our results of operations.Goodwill represented 50% of our total assets as of December 31, 2018. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether the carrying value of goodwill is impaired. This analysis considers several factors, including economic, market and industry conditions. Circumstances that could indicate a decline in the fair value of one or more of our reporting units include, but are not limited to, the following:•changes in our business strategies and/or the allocation of resources;•the failure of our acquisitions to achieve expected operating results;•changes in market conditions; •a decline in our stock price for a sustained period;•a downturn in economic conditions that negatively affects our actual and forecasted operating results; or•a material acceleration of order volume declines for checks and forms.20Such situations may require us to record an impairment charge for a portion of goodwill. We are also required to assess the carrying value of other long-lived assets, including intangible assets and assets held for sale. Information regarding our 2018 impairment analyses can be found under the caption ""Note 8: Fair value measurements"" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8 of this report. If we are required to record additional asset impairment charges for any reason, our consolidated results of operations would be adversely affected. Certain economic conditions could have an adverse effect on operating results in each of our business segments.Certain economic conditions have affected, and will continue to affect, our results of operations and financial position. Current and future economic conditions that affect consumer and business spending, including unemployment levels, the availability of credit, and small business confidence, as well as the financial condition and growth prospects of our customers, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.A significant portion of our business relies on small business spending. As such, the level of small business confidence and the rate of small business formations and closures impact our business. We believe small businesses are more likely to be significantly affected by economic downturns than larger, more established companies. During a sluggish economy, it may be more difficult for small businesses to obtain credit and small businesses may choose to spend their limited funds on items other than our products and services. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) publishes the results of monthly surveys that provide an indication of small business owners' view of economic conditions. After record readings in the third quarter of 2018, the index of small business optimism published by the NFIB in December 2018 fell to 104.4, down slightly from 104.9 in December 2017. However, the average index was 106.7 for 2018, up from the 104.8 average in 2017. At the same time, the net percent of small business owners expecting general business conditions to be better in 6 months decreased significantly to 16% in December 2018, as compared to 33% in September 2018 and 37% in December 2017. Although these surveys showed optimism from small business owners for most of 2018, the declines in December indicate some uncertainty. We cannot predict whether small business optimism will trend positively for a sustained period of time or whether such a trend would translate into increased revenue for us.Within our personal check printing businesses, consumer spending, employment levels, and housing stock and starts impact the number of checks consumers use. We estimate that the 2018 growth rates for consumer spending and private sector employment most likely had a slightly positive impact on our personal check businesses. An increase in housing stock and starts has a positive impact on the number of checks purchased, as new households typically are in need of new checks. According to statistics released by the United States Census Bureau in December 2018, housing units completed in 2018 through November increased approximately 4% as compared to 2017. We cannot predict whether these economic trends will improve, stay the same or worsen in the near future.Mergers and acquisitions in the financial services industry may affect our results of operations. As a result of global economic conditions in past years, a number of financial institutions sought additional capital, merged with other financial institutions and, in some cases, failed. The failure of one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or large portions of our customer base, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to the possibility of losing a significant client, the inability to recover prepaid product discount payments made to one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or the inability to collect accounts receivable or contractually required contract termination payments, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations. There may also be an increase in financial institution mergers and acquisitions during periods of economic uncertainty or as a result of other factors affecting the financial services industry. Such an increase could adversely affect our operating results. Often the newly combined entity seeks to reduce costs by leveraging economies of scale in purchasing, including its check supply and business services contracts. This results in providers competing intensely on price in order to retain not only their previous business with one of the financial institutions, but also to gain the business of the other party in the combined entity. In addition, we are focused on targeting our financial technology solutions to larger financial institutions. The resulting customer concentration could increase our sensitivity to any material, adverse developments affecting our significant customers, including adverse economic conditions. Although we devote considerable effort toward the development of a competitively-priced, high-quality selection of products and services for the financial services industry, there can be no assurance that significant financial institution clients will be retained or that the impact of the loss of a significant client can be offset through the addition of new clients or by expanded sales to our remaining clients.A decline in the value of our postretirement medical plan assets and/or a significant increase in the number of participants in our postretirement medical plan could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.The fair value of our postretirement medical plan assets is subject to various risks, including credit, interest and overall market volatility risk. If the equity markets were to experience a significant decline in value, the fair value of our plan assets would decrease. This would affect the funded status of our plan and result in higher postretirement benefit expense in the future. Although our obligation is limited to funding benefits as they become payable, future declines in the fair value of our plan assets could also result in the need to contribute increased amounts of cash to fund benefits payable under the plan.21The number of participants in our postretirement medical plan could increase significantly. For the 2019 plan year, 45% of those eligible to participate in our postretirement medical plan have elected not to participate. If a significant portion of those not participating were to opt-in to our plan, our benefit obligation would increase, which would result in increased expense. Although our plan is currently overfunded, a significant increase in plan participants could require us to contribute increased amounts of cash to fund benefits payable under the plan, which would adversely affect our liquidity.Our variable-rate indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk.Borrowings under our credit facility are subject to variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our interest expense would increase, negatively affecting earnings and reducing cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions"
11,DLX,DELUXE CORP,2018-02-23,"Risk Factors
.Our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by various risks and uncertainties. These risks include, but are not limited to, the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have disclosed all known material risks. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect us. You should carefully consider all of these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock or other securities.The following important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the statements we make from time to time regarding our expected future results, including, but not limited to, forecasts regarding revenue, earnings per share, cash provided by operating activities and expected cost savings. Any forecast reflects various assumptions that are subject to significant uncertainties and, as a matter of course, may prove to be incorrect. Further, the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous factors that are beyond our control. Consequently, we caution investors that forward-looking statements are predictions based on our current expectations about future events and are not guarantees of future performance. The variation of actual results or events from such statements may be material and adverse. You are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated statements, and are encouraged to use the entire mix of historical and forward-looking information made available by us, and other information affecting us and our products and services, including the following factors.11We may not be successful at implementing our growth strategies.We continue to execute strategies intended to drive sustained revenue and earnings growth with a focus on increasing marketing solutions and other services revenue, particularly treasury management, data-driven marketing solutions and web services. We believe these revenue streams represent our most significant growth opportunity. We have invested and plan to continue investing in several key enablers to achieve our strategies, including strengthening our portfolio of products and services, particularly technology-based solutions; investing in acquisitions; attracting and retaining customers; scaling our service offerings; enhancing brand awareness and positioning; growing our major accounts and dealer networks; and improving the customer experience. Our business strategies could fall short of our expectations for many reasons, including, among others:•our failure to generate profitable revenue growth; •our failure to acquire new customers, retain our current customers and sell more products and services to current and new customers;•our inability to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to complete acquisitions on acceptable terms;•our failure to effectively operate, integrate or leverage the businesses we acquire;•the failure of our digital services and products to achieve widespread customer acceptance;•our inability to promote, strengthen and protect our brand;•our inability to implement improvements to our technology and other key assets to increase efficiency, enhance our competitive advantage and scale our operations; •our failure to effectively manage the growth, expanding complexity and pace of change of our business and operations; and•general economic conditions.In addition, we are focused on targeting our financial technology (""FinTech"") solutions to larger financial institutions. These FinTech offerings include data-driven marketing solutions, including outsourced marketing campaign targeting and execution; treasury management solutions; and digital engagement solutions, including loyalty and rewards programs. If we are able to increase sales of these services to larger financial institutions, we may experience fluctuations in revenue driven by our clients' marketing campaign cycles. This may adversely affect our ability to accurately predict the timing of revenues and to meet short-term expectations of operating results. The resulting customer concentration could also increase our sensitivity to any material, adverse developments affecting our significant customers, and our top customers’ purchasing power could, in some cases, give them the ability to make greater demands with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general.We can provide no assurance that our growth strategies will be successful either in the short-term or in the long-term, that they will generate a positive return on our investment, or that they will not reduce our operating margins. Additionally, if our strategies are not successful, or if there is market perception that our strategies are not successful, our reputation and brand may be damaged and our stock price may decline.If we are unable to attract customers in a cost-effective manner or effectively develop and operate a multichannel customer experience, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.We use a variety of methods to promote our products and services, including direct mail advertising, email marketing, purchased search results from online search engines, broadcast media, advertising banners, social media and other online links. The profitability of our Direct Checks segment depends in large part on our ability to secure adequate advertising media placements at acceptable rates. We can provide no assurance regarding the future cost, effectiveness and/or availability of suitable advertising media. Additionally, our Direct Checks segment and portions of our Small Business Services segment have, at times, experienced declines in response rates related to direct mail promotional materials. While we believe that media response rates have declined across a wide variety of products and services, we believe that the declines we have experienced are also attributable to the decline in check usage, the gradual obsolescence of standardized forms products and the increasing use of e-commerce by both consumers and small businesses. In an attempt to offset these impacts, we continually modify our marketing and sales efforts and continue to shift a greater portion of our advertising investment to the internet. Competitive pressure may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the prices of our products and new marketing strategies may not be successful. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to offset a decline in response rates, even with additional marketing and sales efforts.In addition to print and email advertising, many customers come to our websites through internet search engines. If the search engines on which we rely modify their algorithms or terminate their relationship with us, fewer customers may be directed to our websites. As we analyze our overall advertising strategy, we may be forced to resort to more costly resources to replace lost internet traffic, which would adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the cost of purchased search engine listings will likely increase as demand for them continues to grow, and further cost increases could negatively affect our profitability.We believe we must maintain a relevant, multichannel experience for our customers. Customers expect to be able to order products and services from us however they please, whether that is via the mail, land-line phone, computer, tablet or 12mobile phone. In particular, smart phones and tablet computing devices are increasingly being used as the primary means for accessing the internet and conducting e-commerce. Designing and purchasing custom products on mobile devices is more difficult than doing so with a traditional computer due to limited screen sizes, bandwidth and other variables. Beyond these difficulties, the development of mobile-oriented user interfaces and other technologies is complex and expensive. We are also dependent on the functionality of our systems with web browsers, mobile devices and operating systems that are controlled by third parties. These parties frequently introduce new devices, and from time to time they may introduce new operating systems or modify existing ones. Network carriers may also impact the ability to access specified content on mobile devices, and with the repeal of net neutrality rules in December 2017, network carriers could, at their discretion, negatively impact the speeds of our websites. In this situation, it may be necessary to pay additional fees for higher internet speeds, which could negatively affect our profitability.Although we are constantly making investments to update our technology, we cannot predict the success of these investments. Multichannel marketing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with the changing expectations of our customers and new developments by our competitors. If we are unable to implement improvements to our customer-facing technology in a timely manner, or if our customer-facing technology does not function as designed, we could find it increasingly difficult to attract new and repeat visitors to our websites and convert these visitors to customers, which would result in decreased revenue.The check printing and related products portion of the payments industry is mature, and check usage is declining.Check printing continues to be a significant portion of our business. Revenue generated by the sale of checks was 43% of our consolidated revenue in 2017. We sell checks for personal and small business use and believe that there will continue to be a substantial demand for these checks for the foreseeable future, although the total number of checks written in the United States has been in decline since the mid-1990's. According to the most recent Federal Reserve study released in December 2016, the total number of checks written declined 4.8% each year between 2012 and 2015. We believe that the number of checks written will continue to decline due to the increasing use of alternative payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, direct deposit, wire and ACH transfers, and internet-based bill paying services, as well as automated teller machines.In addition, steps have been taken in the development of a real-time payments system in the United States. The Federal Reserve established the Faster Payments Task Force with the objective of identifying and evaluating approaches for implementing a faster payments system. In late 2017, The Clearing House Payments Company, LLC (TCH) implemented a clearing and settlement system allowing consumers and businesses to send and receive payments in real-time directly from their accounts at financial institutions. The National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) adopted Same-Day ACH rules to speed up the processing of ACH payments and systems such as Zelle®, Venmo®, Apple Pay® and various other mobile applications allow individuals to transfer funds to other users. In addition, cryptocurrencies have been gaining acceptance in the marketplace.The rate and the extent to which alternative payment methods will achieve acceptance and replace checks, whether as a result of legislative developments, changing payment systems, personal preference or otherwise, cannot be predicted with certainty. A surge in the popularity of any of these alternative payment methods, or our inability to successfully offset the decline in check usage with other sources of revenue, would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Small Business Services' standardized business forms and related products face technological obsolescence and changing customer preferences.Revenue generated by the sale of business forms was 11% of our consolidated revenue in 2017. Continual technological improvements have provided small business customers with alternative means to execute and record business transactions. For example, because of the lower price and higher performance capabilities of personal computers, printers and mobile devices, small businesses now have alternate means to print many business forms. Additionally, electronic transaction systems, off-the-shelf business software applications, web-based solutions and mobile applications have been designed to replace pre-printed business forms. Greater acceptance of electronic signatures also contributes to the overall decline in printed products. It is difficult to predict the pace at which these alternative products and services will achieve widespread acceptance and replace standardized business forms. If small business preferences change rapidly and we are unable to develop new products and services with comparable operating margins, our results of operations would be adversely affected.We face intense competition in all areas of our business, and we expect that competition will continue to increase.Although we are one of the leading check printers in the United States, we face considerable competition. In addition to competition from alternative payment methods, we also face intense competition from another large check printer in our traditional financial institution sales channel, from direct mail and internet-based sellers of personal and business checks, from check printing software vendors and from some retailers. In addition, the suppliers of small business and financial services products and services are intensely competitive, highly fragmented and geographically dispersed. Current and potential competitors for our Small Business Services segment include traditional storefront printing companies; office superstores; companies offering website design and hosting and domain name registration; wholesale printers; online printing companies; email and social media marketing services companies; small business products and services resellers; media directory providers; and offline and online suppliers of custom apparel, promotional products and customized gifts. Additionally, the 13competitive landscape for online small business suppliers continues to be challenging as new internet businesses are introduced and traditional businesses establish an online presence. Current and potential competitors for Financial Services service offerings include financial institution core banking software providers, advertising agencies, providers of data and analytics marketing solutions, and numerous FinTech service providers offering services such as customer and account acquisition, fraud and security risk management, receivables management and treasury support services, and rewards and loyalty solutions. In addition, many of our potential financial institution clients have historically developed their key applications in-house and thus, we must compete with their in-house capacities. For financial institutions, switching from one vendor to another can be a significant undertaking, with some potential clients perceiving disadvantages such as loss of accustomed functionality, conversion costs and business disruption. Through our ongoing efforts to expand well beyond our legacy check-related products, we strive to overcome this resistance to changing vendors. We offer several solutions designed to help financial institutions operate more effectively and better address the needs of their customers throughout the customer life cycle, building on our reputation as a longstanding and trusted partner of financial institutions. However, our clients may continue to be reluctant to change suppliers and they may be hesitant to rely on outsourced solutions. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. In recent years, our revenue has benefited from price increases in all 3 of our business segments. Pricing is becoming more competitive for product and service providers, as the internet allows customers to easily compare prices. Pricing also continues to be competitive in our financial institution sales channel, as financial institutions seek to maintain their previous levels of profitability, even as check usage declines. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to increase prices in the future while remaining competitive. Continued competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of customers and an increase in up-front cash payments to financial institutions upon contract execution or renewal, all of which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.Security breaches, computer malware or other cyber attacks involving the confidential information of our customers, employees or business partners could substantially harm our reputation and business.Information security risks have increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and increased use of the internet, as well as the increased sophistication and activities of hackers, terrorists and activists, some of which may be linked to hostile nation-state actors. We use internet-based channels that collect customers’ account and credit card information, as well as other sensitive information, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, contractors, suppliers and business partners. We process hundreds of millions of records containing data related to individuals and small businesses. The secure and uninterrupted operation of our networks and systems, and of the processing and maintenance of this information, is critical to our business operations and strategy. We rely on various security procedures and systems to ensure the secure storage and transmission of information, including encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties. Computer networks and the internet are, by nature, vulnerable to unauthorized access. An accidental or willful security breach could result in unauthorized access and/or use of customer information, including consumers' personally identifiable information. Our security measures could be breached by third-party action, computer viruses, accidents, employee or contractor error, or malfeasance by rogue employees. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage computer systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect immediately, and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities, fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving employees and contractors. We have experienced distributed denial of service attacks by hackers aimed at disrupting internet traffic and/or attempting to place illegal or abusive content on our or our customers’ websites. Additionally, our customers and employees have been and will continue to be targeted by parties using fraudulent ""phishing"" emails to misappropriate personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through ""trojan horse"" programs to our users' computers. To-date, these various threats have not materially impacted our business or financial results. However, we can provide no assurance of a similar result in the future.Although we invest in a system of information security and controls, a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our or our customers' personal and proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation, all of which could deter clients and consumers from ordering our products and services, and result in the termination of client contracts. Additionally, it is possible that there could be vulnerabilities that could impact large segments of mobile, computer or server architecture. Any of these events would adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, if we were to experience an information security breach, we may be required to expend significant amounts to remedy, protect against, or mitigate the effect of the breach, and we may not be able to remedy the situation in a timely manner, or at all. We could also be exposed to time-consuming and expensive litigation, government inquiries and/or enforcement actions. If we are unsuccessful in defending a lawsuit regarding information security breaches, we may be forced to pay damages, penalties and fines, any of which would have an adverse effect on our financial results.In addition, there are federal, state and international laws requiring companies to notify individuals of information security breaches involving their personal data, the cost of which could negatively affect our financial results. These mandatory disclosures regarding an information security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity. If we were required to make 14such a disclosure, it may cause our clients and customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our information security measures. Likewise, general publicity regarding information security breaches at other companies could lead to the perception among the general public that e-commerce is not secure. This could decrease traffic to our websites, negatively affect our financial results and limit future business opportunities.Interruptions to our website operations or information technology systems, or failure to maintain our information technology platform, could damage our reputation and harm our business.The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our information technology systems is critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers. We could experience temporary interruptions in our websites, transaction processing systems, network infrastructure, service technologies, printing production facilities or customer service operations for a variety of reasons, including, among others: human error, software errors, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, vandalism, fire, flood, extreme weather, terrorism, and other events beyond our control. Furthermore, as we focus resources on our growth strategies, we have reduced our investment in the development of our legacy systems that support our checks and forms businesses, with a focus on sustaining and maintaining such systems. These legacy systems operate with minimal or no vendor support, contain hardware and software that we are not able to update and are difficult to maintain, yet any interruption caused by a failure or breach of these systems could create disruption in the core businesses that generate a declining portion of our revenue. In addition, our technology, infrastructure and processes may contain undetected errors or design faults that may cause our websites or operating systems to fail. Over the past two years, we shifted a substantial portion of our applications to a private cloud-based environment. While we maintain redundant systems and backup databases and applications software to ensure continuous access to cloud services, it is possible that access to our software capabilities could be interrupted and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. The failure of our systems could interfere with the delivery of products and services to our customers, impede our customers' ability to do business and result in the loss or corruption of critical data. In addition to the potential loss of customers, we may be required to incur additional development costs and divert technical and other resources, and we may be the subject of negative publicity and/or liability claims, all of which would adversely affect our reputation and operating results.In addition, our continued development and implementation of new generation software solutions and information technology infrastructure may take longer than originally expected and require the acquisition of additional personnel and other resources, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any inability to deploy new generation information technology throughout our organization would result in our operating multiple platforms, which would increase costs.We face uncertainty regarding the success of recent and future acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.We have acquired over 25 companies in the last 3 years, the details of which appear under the caption “Note 5: Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8 of this report. We have invested in acquisitions that offer marketing solutions and other services and that extend the range of products and services we offer to financial institutions and small businesses, including treasury management and data-driven marketing solutions. In addition, over the past several years, we have purchased the operations of many small business distributors with the intention of growing revenue in our major accounts and dealer channels. The integration of any acquisition involves numerous risks, including, among others:•difficulties and/or delays in assimilating operations, products and services, including effectively scaling revenue and ensuring a strong system of information security and controls is in place;•failure to realize expected synergies and savings or to achieve projected profitability levels on a sustained basis; •diversion of management's attention from other business concerns and risks of managing an increasingly diverse set of products and services across expanded and new industries; •unanticipated integration costs; •difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies, especially when the acquired business was a non-public company and may not have employed the same rigor in these areas as required for a publicly traded company; •decisions by our customers or the customers of the acquired business to temporarily or permanently seek alternate suppliers;•difficulty in assimilating the acquired business into our corporate culture;•failure to address legacy distributor account protection rights;•unidentified issues not discovered during our due diligence process, including product or service quality issues, intellectual property issues and tax or legal contingencies; and•loss of key employees.One or more of these factors could impact our ability to successfully operate, integrate or leverage an acquisition and could negatively affect our results of operations.We expect to continue to invest in acquisitions. The time and expense associated with finding suitable businesses, technologies or services to acquire can be disruptive to our ongoing business and may divert management’s attention. We 15cannot predict whether suitable acquisition candidates can be acquired on acceptable terms or whether any acquired products, technologies or businesses will contribute to our revenue or earnings to any material extent. We may need to seek financing for larger acquisitions, which would increase our debt obligations and may not be available on terms that are favorable to us. Additionally, significant acquisitions typically result in additional contingent liabilities and/or additional amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, and thus, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may not succeed in promoting and strengthening our brand, which could prevent us from acquiring customers and increasing revenue.The success of our businesses depends, in part, on our ability to attract new and repeat customers. For this reason, a component of our business strategy is the promotion and strengthening of the Deluxe brand. We believe that the importance of brand recognition is essential for the success of our service offerings because of the level of competition for these services. Customer awareness of our brand, as well as the perceived value of our brand, will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality customer experience. To promote our brand, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, expense related to advertising and other marketing efforts. We can provide no assurance that these efforts will be successful or that our revenue will increase at a level commensurate with our marketing expenditures. There is also the risk that negative information about Deluxe, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business. In early 2018, we entered into a partnership with television personality Ty Pennington, who will appear in our online series, Small Business Revolution – Main Street. Previously, we had a partnership with Robert Herjavec of the television show Shark Tank, and his episodes of the Small Business Revolution series remain available online. If our business partners are the subject of adverse news reports or negative publicity, such events could reduce the effectiveness of our partnerships, which in turn, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. A component of our brand promotion strategy is establishing a relationship of trust with our customers, which we believe can be achieved by providing a high-quality customer experience. We have invested, and will continue to invest, resources in website development, design and technology, and customer service and production operations. Our ability to provide a high-quality customer experience is also dependent on external factors including the reliability and performance of our suppliers, telecommunications providers and third-party carriers. If we are unable to provide a high-quality customer experience for any reason, our reputation may be harmed and our efforts to develop brand loyalty could be adversely impacted. The failure of our brand promotion activities to meet our expectations could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and maintain customer relationships, adversely harming our business and results of operations.If we do not adapt to changes in technology in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to sustain and grow our business could be adversely affected.Changes in the nature of technology solutions used by small businesses and their customers may occur rapidly. In addition, the markets for many of the services provided by our Financial Services segment are characterized by constant technological changes. The introduction of competing products and services using new technologies, the evolution of industry standards or the introduction of more attractive products or services could make some or all of our products and services less desirable, or even obsolete. These potential changes are magnified by the intense competition we face. To be successful, our technology-based products and services must keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards, address the ever-changing and increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers, and achieve market acceptance. We could lose current and potential customers if we are unable to develop products and services that meet these changing demands in a timely manner. Additionally, our operating results could be adversely affected if we are required to incur substantial costs to keep pace with technological advances.If third-party providers of certain significant information technology needs are unable to provide services, our business could be disrupted and the cost of such services could increase.We have entered into agreements with third-party providers for information technology services, including telecommunications, network server, cloud computing and transaction processing services. In addition, we have agreements with companies to provide services such as online payment solutions. A service provider's ability to provide services could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including unauthorized access, computer viruses, accidental or intentional actions, electrical disruptions, or other conditions. In the event that one or more of our service providers is unable to provide adequate or timely information technology services, our ability to deliver products and services to our customers could be adversely affected. Although we believe we have taken reasonable steps to protect our business through contractual arrangements with our service providers, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of disruption in service. Any significant disruption could harm our business, including damage to our brand and loss of customers. Additionally, although we believe that information technology services are available from numerous sources, a failure to perform by one or more of our service providers could cause a material disruption in our business while we obtain an alternative source of supply. The use of substitute third-party providers could also result in increased expense.16Asset impairment charges would have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations.Goodwill and an indefinite-lived trade name represented 52% of our total assets as of December 31, 2017. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether the carrying value of these assets is impaired. This analysis considers factors including, but not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions. Circumstances that could indicate a decline in the fair value of one or more of our reporting units include, but are not limited to, the following:•a decline in our stock price for a sustained period;•a downturn in economic conditions that negatively affects our actual and forecasted operating results;•a material acceleration of order volume declines for our Direct Checks segment; •the failure of recent acquisitions to achieve expected operating results; or•changes in our business strategies.Such situations may require us to record an impairment charge for a portion of goodwill and/or our indefinite-lived trade name. For example, during 2017, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $28.4 million related to our Small Business Services Safeguard reporting unit. The impairment analysis of this reporting unit, which incorporated the results of the annual strategic planning process, indicated lowered projected long-term revenue growth and profitability levels resulting from changes in market trends and the mix of products and services sold, including the continuing decline in checks and forms. We are also required to assess the carrying value of other long-lived assets, including amortizable intangibles and assets held for sale. If we were required to record additional asset impairment charges for any reason, our consolidated results of operations would be adversely affected. Our variable-rate indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk and our credit facility matures in February 2019.Borrowings under our credit facility are subject to variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our interest expense would increase, negatively affecting earnings and reducing cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions.Our credit facility matures in February 2019. As such, we will need to repay, refinance, replace or otherwise extend the maturity of our credit facility. Our ability to do so will be dependent on, among other things, business conditions, our financial performance and the general condition of the financial markets. If a financial disruption were to occur at the time that we are required to repay, refinance or replace indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility, we could be forced to undertake alternate financings under current market terms, negotiate for an extension of the maturity of the credit facility or sell assets and delay capital expenditures in order to generate proceeds that could be used to repay our indebtedness. We can provide no assurance that the terms of any new debt agreements will be as favorable as those under our current credit facility, which would negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow.Governmental regulation is continuously evolving and could limit or harm our business.We are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local laws and regulations that affect our business activities in areas including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, taxation, data privacy and security, digital content, consumer reports, consumer protection, online payment services, real estate, e-commerce, intellectual property, health care, environmental matters, and workplace health and safety. The cost of complying with these laws and regulations is significant. In addition, regulators may adopt new laws or regulations at any time, including triggering enforcement actions, or their interpretation of existing laws may change and/or differ from ours. These various regulatory requirements could impose significant limitations on our business activities, require changes to our business, restrict our use or storage of personal information, or cause changes in our customers' purchasing behavior which may make our business more costly and/or less efficient and may require us to modify our current or future products, services, systems or processes. We cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of such changes on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.Portions of our business operate within highly regulated industries and our business results could be significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which we are subject. For example, federal, state and international laws and regulations regarding the protection of certain consumer information require us to develop, implement and maintain policies and procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of consumers' nonpublic personal information. Portions of our business are subject to regulations affecting payment processing, including ACH, remote deposit capture, and lockbox services. These laws and regulations require us to develop, implement, and maintain certain policies and procedures related to payment processing. We are also subject to additional requirements in certain of our contracts with financial institution clients and communications service providers, which are often more restrictive than the regulations, as well as confidentiality clauses in certain of our contracts related to small businesses’ customer information. These regulations and agreements typically limit our ability to use or disclose nonpublic personal information for other than the purposes originally intended, which could limit business opportunities. Proposed cyber security regulations may also increase the cost of compliance for the protection of nonpublic personal information. The complexity of compliance with these various regulations may increase our cost of doing business and may affect our financial institution clients, reducing their discretionary spending and thus, reducing their capacity to purchase our products and services.17Due to our increasing use of the internet for sales and marketing, laws specifically governing digital commerce, the internet, mobile applications, search engine optimization, behavioral advertising and email marketing may have an impact on our business. Existing and future laws governing issues such as net neutrality, digital and social marketing, privacy, consumer protection or commercial email may limit our ability to market and provide our products and services. Changing data protection regulations may increase the cost of compliance in servicing international markets for our wholesale and retail business services channels. More restrictive legislation, such as new privacy laws, search engine marketing restrictions, “anti-spam” regulations, or email privacy rules, could decrease marketing opportunities, decrease traffic to our websites, and/or increase the cost of obtaining new customers.Because of additional regulatory costs, financial institutions may put significant pricing pressure on their suppliers, including their check and service providers. The increase in cost and profit pressure may also lead to further consolidation of financial institutions. Additionally, some financial institutions are wary of offering add-on services, such as bundled products, fraud/identity protection, expedited check delivery or rewards programs, to their customers. It would have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we were unable to market such services to consumers or small businesses through our financial institution clients. Additionally, as our product and service offerings become more technologically focused, and with expanded regulatory expectations for supervision of third-party service providers, additional portions of our business could become subject to direct federal regulation and/or examination. This would increase our cost of doing business and could slow our ability to introduce new products and services and otherwise adapt to a rapidly changing business environment.We are subject to environmental risks which, if realized, could have an adverse impact on our operating results. Our printing facilities are subject to many federal, state and local regulations designed to protect the environment, including those related to air emissions, wastewater discharge, waste disposal, and remediation of contaminated sites. We have sold former printing facilities to third parties and, in some instances, have agreed to indemnify the buyer of the facility for certain environmental liabilities. Unforeseen conditions at current or former facilities could result in additional liability and expense beyond our insurance coverage.Sales and other tax collection requirements could have an adverse effect on our business. We currently collect sales, use and similar taxes in jurisdictions where our legal entities have a physical presence, in accordance with landmark decisions of the United States Supreme Court. States and local jurisdictions have begun enacting legislation requiring collection beyond our current practices. This potential increased cost to our customers may discourage them from purchasing our products and services, which would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if one or more state or local jurisdictions successfully asserts that we should have collected sales or other taxes in the past, but did not, we could incur a substantial liability for uncollected taxes. In addition, federal and state income tax laws and regulations are subject to change and could impact our consolidated results of operations and financial position. Federal tax reform legislation, which was enacted in December 2017 as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Act), resulted in a reduction in our 2017 income tax expense of approximately $20.5 million. We expect that our annual effective income tax rate for 2018 will be approximately 25% and we expect that our total tax payments in 2018 will be approximately $25.0 million less than in 2017, driven primarily by the 2017 Act.   Economic conditions could have an adverse effect on operating results in each of our business segments.Economic conditions have affected, and will continue to affect, our results of operations and financial position. Current and future economic conditions that affect consumer and business spending, including unemployment levels, the availability of credit, and small business confidence, as well as the financial condition and growth prospects of our customers, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.A significant portion of our business relies on small business spending. As such, the level of small business confidence and the rate of small business formations and closures impact our business. We believe small businesses are more likely to be significantly affected by economic downturns than larger, more established companies. During a sluggish economy, it may be more difficult for small businesses to obtain credit and small businesses may choose to spend their limited funds on items other than our products and services. The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) publishes the results of monthly surveys that provide an indication of small business owners' view of economic conditions. The index of small business optimism published by the NFIB in December 2017 was 104.9, down slightly from 105.8 in December 2016. For 2017, the average index was 104.8, up significantly from the 96.3 average in 2016. At the same time, the net percent of small business owners expecting general business conditions to be better in 6 months declined to 37% in December 2017, as compared to 50% in December 2016. Although there continues to be some optimism from small business owners, including some belief that they will benefit from federal tax reform under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we cannot predict whether sustainable positive trends will translate into economic growth. Within our personal check printing businesses, consumer spending, employment levels, and housing stock and starts impact the number of checks consumers use. We estimate that the 2017 growth rates for consumer spending and private sector employment most likely had a neutral impact on our personal check businesses. An increase in housing stock and starts has a positive impact on the number of checks purchased, as new households typically are in need of new checks. According to statistics released by the United States Census Bureau in January 2018, housing units completed during 2017 increased almost 9% as compared to 2016. We cannot predict whether these economic trends will improve, stay the same or worsen in the near future.18As a result of global economic conditions in recent years, a number of financial institutions sought additional capital, merged with other financial institutions and, in some cases, failed. This turmoil in the financial services industry affected and may continue to affect our results of operations. The failure of one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or large portions of our customer base, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to the possibility of losing a significant client, the inability to recover contract acquisition payments made to one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or the inability to collect accounts receivable or contractually required contract termination payments, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations. There may also be an increase in financial institution mergers and acquisitions during periods of economic uncertainty. Such an increase could adversely affect our operating results. Often the newly combined entity seeks to reduce costs by leveraging economies of scale in purchasing, including its check supply and business services contracts. This results in providers competing intensely on price in order to retain not only their previous business with one of the financial institutions, but also to gain the business of the other party in the merger/acquisition. In addition, we are focused on targeting our FinTech solutions to larger financial institutions. The resulting customer concentration could increase our sensitivity to any material, adverse developments affecting our significant customers, including adverse economic conditions. Although we devote considerable effort toward the development of a competitively-priced, high-quality selection of products and services for the financial services industry, there can be no assurance that significant financial institution clients will be retained or that the impact of the loss of a significant client can be offset through the addition of new clients or by expanded sales to our remaining clients.A deterioration in financial markets and/or in general business conditions in 2018 would negatively affect our operating results. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and other qualified employees, our business could suffer.The success of our business depends on the contributions and abilities of key employees, especially in our digital services businesses and specifically in sales, marketing, product management, data analytics and information technology. If we are unable to retain our existing employees and/or attract qualified personnel, we may not be able to grow and manage our business effectively. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.The cost and availability of materials, delivery services and energy could adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to risks associated with the cost and availability of paper, plastics, ink, retail packaging supplies, promotional materials, other raw materials, delivery services and energy. Paper costs represent a significant portion of our materials cost. Paper is a commodity and its price has been subject to volatility due to supply and demand in the marketplace, as well as volatility in the raw material and other costs incurred by our paper suppliers. There are also relatively few paper suppliers and these suppliers are under financial pressure as paper use declines. As such, when our suppliers increase paper prices, we may not be able to obtain better pricing from alternative suppliers. Historically, we have not been negatively impacted by paper shortages because of our relationships with paper suppliers. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to purchase sufficient quantities of paper if such a shortage were to occur.We depend upon third-party providers for delivery services and for outsourced products and services. Events resulting in the inability of these service providers to perform their obligations, such as work slowdowns or extended labor strikes, could adversely impact our results of operations by requiring us to secure alternate providers at higher costs. Postal rates are dependent on the operating efficiency of the United States Postal Service (USPS) and on legislative mandates imposed upon the USPS. Postal rates have increased in recent years and the USPS has incurred significant financial losses. This may result in changes to the breadth and/or frequency of USPS mail delivery services in the future. In addition, fuel costs have fluctuated over the past several years. Increased fuel costs can increase the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers, as well as the price we pay for outsourced products and services. Competitive pressures and/or contractual arrangements may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the price of our products.The failure to reduce costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Intense competition, declines in the use of checks and business forms, the commoditization of web services, and sluggish economic conditions compel us to continually improve our operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve profitability. We have significantly reduced costs over the past several years, primarily within sales, marketing, service fulfillment and operational support, as well as our shared services functions, including product fulfillment, information technology, real estate, finance and human resources. We realized net cost reductions of approximately $45.0 million in 2017, as compared to our 2016 results of operations, and we will continue to explore ways to simplify our business processes and reduce our cost and expense structure. Cost reduction initiatives have required and will continue to require up-front expenditures related to items such as redesigning and streamlining processes, consolidating information technology platforms, standardizing technology applications, further enhancing our strategic supplier sourcing arrangements, improving real estate utilization and funding employee severance benefits. We can provide no assurance that we will achieve future cost reductions or that we will do so without incurring unexpected or greater than anticipated expenditures. Moreover, we may find that we are unable to achieve business simplification and/or cost reduction goals without disrupting our business and, as a result, may choose to delay or forgo certain cost reductions as business conditions require. Failure to continue to improve our operating efficiency could adversely affect our business if we are unable to remain competitive.19We could lose access to data sources which could harm our ability to provide certain of our products and services. We rely upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and non-proprietary databases, including data received from customers, strategic partners and various government and public record sources. This data includes credit and non-credit data from the national credit bureaus and other data brokers. Although we have not experienced material issues in this regard, our data sources could stop providing data, they could provide untimely data, or they could fail to adhere to our quality control standards, causing us to incur additional expense to appropriately utilize the data. In addition, our data sources could increase the costs of their data for a variety of reasons, including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use, a perception that our systems are insecure, or for competitive reasons. If a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources were to withdraw their services, if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation, if we were to lose exclusive right to the use of data, or if the collection of data were to become uneconomical, our ability to provide our products and services could be negatively impacted. We can provide no assurance that we would be able to identify and contract with suitable alternative data suppliers and integrate these data sources into our product and service offerings.Third-party claims could result in costly and distracting litigation, and in the event of an unfavorable outcome, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.From time to time, we are involved in claims, litigation and other proceedings relating to the conduct of our business,  including purported class action litigation. Such legal proceedings may include claims related to our employment practices; claims alleging breach of contractual obligations; claims asserting deceptive, unfair or illegal business practices; or claims alleging violations of consumer protection-oriented laws. In addition, third parties may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us and/or our clients, which could include aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by non-practicing entities. Any such claims could result in litigation against us and could also result in proceedings being brought against us by various federal and state agencies that regulate our business. The number and significance of these claims and proceedings has increased as our businesses have evolved and expanded in scope. These claims, whether successful or not, could divert management's attention, result in costly and time-consuming litigation, or both. Accruals for identified claims or lawsuits are established based on our best estimates of our probable liability. However, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and other dispute resolution mechanisms. Any unfavorable outcome of a material claim or material litigation could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to customer payment-related risks, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.We accept payments for our products and services on our websites by a variety of methods, including credit and debit cards, checks and wire transfers. For debit and credit cards, we pay interchange and other fees that may increase over time. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules and requirements, including Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, a set of security standards designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment. These rules and requirements have changed over time and could change in the future or be reinterpreted to make it more costly, more difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules and requirements, we may be subject to fines and/or higher transaction fees. Any changes could increase our cost of compliance, which would negatively affect our financial results. We could also lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, which would likely result in the loss of customers and the inability to attract new customers.In addition, we may be liable for fraudulent transactions conducted on our websites, such as the use of stolen credit card numbers. While we do have safeguards in place, we cannot prevent all fraudulent transactions. To date, we have not incurred significant losses from payment-related fraud. However, such transactions negatively impact our results of operations and could subject us to penalties from payment card associations for inadequate fraud protection.  We may be unable to protect our rights in intellectual property, which could harm our business and ability to compete.We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret and patent protection, and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks, software and other intellectual property. These protective measures afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products or services that do not infringe on our intellectual property rights. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. We may be required to spend significant resources to protect our trade secrets and to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete.20A decline in the value of our postretirement medical plan assets and/or a significant increase in the number of participants in our postretirement medical plan could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.The fair value of our postretirement medical plan assets is subject to various risks, including credit, interest and overall market volatility risk. If the equity markets were to experience a significant decline in value, the fair value of our plan assets would decrease. This would affect the funded status of our plan and result in higher postretirement benefit expense in the future. Although our obligation is limited to funding benefits as they become payable, future declines in the fair value of our plan assets could also result in the need to contribute increased amounts of cash to fund benefits payable under the plan.The number of participants in our postretirement medical plan could increase significantly. For the 2018 plan year, 43.8% of those eligible to participate in our postretirement medical plan have elected not to participate. If a significant portion of those not participating were to opt-in to our plan, our benefit obligation would increase, which would result in increased expense. Although our plan is currently overfunded, a significant increase in plan participants could also require us to contribute increased amounts of cash to fund benefits payable under the plan"
8,DLX,DELUXE CORP,2017-02-24,"Risk Factors
.Our business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by various risks and uncertainties. These risks include, but are not limited to, the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have disclosed all known material risks. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. You should carefully consider all of these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock or other securities.The following important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the statements we make from time to time regarding our expected future results, including, but not limited to, forecasts regarding revenue, marketing solutions and other services revenue, earnings per share, cash provided by operating activities and expected cost savings. Any forecast reflects various assumptions that are subject to significant uncertainties and, as a matter of course, may prove to be incorrect. Further, the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous factors that are beyond our control. Consequently, we caution investors that forward-looking statements are predictions based on our current expectations about future events and are not guarantees of future performance. The variation of actual results or events from such statements may be material and adverse. You are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated statements, and are encouraged to use the entire mix of historical and forward-looking information made available by us, and other information affecting us and our products and services, including the following factors.We may not be successful at implementing our growth strategies.We continue to execute strategies intended to drive sustained revenue and earnings growth, including our focus on increasing marketing solutions and other services revenue, which we believe represents our most significant revenue growth opportunity. We have invested and plan to continue investing in several key enablers to achieve our strategies, including strengthening our portfolio of products and services, including technology-based solutions: enhancing brand awareness and positioning; attracting and retaining customers; growing our major accounts and dealer networks; improving the customer experience; and investing in small to medium-sized acquisitions. Our business strategies could fall short of our expectations for many reasons, including, among others:•our failure to generate profitable revenue growth; •our failure to acquire new customers, retain our current customers and sell more products and services to current and new customers;•our failure to effectively operate, integrate or leverage the businesses we acquire;•the failure of our digital services and products to achieve widespread customer acceptance;•our inability to promote, strengthen and protect our brand;•our inability to implement improvements to our technology in a timely manner; •our failure to effectively manage growth, including enhancements to our operational, financial and management capabilities and controls and our reporting systems and procedures; and•a continued challenging economic environment.In addition, we are focused on targeting our suite of financial technology (""FinTech"") solutions to larger financial institutions. These FinTech offerings include data-driven marketing solutions, including outsourced marketing campaign targeting and execution; treasury management solutions; and digital enablement solutions, including loyalty and rewards programs. If we are able to increase sales of these services to larger financial institutions, the resulting customer concentration could increase the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material, adverse developments experienced by our significant customers. In addition, our top customers’ purchasing power could, in some cases, give them the ability to make greater demands with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general.We can provide no assurance that our growth strategies will be successful either in the short-term or in the long-term, that they will generate a positive return on our investment, or that they will not reduce our operating margins. Additionally, if our strategies are not successful, or if there is market perception that our strategies are not successful, our reputation and brand may be damaged and our stock price may decline.If we are unable to attract customers in a cost effective manner, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.We use a variety of methods to promote our products and services, including direct mail advertising, email marketing, purchased search results from online search engines, broadcast media, advertising banners, social media and other online links. The profitability of our Direct Checks segment depends in large part on our ability to secure adequate advertising media placements at acceptable rates. We can provide no assurance regarding the future cost, effectiveness and/or availability of suitable advertising media. Additionally, our Direct Checks segment and portions of our Small Business Services segment have, at times, experienced declines in response rates related to direct mail promotional materials. While we believe that media response rates have declined across a wide variety of products and services, we believe that the declines we have experienced are also attributable to the decline in check usage, the gradual obsolescence of standardized forms products and the increasing 12use of e-commerce by both consumers and small businesses. In an attempt to offset these impacts, we continually modify our marketing and sales efforts and continue to shift a greater portion of our advertising investment to the internet. Competitive pressure may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the prices of our products and new marketing strategies may not be successful. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to offset a decline in response rates, even with additional marketing and sales efforts.In addition to print and email advertising, many customers come to our websites through internet search engines. If the search engines on which we rely modify their algorithms or terminate their relationship with us, fewer customers may be directed to our websites. As we analyze our overall advertising strategy, we may be forced to resort to more costly resources to replace lost internet traffic, which would adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the cost of purchased search engine listings will likely increase as demand for them continues to grow, and further cost increases could negatively affect our profitability.We believe we must maintain a relevant, multichannel experience for our customers. Customers expect to be able to order products and services from us however they please, whether that is via the mail, land-line phone, computer, tablet or mobile phone. In particular, the use of smart phones and tablet computing devices has been increasing significantly. The Internet Trends Report published in June 2015 by Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers (KPBC) indicated that mobile devices are now used more than desktops and laptops to access the internet. As current and potential customers increase their use of mobile devices, visits to our websites via traditional computers may decline. Designing and purchasing custom products on mobile devices is more difficult than doing so with a traditional computer due to limited screen sizes and bandwidth. Beyond these difficulties, the development of mobile-oriented user interfaces and other technologies is complex and expensive. We are also dependent on the functionality of our systems with web browsers, mobile devices and operating systems that are controlled by third parties. These parties frequently introduce new devices, and from time to time they may introduce new operating systems or modify existing ones. Network carriers may also impact the ability to access specified content on mobile devices. Although we are constantly making investments to update our technology, we cannot predict the success of these investments. Multichannel marketing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with the changing expectations of our customers and new developments by our competitors. If we are unable to implement improvements to our customer-facing technology in a timely manner, or if our customer-facing technology does not function as designed, we could find it increasingly difficult to attract new and repeat visitors to our websites and convert these visitors to customers, which would result in decreased revenue.The check printing and related products portion of the payments industry is mature, and check usage is declining.Check printing continues to be an essential part of our business. Revenue generated by the sale of checks was 46.8% of our consolidated revenue in 2016. We sell checks for personal and small business use and believe that there will continue to be a substantial demand for these checks for the foreseeable future, although the total number of checks written in the United States has been in decline since the mid-1990's. According to the most recent Federal Reserve study released in December 2016, the total number of checks written declined 4.8% each year between 2012 and 2015. We believe that the number of checks written will continue to decline due to the increasing use of alternative payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, direct deposit, wire and ACH transfers, and internet-based bill paying services, as well as automated teller machines, which make cash a more readily available alternative.In addition, steps have been taken in the development of a real-time payments system in the United States. The Federal Reserve established the Faster Payments Task Force with the objective of identifying and evaluating approaches for implementing a faster payments system and is encouraging the private sector to create real-time payment solutions. In April 2016, FIS, a FinTech company, and The Clearing House Payments Company, LLC announced plans to run a nation-wide real-time payments system pilot during the first quarter of 2017. Also, a number of financial institutions are members of Early Warning's clearXchange® network and/or ZelleSM, which enable their customers to send or receive real-time person-to-person payments to or from customers of participating network banks, and person-to-person digital wallet services such as Venmo® allow individuals to transfer funds to other users. While we cannot predict the impact real-time payment systems will have on check usage, nor the speed at which such systems will become prevalent in the United States, a related study commissioned by the Federal Reserve from McKinsey & Company concluded that check usage could be reduced by one-third if a real-time payments system were to become widely available in the United States.The rate and the extent to which alternative payment methods will achieve acceptance and replace checks, whether as a result of legislative developments, changing payment systems, personal preference or otherwise, cannot be predicted with certainty. A surge in the popularity of any of these alternative payment methods, or our inability to successfully offset the decline in check usage with other sources of revenue, would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Small Business Services' standardized business forms and related products face technological obsolescence and changing customer preferences.Revenue generated by the sale of business forms was 11.6% of our consolidated revenue in 2016. Continual technological improvements have provided small business customers with alternative means to execute and record business transactions. For example, because of the lower price and higher performance capabilities of personal computers, printers and mobile devices, small businesses now have alternate means to print many business forms. Additionally, electronic transaction 13systems, off-the-shelf business software applications, web-based solutions and mobile applications have been designed to replace pre-printed business forms. It is difficult to predict the pace at which these alternative products and services will  achieve widespread acceptance and replace standardized business forms. If small business preferences change rapidly and we are unable to develop new products and services with comparable operating margins, our results of operations would be adversely affected.We face intense competition in all areas of our business, and we expect that competition will continue to increase.Although we are one of the leading check printers in the United States, we face considerable competition. In addition to competition from alternative payment methods, we also face intense competition from another large check printer in our traditional financial institution sales channel, from direct mail and internet-based sellers of personal and business checks, from check printing software vendors and from some retailers. In addition, the markets for small business and financial services products and services are intensely competitive, highly fragmented and geographically dispersed. Current and potential Small Business Services competitors include traditional storefront printing companies; office superstores; companies offering website design and hosting and domain name registration; wholesale printers; online printing companies; email and social media marketing services companies; small business products and services resellers; media directory providers; and offline and online suppliers of custom apparel, promotional products and customized gifts. Additionally, the competitive landscape for e-commerce continues to be challenging as new internet businesses are introduced and traditional businesses establish an online presence. Current and potential competitors for Financial Services service offerings include financial institution core banking software providers, advertising agencies, providers of data and analytics marketing solutions, and numerous financial technology services providers offering services such as customer and account acquisition, fraud and security risk management, receivable management and treasury support services, and rewards and loyalty solutions. In addition, many of our potential financial institution clients have historically developed their key applications in-house and thus, we must compete with their in-house capacities. For financial institutions, switching from one vendor to another is a significant undertaking, with some potential clients perceiving disadvantages such as loss of accustomed functionality, conversion costs and business disruption. Through our ongoing efforts to expand well beyond our legacy check-related products, we strive to overcome this resistance to changing vendors. We offer several solutions designed to help financial institutions operate more effectively and better address the needs of their customers throughout the customer life cycle, building on our reputation as a longstanding and trusted partner of financial institutions.We can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. In recent years, our revenue has benefited from price increases in all three of our business segments. Pricing is becoming more competitive for small business product and service providers, as the internet allows customers to easily compare prices. Pricing also continues to be competitive in our financial institution sales channel, as financial institutions seek to maintain their previous levels of profitability, even as check usage declines. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to increase prices in the future while remaining competitive. Continued competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of customers and brand recognition, and an increase in up-front cash payments to financial institutions upon contract execution or renewal, all of which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.Security breaches, computer malware or other cyber attacks involving the confidential information of our customers, employees or business partners, or the perception that e-commerce is not secure, could substantially harm our reputation and business.Information security risks have increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and increased use of the internet, as well as the increased sophistication and activities of hackers, terrorists and activists, some of which may be linked to hostile foreign governments. We use internet-based channels that collect customers’ account and credit card information, as well as other sensitive information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers, employees and suppliers. We process hundreds of millions of records containing data related to individuals and small businesses. The secure and uninterrupted operation of our networks and systems, and of the processing and maintenance of this information, is critical to our business operations and strategy. We rely on various security procedures and systems to ensure the secure storage and transmission of information, including encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties. Computer networks and the internet are, by nature, vulnerable to unauthorized access. An accidental or willful security breach could result in unauthorized access and/or use of customer information, including consumers' nonpublic personal information. Our security measures could be breached by third-party action, computer viruses, accidents, or error or malfeasance by an employee or contractor. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage computer systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect immediately, and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities, fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving employees, contractors and temporary staff. We have encountered threats of this type from time to time, and while to-date, such threats have not materially impacted our business or financial results, we can provide no assurance of a similar result in the future.Although we continue to invest in a system of information security and controls, a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our or our customers' proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation, all of which could deter clients and 14consumers from ordering our products and services, and result in the termination of client contracts. Any of these events would adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, if we were to experience an information security breach, we may be required to expend significant amounts to remedy, protect against, or mitigate the effect of the breach, and we may not be able to remedy the situation in a timely manner, or at all. We could also be exposed to time-consuming and expensive litigation, government inquiries and/or enforcement actions. If we are unsuccessful in defending a lawsuit regarding information security breaches, we may be forced to pay damages, penalties and fines, any of which would have an adverse effect on our financial results.In addition, there are federal, state and foreign laws requiring companies to notify individuals of information security breaches involving their personal data, the cost of which could negatively affect our financial results. These mandatory disclosures regarding an information security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity. If we were required to make such a disclosure, it may cause our clients and customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our information security measures. Likewise, general publicity regarding information security breaches at other companies could lead to the perception among the general public that e-commerce is not secure. This could decrease traffic to our websites, negatively affect our financial results and limit future business opportunities.Interruptions to our website operations or information technology systems, or failure to maintain our information technology platform, could damage our reputation and harm our business.The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our information technology systems is critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers. We could experience temporary interruptions in our websites, transaction processing systems, network infrastructure, service technologies, printing production facilities or customer service operations for a variety of reasons, including, among others: human error, software errors, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, vandalism, fire, flood, extreme weather, terrorism, and other events beyond our control. In addition, our technology, infrastructure and processes may contain undetected errors or design faults that may cause our websites or operating systems to fail, and certain of our operating systems are unsupported. Our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. During 2016, we shifted a large portion of our applications to a private cloud-based environment, with the intention to eventually shift a substantial portion of our applications to this environment. While we maintain redundant systems and backup databases and applications software to ensure continuous access to cloud services, it is possible that access to our software capabilities could be interrupted. The failure of our systems could interfere with the delivery of products and services to our customers, impede our customers' ability to do business and result in the loss or corruption of critical data. In addition to the potential loss of customers, we may be required to incur additional development costs and divert technical and other resources, and we may be the subject of negative publicity and/or liability claims, all of which would adversely affect our reputation and operating results.In addition, our continued development and implementation of new generation software solutions and information technology infrastructure may take longer than originally expected and require the acquisition of additional personnel and other resources, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any inability to deploy new generation information technology throughout our organization would result in our operating multiple platforms, which would increase costs.We face uncertainty regarding the success of recent and future acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.We have acquired several companies in recent years, the details of which appear under the caption “Note 5: Acquisitions” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8 of this report. We have invested in acquisitions that offer marketing solutions and other services and that extend the range of products and services we offer to financial institutions and small businesses. In addition, over the past several years, we have purchased the operations of several small business distributors with the intention of growing revenue in our major accounts and dealer channels. The integration of any acquisition involves numerous risks, including, among others:•difficulties and/or delays in assimilating operations, products and services, as well as ensuring that a strong system of information security and controls is in place; •failure to realize expected synergies and savings; •diversion of management's attention from other business concerns and risks of managing an increasingly diverse set of products and services across expanded and new industries; •decisions by our customers or the customers of the acquired business to temporarily or permanently seek alternate suppliers;•failure to address legacy distributor account protection rights;•difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies; •unidentified issues not discovered during our due diligence process, including product or service quality issues, intellectual property issues and tax or legal contingencies; and•potential loss of key employees.15One or more of these factors could impact our ability to successfully operate, integrate or leverage an acquisition and could negatively affect our results of operations.We expect to continue to invest in small to medium-sized acquisitions. The time and expense associated with finding suitable businesses, technologies, or services to acquire can be disruptive to our ongoing business and may divert management’s attention. We cannot predict whether suitable acquisition candidates can be acquired on acceptable terms or whether any acquired products, technologies or businesses will contribute to our revenue or earnings to any material extent. We may need to seek financing for larger acquisitions, which would increase our debt obligations and may not be available on terms that are favorable to us. Additionally, significant acquisitions typically result in additional contingent liabilities and/or additional amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, and thus, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may not succeed in promoting and strengthening our brand, which could prevent us from acquiring customers and increasing revenue.The success of Small Business Services depends, in part, on our ability to attract new and repeat customers. For this reason, a component of our business strategy is the promotion and strengthening of the Deluxe brand. We believe that the importance of brand recognition is essential for the success of our service offerings because of the level of competition for these services. Customer awareness of our brand, as well as the perceived value of our brand, will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality customer experience. To promote our brand, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, expense related to advertising and other marketing efforts. We can provide no assurance that these efforts will be successful. There is also the risk that negative information about Deluxe, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business. During 2015, we entered into a partnership with Robert Herjavec of the television show Shark Tank, which offers us the opportunity to provide marketing support to the businesses in which he invests. If Mr. Herjavec were to become the subject of adverse news reports or negative publicity, such events could reduce the effectiveness of our partnership, which in turn, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. A component of our brand promotion strategy is establishing a relationship of trust with our customers, which we believe can be achieved by providing a high-quality customer experience. We have invested, and will continue to invest, resources in website development, design and technology, and customer service and production operations. Our ability to provide a high-quality customer experience is also dependent on external factors including the reliability and performance of our suppliers, telecommunications providers and third-party carriers. If we are unable to provide a high-quality customer experience for any reason, our reputation may be harmed and our efforts to develop brand loyalty could be adversely impacted. The failure of our brand promotion activities to meet our expectations could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and maintain customer relationships, adversely harming our business and results of operations.If we do not adapt to changes in technology in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to sustain and grow our business could be adversely affected.Changes in the nature of technology solutions used by small businesses and their customers may occur rapidly. In addition, the markets for many of the services provided by our Financial Services segment are characterized by constant technological changes. The introduction of competing products and services using new technologies, the evolution of industry standards or the introduction of more attractive products or services could make some or all of our products and services less desirable, or even obsolete. These potential changes are magnified by the intense competition we face. To be successful, our technology-based products and services must keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards, address the ever-changing and increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers, and achieve market acceptance. We could lose current and potential customers if we are unable to develop products and services that meet these changing demands in a timely manner. Additionally, our operating results could be adversely affected if we are required to incur substantial costs to keep pace with technological advances.If third-party providers of certain significant information technology needs are unable to provide services, our business could be disrupted and the cost of such services could increase.We have entered into agreements with third-party providers for information technology services, including telecommunications, network server and transaction processing services. In addition, we have agreements with companies to provide services such as on-line payment solutions. A service provider's ability to provide services could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including unauthorized access, computer viruses, accidental or intentional actions, electrical disruptions, or other conditions. In the event that one or more of our service providers is unable to provide adequate or timely information technology services, our ability to deliver products and services to our customers could be adversely affected. Although we believe we have taken adequate steps to protect our business through contractual arrangements with our service providers, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of disruption in service. Any significant disruption could harm our business, including damage to our brand and loss of customers. Additionally, although we believe that information technology services are available from numerous sources, a failure to perform by one or more of our service providers could cause a disruption in our business while we obtain an alternative source of supply. The use of substitute third-party providers could also result in increased expense.16Governmental regulation is continuously evolving and could limit or harm our business.We are subject to numerous international, federal, state and local laws and regulations that affect our business activities in areas including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, taxation, data privacy and security, digital content, consumer reports, consumer protection, online payment services, real estate, e-commerce, intellectual property, health care, environmental matters, and workplace health and safety. The cost of complying with these laws and regulations is significant. In addition, regulators may adopt new laws or regulations at any time, including triggering enforcement actions, or their interpretation of existing laws may change and/or differ from ours. These various regulatory requirements could impose significant limitations on our business activities, require changes to our business, restrict our use or storage of personal information, or cause changes in our customers' purchasing behavior which may make our business more costly and/or less efficient and may require us to modify our current or future products, services, systems or processes. We cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of such changes on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.Portions of our business are subject to regulations implementing the privacy and information security requirements of the federal financial modernization law known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, as well as the consumer reporting obligations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and other federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the protection of certain consumer information. These laws and regulations require us to develop, implement and maintain policies and procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of consumers' nonpublic personal information.  Portions of our business are subject to regulations affecting payments including ACH, remote deposit capture, and lockbox services. These laws and regulations require us to develop, implement, and maintain policies and procedures related to payments processing. We are also subject to additional requirements in certain of our contracts with financial institution clients and communications service providers, which are often more restrictive than the regulations, as well as confidentiality clauses in certain of our contracts related to small businesses’ customer information. These regulations and agreements typically limit our ability to use or disclose nonpublic personal information for other than the purposes originally intended, which could limit business opportunities. Proposed cyber security regulations may increase the costs of compliance for the protection of nonpublic personal information. The complexity of compliance with regulations may also increase our cost of doing business. It may also affect our financial institution clients, reducing their discretionary spending and thus, possibly reducing the amount they spend on our products and services.Due to our increasing use of the internet for sales and marketing, laws specifically governing digital commerce, the internet, mobile applications, search engine optimization, behavioral advertising and email marketing may have an impact on our business. Existing and future laws governing issues such as digital and social marketing, privacy, consumer protection or commercial email may limit our ability to market and provide our products and services. Changing data protection regulations may increase the costs of compliance in servicing international markets for our wholesale and retail business services channels. More restrictive legislation, such as new privacy laws, search engine marketing restrictions, “anti-spam” regulations, or email privacy rules, could decrease marketing opportunities, decrease traffic to our websites, and/or increase the cost of obtaining new customers.The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ""Act"") and related guidance from regulators continues to increase the complexity of consumer protection rules for financial institutions and introduces more restrictive selling practices and more stringent regulatory capital requirements for financial institutions. Because of the additional costs, financial institutions may put significant pricing pressure on their suppliers, including their check and service providers. The increase in cost and profit pressure may also lead to further consolidation of financial institutions. Additionally, the Act gave the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) the authority to pursue financial institutions engaged in unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. The CFPB’s rule-making and enforcement power may also extend to financial institutions’ service providers, based on the type of financial product or service being provided. This has made some financial institutions wary of offering add-on services, such as bundled products, fraud/identity protection, expedited check delivery or rewards programs, to their customers. It would have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we were unable to market such services to consumers or small businesses through our financial institution clients. Additionally, as our product and service offerings become more technologically focused, and with expanded regulatory expectations for supervision of third-party service providers, additional portions of our business could become subject to direct federal regulation and/or examination. This would increase our cost of doing business and could slow our ability to introduce new products and services and otherwise adapt to a rapidly changing business environment.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued final rules mandated by the Act regarding disclosure of the use of tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold, known as conflict minerals, in products manufactured by public companies. These rules require a reasonable country of origin inquiry to determine whether such minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. Accordingly, we implemented a reasonable country of origin inquiry program in order to complete the conflict minerals disclosures required in our Form SD filings with the SEC. There are costs associated with complying with these rules and the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products could be adversely affected. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict-free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origin of all conflict minerals used in our products.17We are subject to environmental risks which, if realized, could have an adverse impact on our operating results. Our printing facilities are subject to many federal, state and local regulations designed to protect the environment, including those related to air emissions, wastewater discharge, waste disposal, and remediation of contaminated sites. We have sold former printing facilities to third parties and, in some instances, have agreed to indemnify the buyer of the facility for certain environmental liabilities. Unforeseen conditions at current or former facilities could result in additional liability and expense beyond our insurance coverage. The effects of human activity on global climate change have attracted considerable public and scientific attention, as well as the attention of the United States government. Regulation or some form of legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is currently being considered in the United States. Even in the absence of such legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency, spurred by judicial interpretation of the Clean Air Act, may regulate GHG emissions, Government regulation to limit carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions as a result of concern over climate change could result in increased compliance costs and other financial obligations, which would adversely affect our operating results.Sales and other tax collection requirements could have an adverse effect on our business. We currently collect sales, use and similar taxes in jurisdictions where our legal entities have a physical presence, in accordance with landmark decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court. States and local jurisdictions have begun enacting legislation requiring collection beyond our current practices. This potential increased cost to our customers may discourage them from purchasing our products and services, which would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if one or more state or local jurisdictions successfully asserts that we should have collected sales or other taxes in the past, but did not, we could incur a substantial liability for uncollected taxes. In addition, federal and state income tax laws and regulations are subject to change and could have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position.   Economic conditions could have an adverse effect on operating results in each of our business segments.Economic conditions have affected, and will continue to affect, our results of operations and financial position. Current and future economic conditions that affect consumer and business spending, including unemployment levels, the availability of credit, and small business confidence, as well as the financial condition and growth prospects of our customers, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.A significant portion of our business relies on small business spending. As such, the level of small business confidence and the rate of small business formations and closures impact our business. In recent years, below average small business optimism, as well as declines in small business formations and increases in small business closures, negatively impacted our results of operations and/or our growth opportunities in Small Business Services. We believe small businesses are more likely to be significantly affected by economic downturns than larger, more established companies. During a sluggish economy, it may be more difficult for small businesses to obtain credit and small businesses may choose to spend their limited funds on items other than our products and services. Within our personal check printing businesses, consumer spending, employment levels, and housing stock and starts impact the number of checks consumers use. We estimate that the 2016 growth rates for consumer spending and private sector employment most likely had a slightly negative impact on our personal check businesses. An increase in housing stock and starts has a positive impact on the number of checks purchased, as new households typically are in need of new checks. According to statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau in January 2017, housing units completed during 2016 increased almost 10% as compared to 2015. We cannot predict whether these economic trends will improve, stay the same or worsen in the near future.As a result of global economic conditions in recent years, a number of financial institutions sought additional capital, merged with other financial institutions and, in some cases, failed. This turmoil in the financial services industry affected and may continue to affect our results of operations. The failure of one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or large portions of our customer base, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to the possibility of losing a significant client, the inability to recover contract acquisition payments made to one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or the inability to collect accounts receivable or contractually required contract termination payments, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations. There may also be an increase in financial institution mergers and acquisitions during periods of economic uncertainty. Such an increase could adversely affect our operating results. Often the newly combined entity seeks to reduce costs by leveraging economies of scale in purchasing, including its check supply contracts. This results in check providers competing intensely on price in order to retain not only their previous business with one of the financial institutions, but also to gain the business of the other party in the merger/acquisition. Although we devote considerable effort toward the development of a competitively-priced, high-quality suite of products and services for the financial services industry, there can be no assurance that significant financial institution clients will be retained or that the impact of the loss of a significant client can be offset through the addition of new clients or by expanded sales to our remaining clients.A deterioration in financial markets and/or in general business conditions in 2017 would negatively affect our operating results.The cost and availability of materials, delivery services and energy could adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to risks associated with the cost and availability of paper, plastics, ink, retail packaging supplies, promotional materials, other raw materials, delivery services and energy. Paper costs represent a significant portion of our materials cost. Paper is a commodity and its price has been subject to volatility due to supply and demand in the marketplace, 18as well as volatility in the raw material and other costs incurred by our paper suppliers. There are also relatively few paper suppliers. As such, when our suppliers increase paper prices, we may not be able to obtain better pricing from alternative suppliers. Historically, we have not been negatively impacted by paper shortages because of our relationships with paper suppliers. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to purchase sufficient quantities of paper if such a shortage were to occur.We depend upon third-party providers for delivery services and for outsourced products and services. Events resulting in the inability of these service providers to perform their obligations, such as work slowdowns or extended labor strikes, could adversely impact our results of operations by requiring us to secure alternate providers at higher costs. Postal rates are dependent on the operating efficiency of the United States Postal Service (USPS) and on legislative mandates imposed upon the USPS. Postal rates have increased in recent years and the USPS has incurred significant financial losses. This may result in changes to the breadth and/or frequency of USPS mail delivery services in the future. In addition, fuel costs have fluctuated over the past several years. Increased fuel costs can increase the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers, as well as the price we pay for outsourced products and services. Competitive pressures and/or contractual arrangements may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the price of our products.The failure to reduce costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Intense competition, declines in the use of checks and business forms, the commoditization of web services, and sluggish economic conditions compel us to continually improve our operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve profitability. We have significantly reduced costs over the past several years, primarily within sales, marketing, service fulfillment and operational support, as well as our shared services functions, including product fulfillment, information technology, real estate, finance and human resources. We realized net cost reductions of approximately $50 million in 2016, as compared to our 2015 results of operations, and we will continue to explore ways to simplify our business processes and reduce our cost and expense structure. Cost reduction initiatives have required and will continue to require up-front expenditures related to items such as redesigning and streamlining processes, consolidating information technology platforms, standardizing technology applications, further enhancing our strategic supplier sourcing arrangements, improving real estate utilization and funding employee severance benefits. We can provide no assurance that we will achieve future cost reductions or that we will do so without incurring unexpected or greater than anticipated expenditures. Moreover, we may find that we are unable to achieve business simplification and/or cost reduction goals without disrupting our business and, as a result, may choose to delay or forgo certain cost reductions as business conditions require. Failure to continue to improve our operating efficiency could adversely affect our business if we are unable to remain competitive.Asset impairment charges would have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations.Goodwill and an indefinite-lived trade name represented 51.5% of our total assets as of December 31, 2016. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether the carrying value of these assets is impaired. This analysis considers factors including, but not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions. For example, if our stock price were to decline for a sustained period, if a downturn in economic conditions were to negatively affect our actual and forecasted operating results, if order volume declines for our Direct Checks segment were to accelerate, or if recent acquisitions were to fail to achieve expected operating results, these situations could indicate a decline in the fair value of one or more of our reporting units. This may require us to record an impairment charge for a portion of goodwill and/or our indefinite-lived trade name. We are also required to assess the carrying value of other long-lived assets, including intangibles and assets held for sale. If we were required to record an asset impairment charge for any reason, our consolidated results of operations would be adversely affected.We could lose access to data sources which could harm our ability to provide certain of our products and services. We rely upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary and non-proprietary databases, including data received from customers, strategic partners and various government and public record sources. This data includes credit and non-credit data from the national credit bureaus and other data brokers. Although we have not experienced material issues in this regard, our data sources could stop providing data, provide untimely data or increase the costs for their data for a variety of reasons, including legislatively or judicially imposed restrictions on use, a perception that our systems are insecure, or for competitive reasons. If a substantial number of data sources or certain key data sources were to withdraw their services, if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation, if we were to lose exclusive right to the use of data, or if the collection of data were to become uneconomical, our ability to provide our products and services could be negatively impacted. We can provide no assurance that we would be able to obtain data from alternative sources if our current sources become unavailable. Third-party claims could result in costly litigation, and in the event of an unfavorable outcome, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.From time to time, we are involved in claims, litigation and other proceedings relating to the conduct of our business, including purported class action litigation. Such legal proceedings may include claims related to our employment practices, claims alleging breach of contractual obligations, claims asserting deceptive business practices or claims alleging violations of consumer protection-oriented laws. In addition, third parties may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us and/or our clients, which could include aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by non-practicing entities. 19Any such claims could result in litigation against us and could also result in proceedings being brought against us by various federal and state agencies that regulate our business. The number and significance of these claims and proceedings has increased as our businesses have evolved and expanded in scope. These claims, whether successful or not, could divert management's attention, result in costly and time-consuming litigation, or both. Accruals for identified claims or lawsuits are established based on our best estimates of our probable liability. However, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and other dispute resolution mechanisms. Any unfavorable outcome of a material claim or material litigation could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to customer payment-related risks, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.We accept payments for our products and services on our websites by a variety of methods, including credit and debit cards, checks and wire transfers. For debit and credit cards, we pay interchange and other fees that may increase over time. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules and requirements, which have changed over time and could change in the future or be reinterpreted to make it more costly, more difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules and requirements, we may be subject to fines and/or higher transaction fees. Any changes could increase our cost of compliance, which would negatively affect our financial results. We could also lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, which would likely result in the loss of customers and the inability to attract new customers.In addition, we may be liable for fraudulent transactions conducted on our websites, such as the use of stolen credit card numbers. To date, we have not incurred significant losses from payment-related fraud, but we continue to face the risk of losses from this type of fraud. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and other qualified employees, our business could suffer.The success of our business depends on the contributions and abilities of key employees, especially in the areas of sales, marketing, product management, data analytics and information technology. If we are unable to retain our existing employees and/or attract qualified personnel, we may not be able to grow and manage our business effectively. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.We may be unable to protect our rights in intellectual property, which could harm our business and ability to compete.We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret and patent protection, and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks, software and other intellectual property. These protective measures afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products or services that do not infringe on our intellectual property rights. We may be required to spend significant resources to protect our trade secrets and to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete. We may be unable to maintain our licenses to use third-party intellectual property on favorable terms, which would affect our ability to offer licensed products to our customers, and thus, adversely affect our operating results.Check designs licensed from third parties account for a portion of our revenue. These license agreements generally average two to three years in duration. There can be no guarantee that such licenses will be available to us indefinitely or under terms that would allow us to continue to sell the licensed products profitably. If we were to lose the rights to a significant portion of our licensed check designs, it may adversely impact our results of operations.A decline in the value of our postretirement medical plan assets and/or a significant increase in the number of participants in our postretirement medical plan could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.The fair value of our postretirement medical plan assets is subject to various risks, including credit, interest and overall market volatility risk. If the equity markets were to experience a significant decline in value, the fair value of our plan assets would decrease. This would affect the funded status of our plan and result in higher postretirement benefit expense in the future. Although our obligation is limited to funding benefits as they become payable, future declines in the fair value of our plan assets could also result in the need to contribute increased amounts of cash to fund benefits payable under the plan.The number of participants in our postretirement medical plan could increase significantly. For the 2017 plan year, 42% of those eligible to participate in our postretirement medical plan have elected not to participate. If a significant portion of those not participating were to opt-in to our plan, our benefit obligation would increase, which would result in increased expense. Although our plan is currently overfunded, a significant increase in plan participants could also require us to contribute increased amounts of cash to fund benefits payable under the plan.20Our variable-rate indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our term loan facility are subject to variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our interest expense would increase, negatively affecting earnings and reducing cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions"
10,DLX,DELUXE CORP,2016-02-19,"Risk Factors
.Our business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by various risks and uncertainties. These risks include, but are not limited to, the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have disclosed all known material risks. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. You should carefully consider all of these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock or other securities.The following important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the statements we make from time to time regarding our expected future results, including, but not limited to, forecasts regarding estimated total revenue, marketing solutions and other services revenue, earnings per share, cash provided by operating activities and expected cost savings. Any forecast regarding our future performance reflects various assumptions that are subject to significant uncertainties and, as a matter of course, may prove to be incorrect. Further, the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous factors that are beyond our control. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and the variation of actual results or events from such statements may be material and adverse. You are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated statements, and are encouraged to use the entire mix of historical and forward-looking information made available by us, and other information affecting us and our products and services, including the following factors.We may not be successful at implementing our growth strategies.We continue to execute strategies intended to drive sustained revenue and earnings growth, including our focus on increasing marketing solutions and other services revenue, which we believe represents our most significant revenue growth opportunity. We have invested and plan to continue investing in several key enablers to achieve our strategies, including strengthening our portfolio of products and services, including technology-based solutions: enhancing brand awareness and positioning; attracting and retaining customers; growing our distributor, dealer and major accounts networks; improving the customer experience; and investing in small to medium-sized acquisitions. Our business strategies could fall short of our expectations for many reasons, including, among others:•the failure to generate profitable revenue growth; •the failure to acquire new customers, retain our current customers and sell more products and services to current and new customers;•the failure to effectively integrate or leverage the businesses we acquire;•the failure of our digital services and products to achieve widespread customer acceptance;•the inability to promote, strengthen and protect our brand;•the inability to implement improvements to our customer-facing technology in a timely manner; and•a continued challenging economic environment.We can provide no assurance that our growth strategies will be successful either in the short-term or in the long-term, that they will generate a positive return on our investment, or that they will not reduce our operating margins. Additionally, if our strategies are not successful, or if there is market perception that our strategies are not successful, our reputation and brand may be damaged and our stock price may decline.We face intense competition in all areas of our business, and we expect that competition will continue to increase.Although we are one of the leading check printers in the United States, we face considerable competition. In addition to competition from alternative payment methods, we also face intense competition from another large check printer in our traditional financial institution sales channel, from direct mail and internet-based sellers of personal and business checks, from check printing software vendors and from some retailers. The markets for small business and financial services products and services are also intensely competitive, highly fragmented and geographically dispersed. Current and potential Small Business 12Services competitors include traditional storefront printing companies; office superstores; companies offering website design and hosting; wholesale printers; online printing companies; email and social media marketing services companies; media directory providers; and suppliers of custom apparel, promotional products and customized gifts. Current and potential Financial Services competitors include financial institution core processors, advertising agencies, providers of data and analytics marketing solutions, and numerous financial technology services providers offering services such as core data processing solutions, customer and account acquisition, fraud and security risk management, as well as rewards and loyalty solutions. Additionally, the competitive landscape for e-commerce continues to be challenging as new internet businesses are introduced and traditional businesses establish an online presence.We can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. In recent years, our revenue has benefited from price increases in all three of our business segments. Pricing is becoming more competitive for small business product and service providers, as the internet allows customers to easily compare prices. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to increase prices in the future while remaining competitive. Continued competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of customers and brand recognition, and an increase in up-front cash payments to financial institutions upon contract execution or renewal, all of which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.The check printing and related products portion of the payments industry is mature, and check usage is declining.Check printing continues to be an essential part of our business. Revenue generated by the sale of checks was 49.3% of our consolidated revenue in 2015. We sell checks for personal and small business use and believe that there will continue to be a substantial demand for these checks for the foreseeable future. However, the total number of checks written in the United States has been in decline since the mid-1990's. According to the most recent Federal Reserve study released in December 2013, the total number of checks written declined 8.8% each year between 2009 and 2012. We believe that the number of checks written will continue to decline due to the increasing use of alternative payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, direct deposit, wire transfers and internet-based bill paying services, as well as automated teller machines, which make cash a more readily available alternative. In addition, steps have been taken in the development of a real-time payments system in the United States. In January 2015, the Federal Reserve published Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System, which calls on stakeholders to join together to improve the payment system, including developing a faster electronic solution for making a broad variety of business and personal payments. As a result, the Faster Payments Task Force was established with the objective of identifying and evaluating approaches for implementing a faster payments system. The Clearing House Payments Company, LLC (TCH), owned by some of the world's largest commercial banks, has announced that it is moving ahead with concrete plans for a real-time payments system. It has entered into a letter of intent with a United Kingdom-based international payment systems provider to help build and deliver core elements of the real-time payments network and has partnered with a domestic banking technology provider to leverage its existing relationships and key components of its payments technologies. While TCH has not specified a delivery date for the system, the company did state that it would take far less time than the 10 years the Federal Reserve once suggested as a possible timetable. A related study commissioned by the Federal Reserve from McKinsey & Company concluded that check usage could be reduced by one-third if a real-time payments system were to become widely available in the United States.The rate and the extent to which alternative payment methods will achieve acceptance and replace checks, whether as a result of legislative developments, changing payment systems, personal preference or otherwise, cannot be predicted with certainty. A surge in the popularity of any of these alternative payment methods, or our inability to successfully offset the decline in check usage with other sources of revenue, would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Small Business Services' standardized business forms and related products face technological obsolescence and changing customer preferences.Revenue generated by the sale of business forms was 12.2% of our consolidated revenue in 2015. Continual technological improvements have provided small business customers with alternative means to enact and record business transactions. For example, because of the lower price and higher performance capabilities of personal computers, printers and mobile devices, small businesses now have alternate means to print many business forms. Additionally, electronic transaction systems, off-the-shelf business software applications, web-based solutions and mobile applications have been designed to replace pre-printed business forms. It is difficult to predict the pace at which these alternative products and services will gain widespread acceptance. If small business preferences change rapidly and we are unable to develop new products and services with comparable operating margins, our results of operations would be adversely affected.If we are unable to attract customers in a cost effective manner, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.We use a variety of methods to promote our products and services, including direct mail advertising, email marketing, purchased search results from online search engines, broadcast media, and advertising banners, social media and other online links. The profitability of our Direct Checks segment depends in large part on our ability to secure adequate advertising media placements at acceptable rates. We can provide no assurance regarding the future cost, effectiveness and/or availability of suitable advertising media. Additionally, our Direct Checks segment and portions of our Small Business Services segment have, 13at times, experienced declines in response rates related to direct mail promotional materials. While we believe that media response rates have declined across a wide variety of products and services, we believe that the declines we have experienced are also attributable to the decline in check usage, the gradual obsolescence of standardized forms products and increasing use of e-commerce by both consumers and small businesses. In an attempt to offset these impacts, we continually modify our marketing and sales efforts and continue to shift a greater portion of our advertising investment to the internet. Competitive pressure may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the prices of our products and new marketing strategies may not be successful. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to offset a decline in response rates, even with additional marketing and sales efforts.In addition to print and email advertising, many customers come to our websites through internet search engines. If the search engines on which we rely modify their algorithms or terminate their relationship with us, fewer customers may be directed to our websites. As we analyze our overall advertising strategy, we may have to resort to more costly resources to replace lost internet traffic, which would adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the cost of purchased search engine listings will likely increase as demand for them continues to grow, and further cost increases could negatively affect our profitability.We believe we must maintain a relevant, multichannel experience for our customers. Customers expect to be able to order products and services from us however they please, whether that is via the mail, land-line phone, computer, tablet or mobile phone. In particular, the use of smart phones and tablet computing devices has been increasing significantly. The Internet Trends Report published in June 2015 by Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers (KPBC) indicated that mobile devices are now used more than desktops and laptops to access the internet. As current and potential customers increase their use of mobile devices, visits to our websites via traditional computers may decline. Designing and purchasing custom products on mobile devices is more difficult than doing so with a traditional computer due to limited screen sizes and bandwidth. Beyond these difficulties, the development of mobile-oriented user interfaces and other technologies is complex. We are also dependent on the functionality of our systems with web browsers that we do not control. Although we are constantly making investments to update our technology, we cannot predict the success of these investments. Multichannel marketing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with the changing expectations of our customers and new developments by our competitors. If we are unable to implement improvements to our customer-facing technology in a timely manner, or if our customer-facing technology does not function as designed, we could find it increasingly difficult to attract new and repeat visitors to our websites and convert these visitors to customers, which would result in decreased revenue.We may not succeed in promoting and strengthening our brand, which could prevent us from acquiring customers and increasing revenue.The success of Small Business Services depends, in part, on our ability to attract new and repeat customers. For this reason, a component of our business strategy is the promotion and strengthening of the Deluxe brand. We believe that the importance of brand recognition is essential for the success of our service offerings because of the level of competition for these services. Customer awareness of our brand, as well as the perceived value of our brand, will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality customer experience. To promote our brand, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, expense related to advertising and other marketing efforts. We can provide no assurance that these efforts will be successful. During 2015, we entered into a partnership with Robert Herjavec of the television show Shark Tank, which offers us the opportunity to provide marketing support to the businesses in which he invests. If Mr. Herjavec were to become the subject of adverse news reports or negative publicity, such events could reduce the effectiveness of our partnership, which in turn, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. A component of our brand promotion strategy is establishing a relationship of trust with our customers, which we believe can be achieved by providing a high-quality customer experience. We have invested, and will continue to invest, resources in website development, design and technology, and customer service and production operations. Our ability to provide a high-quality customer experience is also dependent on external factors including the reliability and performance of our suppliers, telecommunications providers and third-party carriers. If we are unable to provide a high-quality customer experience for any reason, our reputation may be harmed and our efforts to develop brand loyalty could be adversely impacted. The failure of our brand promotion activities to meet our expectations could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and maintain customer relationships, adversely harming our business and results of operations.Security breaches, computer malware or other cyber attacks involving the confidential information of our customers, employees or business partners, or the perception that e-commerce is not secure, could adversely affect our reputation and business.Information security risks have increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and increased use of the internet, as well as the increased sophistication and activities of hackers, terrorists and activists, some of which may be linked to hostile foreign governments. Our businesses use internet-based channels that collect customers’ account and other sensitive information, and bill customers’ credit card accounts. Within Small Business Services, we provide internet-based marketing services, including web hosting services, which we provide directly to small businesses and through wholesale partners, and in Financial Services, we provide financial institutions a suite of financial technology solutions. We rely on various security procedures and systems to ensure the secure storage and transmission of information, including encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties. Computer networks and the internet are, by nature, vulnerable to 14unauthorized access. An accidental or willful security breach could result in unauthorized access and/or use of customer information, including consumers' nonpublic personal information. Our security measures could be breached by third-party action, computer viruses, accidents, or error or malfeasance by an employee or contractor. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage computer systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect immediately, and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities, fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving employees, contractors and temporary staff. We have encountered threats of this type from time to time, and while to-date, such threats have not materially impacted our business or financial results, we can provide no assurance of a similar result in the future.Although we continue to invest in a system of information security and controls, a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our or our customers' proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation, all of which could deter clients and consumers from ordering our products and services, and result in the termination of client contracts. Any of these events would adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, if we were to experience an information security breach, we may be required to expend significant amounts to remedy, protect against, or mitigate the effect of the breach, and we may not be able to remedy the situation in a timely manner, or at all. We could also be exposed to time-consuming and expensive litigation, government inquiries and/or enforcement actions. If we are unsuccessful in defending a lawsuit regarding information security breaches, we may be forced to pay damages, penalties and fines, any of which would have an adverse effect on our financial results.In addition, there are federal, state and foreign laws requiring companies to notify individuals of information security breaches involving their personal data, the cost of which could negatively affect our financial results. These mandatory disclosures regarding an information security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity. If we were required to make such a disclosure, it may cause our clients and customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our information security measures. Likewise, general publicity regarding information security breaches at other companies could lead to the perception among the general public that e-commerce is not secure. This could decrease traffic to our websites, negatively affect our financial results and limit future business opportunities.We face uncertainty regarding the success of recent and future acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.During 2015, we acquired Datamyx LLC, as well as selected assets of Range, Inc., Verify Valid LLC, Tech Assets, Inc., FMC Resource Management Corporation and FISC Solutions. During 2014, we acquired NetClime, Inc. and Wausau Financial Systems, Inc., as well as selected assets of Gift Box Corporation of America, and during 2013, we acquired VerticalResponse, Inc. and substantially all of the assets of Acton Marketing, LLC and Destination Rewards, Inc. We have invested in acquisitions that offer marketing solutions and other services and that extend the range of products and services we offer to financial institutions and small businesses. In addition, during the past three years, we have purchased the operations of several small business distributors with the intention of growing revenue in our Small Business Services distributor channel. The integration of any acquisition involves numerous risks, including, among others:•difficulties and/or delays in assimilating operations, products and services, as well as ensuring that a strong system of information security and controls is in place; •failure to realize expected synergies and savings; •diversion of management's attention from other business concerns and risks of managing an increasingly diverse set of products and services across expanded and new industries; •decisions by our customers or the customers of the acquired business to temporarily or permanently seek alternate suppliers;•difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies; •potential exposure to unknown liabilities; and•potential loss of key employees.One or more of these factors could impact our ability to successfully integrate an acquisition and could negatively affect our results of operations.We expect to continue to invest in small to medium-sized acquisitions. The time and expense associated with finding suitable businesses, technologies, or services to acquire can be disruptive to our ongoing business and may divert management’s attention. We cannot predict whether suitable acquisition candidates can be acquired on acceptable terms or whether any acquired products, technologies or businesses will contribute to our revenue or earnings to any material extent. Additionally, significant acquisitions typically result in additional contingent liabilities and/or additional amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, and thus, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.15Interruptions to our website operations or information technology systems could damage our reputation and harm our business.The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our information technology systems is critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers. We could experience temporary interruptions in our websites, transaction processing systems, network infrastructure, service technologies, printing production facilities or customer service operations for a variety of reasons, including, among others: human error, software errors, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, vandalism, fire, flood, extreme weather, terrorism, and other events beyond our control. In addition, our technology, infrastructure and processes may contain undetected errors or design faults that may cause our websites or operating systems to fail. The failure of our systems could interfere with the delivery of products and services to our customers, impede our customers' ability to do business and result in the loss or corruption of critical data. In addition to the potential loss of customers, we may be required to incur additional development costs and divert technical and other resources, and we may be the subject of negative publicity and/or liability claims, all of which would adversely affect our reputation and operating results.The cost and availability of materials, delivery services and energy could adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to risks associated with the cost and availability of paper, plastics, ink, retail packaging supplies, promotional materials, other raw materials, delivery services, and energy. Paper costs represent a significant portion of our materials cost. Paper is a commodity and its price has been subject to significant volatility due to supply and demand in the marketplace, as well as volatility in the raw material and other costs incurred by our paper suppliers. There are also relatively few paper suppliers. As such, when our suppliers increase paper prices, we may not be able to obtain better pricing from alternative suppliers. Historically, we have not been negatively impacted by paper shortages because of our relationships with paper suppliers. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to purchase sufficient quantities of paper if such a shortage were to occur.We depend upon third-party providers for delivery services and for outsourced products and services. Events resulting in the inability of these service providers to perform their obligations, such as work slowdowns or extended labor strikes, could adversely impact our results of operations by requiring us to secure alternate providers at higher costs. Postal rates are dependent on the operating efficiency of the United States Postal Service (USPS) and on legislative mandates imposed upon the USPS. Postal rates have increased in recent years and the USPS has incurred significant financial losses. This may result in changes to the breadth and/or frequency of USPS mail delivery services in the future. In addition, fuel costs have fluctuated over the past several years. Increased fuel costs can increase the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers, as well as the price we pay for outsourced products. Competitive pressures and/or contractual arrangements may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the price of our products.If we do not adapt to changes in technology in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to sustain and grow our business could be adversely affected.Changes in the nature of technology solutions used by small businesses and their customers may occur rapidly. In addition, the markets for many of the services provided by our Financial Services segment are characterized by constant technological changes. The introduction of competing products and services using new technologies, the evolution of industry standards or the introduction of more attractive products or services could make some or all of our products and services less desirable, or even obsolete. These potential changes are magnified by the continued rapid growth of the internet and the intense competition we face. To be successful, our technology-based products and services must keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards, address the ever-changing and increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers, and achieve market acceptance. We could lose current and potential customers if we are unable to develop products and services that meet these changing demands in a timely manner. Additionally, our operating results could be adversely affected if we are required to incur substantial costs to keep pace with technological advances.Asset impairment charges would have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations.Goodwill and an indefinite-lived trade name represented 54.0% of our total assets as of December 31, 2015. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether the carrying value of these assets is impaired. This analysis considers factors including, but not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions. For example, if our stock price were to decline for a sustained period, if a downturn in economic conditions were to negatively affect our actual and forecasted operating results, if order volume declines for our Direct Checks segment were to accelerate, or if recent acquisitions were to fail to achieve expected operating results, these situations could indicate a decline in the fair value of one or more of our reporting units. This may require us to record an impairment charge for a portion of goodwill and/or our indefinite-lived trade name. We are also required to assess the carrying value of other long-lived assets, including intangibles and assets held for sale. If we were required to record an asset impairment charge for any reason, our consolidated results of operations would be adversely affected.Governmental regulation could limit or harm our business.Portions of our business are subject to regulations implementing the privacy and information security requirements of the federal financial modernization law known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, as well as the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions 16Act, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and other federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the protection of certain consumer information. These laws and regulations require us to develop, implement and maintain policies and procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of consumers' nonpublic personal information. In addition, some of our recently acquired businesses trigger compliance requirements under laws governing remote deposit capture, use of consumer report data, and payment processing. We are also subject to additional requirements in certain of our contracts with financial institution clients and communications service providers, which are often more restrictive than the regulations, as well as confidentiality clauses in certain of our contracts related to small businesses’ customer information. These regulations and agreements limit our ability to use or disclose nonpublic personal information for other than the purposes originally intended, which could limit business opportunities. Proposed data breach regulations may increase the costs of compliance for the protection of nonpublic personal information. The complexity of compliance with regulations, as well as the increased focus on cyber security, may also increase our cost of doing business. It may also affect our financial institution clients, reducing their discretionary spending and thus, possibly reducing the amount they spend on our products and services.Due to our increasing use of the internet for sales and marketing, laws specifically governing digital commerce, the internet, mobile applications, behavioral advertising and email marketing may have an impact on our business. Existing and future laws governing issues such as privacy, consumer protection or commercial email may limit our ability to market and provide our products and services. Pending global data protection regulations may increase the costs of compliance in servicing international markets for our wholesale business services channels. Additionally, we could be impacted if laws are enacted related to the liability of online businesses for actions taken by their customers, including fraud, illegal content, spam, phishing, libel, defamation, and other abusive conduct. More restrictive legislation, such as new privacy laws, search engine marketing restrictions, “anti-spam” regulations, or email privacy rules, could decrease marketing opportunities, decrease traffic to our websites, and/or increase the cost of obtaining new customers.The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ""Act"") continues to increase the complexity of consumer protection rules for financial institutions and introduces more stringent regulatory capital requirements for financial institutions. It is likely that the Act has and will continue to have a negative impact on the profitability of our financial institution clients as they incur costs to comply with the new regulations. A report published in December 2015 by the United States Government Accountability Office indicated that the Act is negatively affecting the profitability of financial institutions, but its full impact remains uncertain because many of its rules have yet to be implemented and insufficient time has passed to evaluate others. Because of the additional costs, financial institutions may put significant pricing pressure on their suppliers, including their check and service providers. The increase in cost and profit pressure may also lead to further consolidation of financial institutions. Additionally, the Act gave the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) the authority to pursue financial institutions engaged in unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. The CFPB’s rule-making and enforcement power may also extend to financial institutions’ service providers. This has made some financial institutions wary of offering add-on services, such as fraud/identity protection, expedited check delivery or rewards programs, to their customers. It would have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we were unable to market such services to consumers or small businesses through our financial institution clients. Additionally, as our product and service offerings become more technologically focused, and with expanded regulatory expectations for supervision of third-party service providers, additional portions of our business could become subject to direct federal regulation and/or examination. This would increase our cost of doing business and could slow our ability to introduce new products and services and otherwise adapt to a rapidly changing business environment.The Securities and Exchange Commission issued final rules mandated by the Act regarding disclosure of the use of tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold, known as conflict minerals, in products manufactured by public companies. These rules require a reasonable country of origin inquiry to determine whether such minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. Accordingly, we implemented a reasonable country of origin inquiry program, which resulted in our disclosures relating to conflict minerals in May 2014 and May 2015. There are costs associated with complying with these rules and the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products could be adversely affected. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict-free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origin of all conflict minerals used in our products.   Economic conditions could have an adverse effect on operating results in each of our business segments.Economic conditions have affected, and will continue to affect, our results of operations and financial position. Current and future economic conditions that affect consumer and business spending, including unemployment levels, the availability of credit, and small business confidence, as well as the financial condition and growth prospects of our customers, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.A significant portion of our business relies on small business spending. As such, the level of small business confidence and the rate of small business formations and closures impact our business. In recent years, below average small business optimism, as well as declines in small business formations and increases in small business closures, negatively impacted our results of operations and/or our growth opportunities in Small Business Services. We believe small businesses are more likely to be significantly affected by economic downturns than larger, more established companies. During a sluggish economy, it may be more difficult for small businesses to obtain credit and small businesses may choose to spend their limited funds on items other than our products and services. Within our personal check printing businesses, consumer spending, employment levels, and housing stock and starts impact the number of checks consumers use. Moderate growth in consumer spending and private 17sector employment during 2015 most likely had a neutral impact on our personal check businesses. An increase in housing stock and starts has a positive impact on the number of checks purchased, as new households typically are in need of new checks. According to statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau in January 2016, housing units completed during 2015 increased 9% as compared to 2014. We cannot predict whether these economic trends will improve, stay the same or worsen in the near future.As a result of global economic conditions in recent years, a number of financial institutions sought additional capital, merged with other financial institutions and, in some cases, failed. This turmoil in the financial services industry affected and may continue to affect our results of operations. The failure of one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or large portions of our customer base, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to the possibility of losing a significant client, the inability to recover contract acquisition payments made to one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or the inability to collect accounts receivable or contractually required contract termination payments, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations. There may also be an increase in financial institution mergers and acquisitions during periods of economic uncertainty. Such an increase could adversely affect our operating results. Often the newly combined entity seeks to reduce costs by leveraging economies of scale in purchasing, including its check supply contracts. This results in check providers competing intensely on price in order to retain not only their previous business with one of the financial institutions, but also to gain the business of the other party in the merger/acquisition. Although we devote considerable effort toward the development of a competitively-priced, high-quality suite of products and services for the financial services industry, there can be no assurance that significant financial institution clients will be retained or that the impact of the loss of a significant client can be offset through the addition of new clients or by expanded sales to our remaining clients.A deterioration in financial markets and/or in general business conditions in 2016 would negatively affect our operating results.If third-party providers of certain significant information technology needs are unable to provide services, our business could be disrupted and the cost of such services could increase.We have entered into agreements with third-party providers for information technology services, including telecommunications, network server and transaction processing services. In addition, we have agreements with companies to provide services such as on-line payment solutions. A service provider's ability to provide services could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including unauthorized access, computer viruses, accidental or intentional actions, electrical disruptions, or other conditions. In the event that one or more of our service providers is unable to provide adequate or timely information technology services, our ability to deliver products and services to our customers could be adversely affected. Although we believe we have taken adequate steps to protect our business through contractual arrangements with our service providers, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of disruption in service. Any significant disruption could harm our business, including damage to our brand and loss of customers. Additionally, although we believe that information technology services are available from numerous sources, a failure to perform by one or more of our service providers could cause a disruption in our business while we obtain an alternative source of supply. The use of substitute third-party providers could also result in increased expense.The failure to reduce costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Intense competition, declines in the use of checks and business forms, the commoditization of web services, and sluggish economic conditions compel us to continually improve our operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve profitability. We have significantly reduced costs over the past several years, primarily within sales, marketing, service fulfillment and operational support, as well as our shared services functions, including product fulfillment, information technology, real estate, finance and human resources. We realized net cost reductions of approximately $50 million in 2015, as compared to our 2014 results of operations, and we will continue to explore ways to simplify our business processes and reduce our cost and expense structure. Cost reduction initiatives have required and will continue to require up-front expenditures related to items such as redesigning and streamlining processes, consolidating information technology platforms, standardizing technology applications, further enhancing our strategic supplier sourcing arrangements, improving real estate utilization and funding employee severance benefits. We can provide no assurance that we will achieve future cost reductions or that we will do so without incurring unexpected or greater than anticipated expenditures. Moreover, we may find that we are unable to achieve business simplification and/or cost reduction goals without disrupting our business and, as a result, may choose to delay or forgo certain cost reductions as business conditions require. Failure to continue to improve our operating efficiency could adversely affect our business if we are unable to remain competitive.We may be unable to maintain our licenses to use third-party intellectual property on favorable terms, which would affect our ability to offer licensed products to our customers, and thus, adversely affect our operating results.Check designs licensed from third parties account for a portion of our revenue. These license agreements generally average two to three years in duration. There can be no guarantee that such licenses will be available to us indefinitely or under terms that would allow us to continue to sell the licensed products profitably, which would adversely impact our results of operations.18Third-party claims could result in costly litigation, and in the event of an unfavorable outcome, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.From time to time, we are involved in claims, litigation and other proceedings relating to the conduct of our business, including purported class action litigation. Such legal proceedings may include claims related to our employment practices, claims asserting deceptive business practices or claims alleging violations of consumer protection-oriented laws. In addition, third parties may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us and/or our clients, which could include aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by non-practicing entities. Any such claims could result in litigation against us and could also result in regulatory proceedings being brought against us by various federal and state agencies that regulate our business. These claims, whether successful or not, could divert management's attention or result in costly and time-consuming litigation. Accruals for identified claims or lawsuits are established based on our best estimates of our probable liability. However, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation. Any unfavorable outcome of a material claim or material litigation could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to customer payment-related risks, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.We accept payments for our products and services on our websites by a variety of methods, including credit and debit cards, checks and wire transfers. For debit and credit cards, we pay interchange and other fees that may increase over time. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules and requirements, which have changed over time and could change in the future or be reinterpreted to make it more costly, more difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules and requirements, we may be subject to fines and/or higher transaction fees. Any changes could increase our cost of compliance, which would negatively affect our financial results. We could also lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, which would likely result in the loss of customers and the inability to attract new customers.In addition, we may be liable for fraudulent transactions conducted on our websites, such as the use of stolen credit card numbers. To date, we have not incurred significant losses from payment-related fraud, but we continue to face the risk of losses from this type of fraud. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and other qualified employees, our business could suffer.The success of our business depends on the contributions and abilities of key employees, especially in the areas of sales, marketing, product management, and information technology. If we are unable to retain our existing employees and/or attract qualified personnel, we may not be able to grow and manage our business effectively. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.Sales and other tax collection requirements could have an adverse effect on our business.We currently collect sales, use and similar taxes in jurisdictions where our legal entities have a physical presence, in accordance with existing state and local tax laws. If one or more state or local jurisdictions enacts legislation requiring collection beyond our current practices, the increased cost to our customers may discourage them from purchasing our products and services, which would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if one or more state or local jurisdictions successfully asserts that we should have collected sales or other taxes in the past, but did not, we could incur a substantial liability for uncollected taxes.We may be unable to protect our rights in intellectual property, which could harm our business and ability to compete.We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret and patent protection, and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks, software and other intellectual property. These protective measures afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products or services that do not infringe on our intellectual property rights. We may be required to spend significant resources to protect our trade secrets and to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete. We are subject to environmental risks which, if realized, could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Our printing facilities are subject to many federal, state and local regulations designed to protect the environment, including those related to air emissions, wastewater discharge, waste disposal, and remediation of contaminated sites. We have sold former printing facilities to third parties and, in some instances, have agreed to indemnify the buyer of the facility for certain environmental liabilities. Unforeseen conditions at current or former facilities could result in additional liability and expense beyond our insurance coverage.The effects of human activity on global climate change have attracted considerable public and scientific attention, as well as the attention of the United States government. Regulation or some form of legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas 19emissions is currently being implemented in the United States, as well as globally. Increased government regulation to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change could result in increased compliance costs and other financial obligations, which would adversely affect our operating results.A decline in the value of our postretirement medical plan assets and/or a significant increase in the number of participants in our postretirement medical plan could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.The fair value of our postretirement medical plan assets is subject to various risks, including credit, interest and overall market volatility risk. If the equity markets were to experience a significant decline in value, the fair value of our plan assets would decrease. This would affect the funded status of our plan and result in higher postretirement benefit expense in the future. Although our obligation is limited to funding benefits as they become payable, future declines in the fair value of our plan assets could also result in the need to contribute increased amounts of cash to fund benefits payable under the plan.The number of participants in our postretirement medical plan could increase significantly. For the 2016 plan year, 48% of those eligible to participate in our postretirement medical plan have elected not to participate. If a significant portion of those not participating were to opt-in to our plan, our benefit obligation would increase, which would result in increased expense. Although our plan is currently overfunded, a significant increase in plan participants could also require us to contribute increased amounts of cash to fund benefits payable under the plan"
15,DLX,DELUXE CORP,2015-02-20,"Risk Factors
.Our business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by various risks and uncertainties. These risks include, but are not limited to, the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have disclosed all known material risks. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. You should carefully consider all of these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock or other securities.The following important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the statements we make from time to time regarding our expected future results, including, but not limited to, forecasts regarding estimated total revenue, marketing solutions and other services revenue, earnings per share and cash provided by operating activities. Any forecast regarding our future performance reflects various assumptions which are subject to significant uncertainties and, as a matter of course, may prove to be incorrect. Further, the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous factors which are beyond our control. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and the variation of actual results or events from such statements may be material and adverse. You are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated statements, and are encouraged to use the entire mix of historical and forward-looking information made available by us, and other information affecting us and our products and services, including the following factors.We may not be successful at implementing our growth strategies.We continue to execute strategies intended to drive sustained revenue and earnings growth, including our focus on increasing marketing solutions and other services revenue, which we believe represents our most significant revenue growth opportunity. We have invested and will continue to invest in several key enablers to achieve our strategies, including strengthening our portfolio of products and services, including technology-based solutions: enhancing brand awareness and positioning; attracting and retaining customers; growing our distributor, dealer and major accounts networks; improving the customer experience; and investing in small to medium-sized acquisitions. Our business strategies could fall short of our expectations for many reasons, including, among others:•the inability to promote, strengthen and protect our brand;•the failure to acquire new customers, retain our current customers and sell more products and services to current and new customers;•the failure of our internet services and products to achieve widespread customer acceptance;•the inability to implement improvements to our customer-facing technology in a timely manner;•the failure to generate profitable revenue growth; and•the failure to effectively integrate the businesses we acquire.12We can provide no assurance that our growth strategies will be successful either in the short-term or in the long-term, that they will generate a positive return on our investment, or that they will not reduce our operating margins. Additionally, if our strategies are not successful, or if there is market perception that our strategies are not successful, our reputation and brand may be damaged and our stock price may decline.We face intense competition in all areas of our business, and we expect that competition will continue to increase.Although we are one of the leading check printers in the United States, we face considerable competition. In addition to competition from alternative payment methods, we also face intense competition from another large check printer in our traditional financial institution sales channel, from direct mail and internet-based sellers of personal and business checks, from check printing software vendors and from some retailers. The markets for small business and financial services products and services are also intensely competitive, highly fragmented and geographically dispersed. Current and potential small business competitors include traditional storefront printing companies; office superstores; companies offering website design and hosting; wholesale printers; online printing companies; email marketing services companies; and suppliers of custom apparel, promotional products and customized gifts. Current and potential Financial Services competitors include financial institution core processors, advertising agencies and numerous financial technology services providers, as well as companies offering financial services technology products, including integrated payment processing, core data processing solutions, customer and account acquisition, fraud and security risk management, and rewards and loyalty solutions. Additionally, the competitive landscape for e-commerce continues to be challenging as new internet businesses are introduced and traditional businesses establish an online presence.We can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. In recent years, our revenue has benefited from price increases in all three of our business segments. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to increase prices in the future while remaining competitive. Continued competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of customers and brand recognition, and an increase in up-front cash payments to financial institutions upon contract execution or renewal, all of which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.The check printing and related products portion of the payments industry is mature and, if check usage declines faster than expected, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Check printing is, and is expected to continue to be, an essential part of our business. We sell checks for personal and small business use and believe that there will continue to be a substantial demand for these checks for the foreseeable future. However, the total number of checks written in the United States has been in decline since the mid-1990's. According to the most recent Federal Reserve study released in December 2013, the total number of checks written declined 8.8% each year between 2009 and 2012. We believe that the number of checks written will continue to decline due to the increasing use of alternative payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, direct deposit, wire transfers and internet-based bill paying services, as well as automated teller machines, which make cash a more readily available alternative. In addition, during 2014, the Federal Reserve Banks and the Federal Reserve Board announced a plan to work with payment stakeholders to develop faster or real-time payments. The Clearing House Payments Company, LLC, owned by some of the world's largest commercial banks, also announced plans to undertake a multi-year effort to build a real-time payment system to better meet consumers' and businesses' expectations in an increasingly digital economy. A related study commissioned by the Federal Reserve from McKinsey & Company concluded that check usage would be reduced by one-third if a real-time payments system were to become widely available. The parties involved did not release specific timelines as to when a real-time payment system could be implemented.The rate and the extent to which alternative payment methods will achieve acceptance and replace checks, whether as a result of legislative developments, changing payment systems, personal preference or otherwise, cannot be predicted with certainty. A surge in the popularity of any of these alternative payment methods, or our inability to successfully offset the decline in check usage with other sources of revenue, would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Small Business Services' standardized business forms and related products face technological obsolescence and changing customer preferences.Continual technological improvements provide small business customers with alternative means to enact and record business transactions. For example, because of the lower price and higher performance capabilities of personal computers, printers and mobile devices, small businesses now have alternate means to print many business forms. Additionally, electronic transaction systems, off-the-shelf business software applications, web-based solutions and mobile applications have been designed to replace pre-printed business forms. It is difficult to predict the pace at which these alternative products and services will gain widespread acceptance. If small business preferences change rapidly and we are unable to develop new products and services with comparable operating margins, our results of operations would be adversely affected.13If we are unable to attract customers in a cost effective manner, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.We rely on a variety of methods to promote our products and services, including direct mail advertising, e-mail marketing, purchased search results from online search engines, broadcast media, and advertising banners, social media and other online links. The profitability of our Direct Checks segment depends in large part on our ability to secure adequate advertising media placements at acceptable rates. We can provide no assurance regarding the future cost, effectiveness and/or availability of suitable advertising media. Additionally, our Direct Checks segment and portions of our Small Business Services segment have, at times, experienced declines in response rates related to direct mail promotional materials. While we believe that media response rates have declined across a wide variety of products and services, we believe that the declines we have experienced are also attributable to the decline in check usage, the gradual obsolescence of standardized forms products and increasing utilization of e-commerce by both consumers and small businesses. In an attempt to offset these impacts, we continually modify our marketing and sales efforts and continue to shift a greater portion of our advertising investment to the internet. Competitive pressure may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the prices of our products and new marketing strategies may not be successful. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to offset a decline in response rates, even with additional marketing and sales efforts.Future legislation could affect our ability to advertise via direct mail or e-mail. Congress has contemplated enacting more restrictive “anti-spam” legislation in response to consumer complaints about unsolicited e-mail advertisements. If more restrictive anti-spam legislation is enacted and/or if similar legislation is enacted for direct mail advertisers, we may be unable to sustain our current levels of profitability.In addition to print and e-mail advertising, many customers access our websites through internet search engines. Search engines typically provide two types of search results, algorithmic and purchased listings. Algorithmic listings are not purchased, but are determined and displayed solely by a set of formulas designed by the search engine. Purchased listings can be bought to attract users to our websites. We rely on both algorithmic and purchased listings to attract customers to our websites. Search engines revise their algorithms from time to time in an attempt to optimize their search results listings and to maximize the advertising revenue generated by those listings. If search engines on which we rely for algorithmic listings modify their algorithms, this could result in fewer customers going to our websites. Additionally, one or more of the search engines on which we rely for purchased listings could modify or terminate their relationship with us. As we analyze our overall advertising strategy, we may have to resort to more costly resources to replace lost internet traffic, which would adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the cost of purchased search engine listings could increase as demand for them continues to grow, and further cost increases could negatively affect our profitability.Another trend impacting our customer interactions is that the use of smart phone and tablet computing devices is increasing. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Smart Connected Device Tracker report published in September 2014, 88% of connected device sales by 2018 will be tablets, phablets (i.e., smart phones with screen sizes from 5.5 inches to less than 7 inches), and smart phones. As current and potential customers increase their use of mobile devices, visits to our websites via traditional computers may decline. Designing and purchasing custom products on mobile devices is more difficult than doing so with a traditional computer due to limited screen sizes and bandwidth. Beyond these difficulties, our technology may not be optimized for mobile devices, and the development of mobile-oriented user interfaces and other technologies is complex. Although we are constantly making investments to update our technology, we cannot predict the success of these investments. If the market shift to mobile devices accelerates faster than we are able to make the necessary changes, we could find it increasingly difficult to attract new and repeat visitors to our websites and convert these visitors to customers, which would result in decreased revenue.We may not succeed in promoting and strengthening our brand, which could prevent us from acquiring customers and increasing revenue.The success of Small Business Services depends, in part, on our ability to attract new and repeat customers. For this reason, a component of our business strategy is the promotion and strengthening of the Deluxe brand. We believe that the importance of brand recognition is essential for the success of our service offerings because of the level of competition for these services. Customer awareness of our brand, as well as the perceived value of our brand, will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality customer experience. To promote our brand, we have incurred and will continue to incur expense related to advertising and other marketing efforts. We can provide no assurance that we will realize a positive return on this investment.A component of our brand promotion strategy is establishing a relationship of trust with our customers, which we believe can be achieved by providing a high quality customer experience. We have invested, and will continue to invest, resources in website development, design and technology, and customer service and production operations. Our ability to provide a high quality customer experience is also dependent on external factors including the reliability and performance of our suppliers, telecommunications providers and third-party carriers. If we are unable to provide a high quality customer experience for any reason, our reputation would be harmed and our efforts to develop brand loyalty would be adversely impacted. The failure of our brand promotion activities could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and maintain customer relationships, which would adversely harm our business and results of operations.14Security breaches, computer malware or other cyber attacks involving the confidential information of our customers, employees or business partners, or the perception that e-commerce is not secure, could adversely affect our reputation and business.Online commerce and communications depend on the secure storage and transmission of confidential information over public networks. Some of our businesses use internet-based channels, which collect customers’ bank account and other personal information, and bill customers’ credit card accounts. Within Small Business Services, we provide internet-based marketing services, including web hosting services, which we provide directly to small businesses and through wholesale partners. We rely on various security procedures and systems to ensure the secure storage and transmission of information, including encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties. Computer networks and the internet are, by nature, vulnerable to unauthorized access. An accidental or willful security breach could result in unauthorized access and/or use of customer information, including consumers' nonpublic personal information. Our security measures could be breached by third-party action, computer viruses, accidents, or error or malfeasance by an employee or contractor. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage computer systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect immediately, and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities, fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving employees, contractors and temporary staff. We have encountered threats of this type from time to time, none of which have materially impacted our business or financial results.Although we maintain a system of information security and controls, a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our or our customers' proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation, all of which could deter clients and consumers from ordering our products and services, and result in the termination of client contracts. Any of these events would adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, if we were to experience an information security breach, we may be required to expend significant amounts to remedy, protect against, or mitigate the effect of the breach, and we may not be able to remedy the situation in a timely manner, or at all. We could also be exposed to time-consuming and expensive litigation and government inquiries and/or enforcement actions. If we are unsuccessful in defending a lawsuit regarding information security breaches, we may be forced to pay damages, penalties and fines, any of which would have an adverse effect on our financial results.In addition, there are federal, state and foreign laws requiring companies to notify individuals of information security breaches involving their personal data, the cost of which could negatively affect our financial results. These mandatory disclosures regarding an information security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity. If we were required to make such a disclosure, it may cause our clients and customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our information security measures. Likewise, general publicity regarding information security breaches at other companies could lead to the perception among the general public that e-commerce is not secure. This could decrease traffic to our websites, negatively affect our financial results and limit future business opportunities.We face uncertainty regarding the success of recent and future acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.During 2014, we acquired NetClime, Inc. and Wausau Financial Systems, Inc., as well as selected assets of Gift Box Corporation of America. During 2013, we acquired VerticalResponse, Inc. and substantially all of the assets of Acton Marketing, LLC and Destination Rewards, Inc., and during 2012, we acquired OrangeSoda, Inc. We have invested in acquisitions that offer marketing solutions and other services and that extend the range of products and services we offer to financial institutions and small businesses. In addition, during the past three years, we have purchased the operations of several small business distributors with the intention of growing revenue in our Small Business Services distributor channel. The integration of any acquisition involves numerous risks, including, among others:•difficulties and/or delays in assimilating operations, technologies and products; •failure to realize expected synergies and savings; •diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; •decisions by our customers or the customers of the acquired business to temporarily or permanently seek alternate suppliers;•potential loss of key employees; •difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies; and•potential exposure to unknown liabilities.One or more of these factors could impact our ability to successfully integrate an acquisition and could negatively affect our results of operations.We may continue to invest in small to medium-sized acquisitions. The time and expense associated with finding suitable businesses, technologies, or services to acquire can be disruptive to our ongoing business and may divert management’s attention. We cannot predict whether suitable acquisition candidates can be acquired on acceptable terms or whether any 15acquired products, technologies or businesses will contribute to our revenue or earnings to any material extent. Additionally, significant acquisitions typically result in additional contingent liabilities and/or additional amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, and thus, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Interruptions to our website operations or information technology systems could damage our reputation and harm our business.The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our information technology systems is critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers. We could experience temporary interruptions in our websites, transaction processing systems, network infrastructure, service technologies, printing production facilities or customer service operations for a variety of reasons including, among others: human error, software errors, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, fire, flood, extreme weather, terrorism, and other events beyond our control. In addition, our technology, infrastructure and processes may contain undetected errors or design faults which may cause our websites or operating systems to fail. The failure of our systems could interfere with the delivery of services to our customers and impede our customers' ability to do business. In addition to the potential loss of customers, we may be required to incur additional development costs and divert technical and other resources, and we may be the subject of negative publicity and/or liability claims, all of which would adversely affect our reputation and operating results.The cost and availability of materials, delivery services and energy could adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to risks associated with the cost and availability of paper, plastics, ink, retail packaging, promotional materials, other raw materials, delivery services, and energy. There are relatively few paper suppliers. As such, when our suppliers increase paper prices, we may not be able to obtain better pricing from alternative suppliers. Postal rates have increased in recent years and the United States Postal Service (USPS) has incurred significant financial losses. This may result in changes to the breadth and/or frequency of USPS mail delivery services in the future. Also, fuel costs have fluctuated over the past several years, sometimes resulting in fuel surcharges for delivery services. Competitive pressures and/or contractual arrangements may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the price of our products.Paper costs represent a significant portion of our materials cost. Historically, we have not been negatively impacted by paper shortages because of our relationships with paper suppliers. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to purchase sufficient quantities of paper if such a shortage were to occur. Additionally, we depend upon third party providers for delivery services and for outsourced products and services. Events resulting in the inability of these service providers to perform their obligations, such as extended labor strikes, could adversely impact our results of operations by requiring us to secure alternate providers at higher costs.If we do not adapt to changes in technology in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to sustain and grow our business could be adversely affected.Changes in the way the internet operates or in how it is used by small businesses and their customers may occur rapidly. The introduction of competing products and services using new technologies, the evolution of industry standards or the introduction of more attractive products or services could make some or all of our web-based products and services less desirable, or even obsolete. These potential changes are magnified by the continued rapid growth of the internet and the intense competition we face. To be successful, our technology-based products and services must keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards and address the ever-changing and increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers. We could lose current and potential customers if we are unable to develop products and services that meet these changing demands in a timely manner. Additionally, our operating results could be adversely affected if we are required to incur substantial costs to keep pace with technological advances.Asset impairment charges would have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations.Goodwill and an indefinite-lived trade name represented 53% of our total assets as of December 31, 2014. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether the carrying value of these assets is impaired. This analysis considers factors including, but not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions. For example, if our stock price were to decline for a sustained period, if a downturn in economic conditions were to negatively affect our actual and forecasted operating results, or if order volume declines for our Direct Checks segment were to accelerate, these situations could indicate a decline in the fair value of one or more of our reporting units. This may require us to record an impairment charge for a portion of goodwill and/or our indefinite-lived trade name. We are also required to assess the carrying value of other long-lived assets, including intangibles and assets held for sale. If we were required to record an asset impairment charge for any reason, our consolidated results of operations would be adversely affected.Governmental regulation could limit or harm our business.Portions of our business are subject to regulations implementing the privacy and information security requirements of the federal financial modernization law known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, as well as the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and other federal and foreign regulation and state law regarding the protection 16of consumer information. These laws and regulations require us to develop, implement and maintain policies and procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of consumers' nonpublic personal information. We are also subject to additional requirements in certain of our contracts with financial institution clients, which are often more restrictive than the regulations, as well as confidentiality clauses in certain of our communication service provider contracts that cover small businesses’ customer information. These regulations and agreements limit our ability to use or disclose nonpublic personal information for other than the purposes originally intended, which could limit business opportunities. Proposed data breach regulations may increase the costs of compliance for the protection of nonpublic personal information. The complexity of compliance with regulations, as well as the increased focus on cyber security, may also increase the cost of doing business.Due to our increasing use of the internet for sales and marketing, laws specifically governing the internet, e-commerce, mobile applications, behavioral advertising and email marketing may have an impact on our business. Existing and future laws governing issues such as privacy, consumer protection or commercial email may impede the growth of the internet and our ability to market and provide our products and services. Additionally, we could be impacted if laws are enacted related to the liability of online businesses for actions taken by their customers, including fraud, illegal content, spam, phishing, libel, defamation, and other abusive conduct. It is not always clear how existing laws governing these and other issues apply to the internet and e-commerce, as the vast majority of applicable laws were adopted before the advent of the internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by e-commerce. Those laws that do reference the internet, such as the U.S. CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act, are only beginning to be interpreted by the courts. More restrictive legislation, such as new privacy laws, search engine marketing restrictions or “anti-spam” regulations, could decrease traffic to our websites, decrease marketing opportunities and increase the cost of obtaining new customers.The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ""Act"") was enacted in 2010. The Act implements changes that affect the oversight and supervision of financial institutions, creates a new agency responsible for implementing and enforcing compliance with consumer financial laws and introduces more stringent regulatory capital requirements for financial institutions. The full impact of the Act and/or any additional related regulatory changes remains unclear due to the slow pace at which formal rulemaking is being finalized. It is likely that the Act has and will have a negative impact on the profitability of our financial institution clients as they incur costs to comply with the new regulations. Because of these additional costs, financial institutions may put significant pricing pressure on their suppliers, including their check and service providers. The increase in cost and profit pressure may also lead to further consolidation of financial institutions. Additionally, the Act gave the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) the authority to pursue financial institutions engaged in unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. The CFPB’s rule-making and enforcement power may also extend to financial institutions’ service providers. This has made some financial institutions wary of offering add-on services, such as fraud/identity protection or expedited check delivery, to their customers. It would have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we were unable to market such services to consumers or small businesses through our financial institution clients. Additionally, as our product and service offerings become more technologically focused, and with expanded regulatory expectations for supervision of third party service providers, portions of our business could become subject to direct federal regulation and/or examination. This would increase our cost of doing business and could slow our ability to introduce new products and services and otherwise adapt to a rapidly changing business environment.In August 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued final rules mandated by the Act regarding disclosure of the use of tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold, known as conflict minerals, in products manufactured by public companies. These rules require a reasonable country of origin inquiry to determine whether such minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. Accordingly, we began our reasonable country of origin inquiries in 2013, with our initial disclosure relating to conflict minerals occurring in May 2014. There are costs associated with complying with these rules and the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products could be adversely affected. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict-free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origin of all conflict minerals used in our products.   Economic conditions could continue to have an adverse effect on our operating results in each of our business segments.Domestic and global economic conditions have affected, and will continue to affect, our results of operations and financial position. Current and future economic conditions that affect consumer and business spending, including unemployment levels, the availability of credit and small business confidence, as well as the financial condition and growth prospects of our customers, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.A significant portion of our business relies on small business spending. As such, the level of small business confidence and the rate of small business formations and closures impact our business. In recent years, below average small business optimism, as well as declines in small business formations and increases in small business closures, negatively impacted our results of operations and/or our growth opportunities in Small Business Services. We believe small businesses are more likely to be significantly affected by economic downturns than larger, more established companies. During a sluggish economy, it may be more difficult for small businesses to obtain credit and small businesses may choose to spend their limited funds on items other than our products and services. Within our personal check printing businesses, consumer spending, employment levels and housing stock and starts impact the number of checks consumers use. Modest growth in consumer spending and private sector employment during 2014 most likely had a neutral impact on our personal check businesses, while housing stock did improve during 2014, as compared to 2013. An increase in housing stock has a positive impact on the number of checks purchased, as 17new households typically are in need of new checks. We cannot predict whether these economic trends will improve, stay the same or worsen in the near future.As a result of global economic conditions in recent years, a number of financial institutions sought additional capital, merged with other financial institutions and, in some cases, failed. This turmoil in the financial services industry affected and may continue to affect our results of operations in a number of ways.Our experience indicates that financial institution failures, as well as the consolidation of companies within the financial services industry, may have caused some larger financial institutions to lose customers. The most recent study published by management consulting firm cg42 in July 2013 indicated that 26% of the top 10 retail banks’ customers expressed that they are frustrated with their primary banks, and 15% of these customers are actively pursuing a change in their banking relationship. The loss of customers for some financial institutions may reduce our order volume when those customers move their accounts to financial institutions that are not our clients, or customers may reduce or delay their check purchases while they are considering changing banks.The failure of one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or large portions of our customer base, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to the possibility of losing a significant client, the inability to recover contract acquisition payments made to one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or the inability to collect accounts receivable or contractually required contract termination payments, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.There may be an increase in financial institution mergers and acquisitions during periods of economic uncertainty. Such an increase could adversely affect our operating results. Often the newly combined entity seeks to reduce costs by leveraging economies of scale in purchasing, including its check supply contracts. This results in check providers competing intensely on price in order to retain not only their previous business with one of the financial institutions, but also to gain the business of the other party in the merger/acquisition.Although we devote considerable effort toward the development of a competitively-priced, high-quality suite of products and services for the financial services industry, there can be no assurance that significant financial institution clients will be retained or that the impact of the loss of a significant client can be offset through the addition of new clients or by expanded sales to our remaining clients.A deterioration in financial markets and/or in general business conditions in 2015 would negatively affect our operating results.If third party providers of certain significant information technology needs are unable to provide services, our business could be disrupted and the cost of such services could increase.We have entered into agreements with third party providers for information technology services, including telecommunications, network server and transaction processing services. In addition, we have agreements with companies to provide services such as electronic checks and on-line payment solutions. A service provider's ability to provide services could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including unauthorized access, computer viruses, accidental or intentional actions, electrical disruptions, or other conditions. In the event that one or more of our service providers is unable to provide adequate or timely information technology services, our ability to deliver products and services to our customers could be adversely affected. Although we believe we have taken adequate steps to protect our business through contractual arrangements with our service providers, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of disruption in service. Any significant disruption could harm our business, including damage to our brand and loss of customers. Additionally, although we believe that information technology services are available from numerous sources, a failure to perform by one or more of our service providers could cause a disruption in our business while we obtain an alternative source of supply. The use of substitute third party providers could also result in increased expense.The failure to reduce costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Intense competition, declines in the use of checks and business forms, and sluggish economic conditions compel us to continually improve our operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve profitability. We have significantly reduced costs over the past several years, primarily within sales, marketing and our shared services functions, including fulfillment, information technology, real estate, finance and human resources. We realized net cost reductions of approximately $60 million in 2014, as compared to our 2013 results of operations, and we will continue to explore ways to simplify our business processes and reduce our cost and expense structure. Cost reduction initiatives have required and will continue to require up-front expenditures related to items such as redesigning and streamlining processes, consolidating information technology platforms, standardizing technology applications, further enhancing our strategic supplier sourcing arrangements, improving real estate utilization and funding employee severance benefits. We can provide no assurance that we will achieve future cost reductions or that we will do so without incurring unexpected or greater than anticipated expenditures. Moreover, we may find that we are unable to achieve business simplification and/or cost reduction goals without disrupting our business and, as a result, may choose to delay or forgo certain cost reductions as business conditions require. Failure to continue to improve our operating efficiency could adversely affect our business if we are unable to remain competitive.18We may be unable to maintain our licenses to use third party intellectual property on favorable terms, which would affect our ability to offer licensed products to our customers, and thus, adversely affect our operating results.Check designs licensed from third parties account for a portion of our revenue. These license agreements generally average two to three years in duration. There can be no guarantee that such licenses will be available to us indefinitely or under terms that would allow us to continue to sell the licensed products profitably, which would adversely impact our results of operations.A third party could assert that we are infringing its intellectual property rights, which could result in costly litigation or require us to obtain licenses.The e-commerce and print channels are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights, and by increasing litigation based on allegations of infringement. Third parties may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us and/or our clients, which could include aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by non-practicing entities. These claims, whether successful or not, could divert management's attention, result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, or require us to redesign our software or services to avoid infringement. If we fail to obtain a required license or we are unable to design around a third party's patent, we may be unable to effectively conduct certain business activities. Consequently, third party intellectual property claims could result in increased expense or could limit our ability to generate revenue.We are subject to customer payment-related risks, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.We accept payments for our products and services on our websites by a variety of methods, including credit and debit cards, checks and wire transfers. For debit and credit cards, we pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules and requirements, which have changed over time and could change in the future or be reinterpreted to make it more costly, more difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules and requirements, we may be subject to fines and/or higher transaction fees. Any changes could increase our cost of compliance, which would negatively affect our financial results. We could also lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, which would likely result in the loss of customers and the inability to attract new customers.In addition, we may be liable for fraudulent transactions conducted on our websites, such as the use of stolen credit card numbers. To date, we have not incurred significant losses from payment-related fraud, but we continue to face the risk of losses from this type of fraud.If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and other qualified employees, our business could suffer.The success of our business depends on the contributions and abilities of key employees, especially in the areas of sales, marketing, product management, and information technology. If we are unable to retain our existing employees and/or attract qualified personnel, we may not be able to grow and manage our business effectively. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.We may be subject to sales and other taxes which could have an adverse effect on our business.In accordance with existing state and local tax laws, we currently collect sales, use or other similar taxes in state and local jurisdictions where each legal entity has a physical presence. One or more state or local jurisdiction may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state companies which engage in remote or online commerce. Further, tax law and the interpretation of constitutional limitations thereon is subject to change, including pending federal legislation which would allow a state to impose collection requirements on entities which make sales into that state but lack physical presence in that state. In addition, cross-marketing and other affiliate support activities between our direct-to-consumer businesses and any of our other entities which have a physical presence in numerous states, could subject shipments of goods by our direct-to-consumer businesses to sales tax collection under current and/or future state statutes. If one or more state or local jurisdiction successfully asserts that we must collect sales or other taxes in the future beyond our current practices, this could have an adverse effect on our business if it discourages customers from purchasing our products or services. Additionally, we could incur a substantial tax liability if one or more state or local jurisdiction successfully asserts we should have collected sales or other taxes in the past, but did not.We may be unable to protect our rights in intellectual property, which could harm our business and ability to compete.We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret and patent protection, and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks, software and other intellectual property. These protective measures afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products or services which do not infringe on our intellectual property rights. We may be required to spend significant resources to protect our trade secrets and to monitor 19and police our intellectual property rights. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete.We are subject to environmental risks which, if realized, could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Our printing facilities are subject to many federal, state and local regulations designed to protect the environment, including those related to air emissions, wastewater discharge, waste disposal, and remediation of contaminated sites. We have sold former printing facilities to third parties and, in some instances, have agreed to indemnify the buyer of the facility for certain environmental liabilities. Unforeseen conditions at current or former facilities could result in additional liability and expense beyond our insurance coverage.The effects of human activity on global climate change have attracted considerable public and scientific attention, as well as the attention of the United States government. Regulation or some form of legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions is currently being considered in the United States, as well as globally. Increased government regulation to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change could result in increased compliance costs and other financial obligations, which would adversely affect our operating results.A decline in the value of our postretirement medical plan assets and/or a significant change in the number of participants in our postretirement medical plan could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.The fair value of our postretirement medical plan assets is subject to various risks, including credit, interest and overall market volatility risk. If the equity markets were to experience a significant decline in value, the fair value of our plan assets would decrease. This would affect the funded status of our plan and result in higher postretirement benefit expense in the future. Although our obligation is limited to funding benefits as they become payable, future declines in the fair value of our plan assets could also result in the need to contribute increased amounts of cash to fund benefits payable under the plan.There is uncertainty surrounding the impact that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 will have on the number of people participating in our postretirement medical plan. It is unclear at this time whether this legislation will ultimately result in more people electing to participate in our plan. The legislation could also result in fewer people participating in our plan or it could have no impact. For the 2015 plan year, 49% of those eligible to participate in our postretirement medical plan have elected not to participate. If a significant portion of those not participating were to opt-in to our plan, our benefit obligation would increase, which would result in increased expense. Although our plan is currently overfunded, a significant increase in plan participants could also require us to contribute increased amounts of cash to fund benefits payable under the plan"
7,DLX,DELUXE CORP,2014-02-28,"Risk Factors
.Our business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by various risks and uncertainties. These risks include, but are not limited to, the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have disclosed all known material risks. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. You should carefully consider all of these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock or other securities.The following important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the statements we make from time to time regarding our expected future results, including, but not limited to, forecasts regarding estimated revenue, earnings per share or cash provided by operating activities. Any forecast regarding our future performance reflects various assumptions which are subject to significant uncertainties and, as a matter of course, may prove to be incorrect. Further, the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous factors which are beyond our control. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and the variation of actual results or events from such statements may be material and adverse. You are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated statements, and are encouraged to use the entire mix of historical and forward-looking information made available by us, and other information affecting us and our products and services, including the following factors. We may not be successful at implementing our growth strategies.We continue to execute strategies intended to drive sustained revenue and earnings growth, including our focus on increasing marketing solutions and other services revenue, which we believe represents our most significant revenue growth opportunity. We have and will continue to invest in several key enablers to achieve our strategies, including strengthening our portfolio of products and services, enhancing brand awareness and positioning, attracting and retaining customers, growing our distributor, dealer and major accounts networks, improving the customer experience and investing in small to medium-sized acquisitions. Our business strategies could fall short of our expectations for many reasons, including, among others:•the failure to anticipate and overcome obstacles to achieving our goals;•the decision to forgo intended investments because the investments are more costly than we anticipated or because we are unable to devote the necessary operational or financial resources;•the inability to promote, strengthen and protect our brand;•the failure to acquire new customers, retain our current customers and sell more products and services to current and new customers;•unanticipated changes in our business, markets, industry or the competitive landscape; •the failure to generate profitable revenue growth; and•challenging general economic conditions.We can provide no assurance that our growth strategies will be successful either in the short-term or in the long-term, that they will generate a positive return on our investment, or that they will not dilute our operating margins. Additionally, if our strategies are not successful, or if there is market perception that our strategies are not successful, our reputation and brand may be damaged and the price of our shares may decline.We face intense competition in all areas of our business. Although we are one of the leading check printers in the United States, we face considerable competition. In addition to competition from alternative payment methods, we also face intense competition from another large check printer in our traditional financial institution sales channel, from direct mail and internet-based sellers of personal and business checks, and from check printing software vendors. The markets for small business products and services are also intensely competitive, highly fragmented and geographically dispersed. Current and potential competitors include traditional storefront printing companies; office superstores; companies offering website design and hosting; wholesale printers; online printing companies; email marketing services companies; suppliers of custom apparel, promotional products and customized gifts; and numerous internet firms and retailers.We can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. In recent years, our revenue has benefited from price increases in all three of our business segments. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to increase prices in the future while remaining competitive. Continued competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of customers and brand recognition, and an increase in up-front cash payments to 12financial institutions upon contract execution or renewal, all of which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. The check printing portion of the payments industry is mature and, if check usage declines faster than expected, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results. Check printing is, and is expected to continue to be, an essential part of our business. We sell checks for personal and small business use and believe that there will continue to be a substantial demand for these checks for the foreseeable future. However, the total number of checks written in the United States has been in decline since the mid-1990's. According to a Federal Reserve study released in December 2013, the total number of checks written declined 8.8% each year between 2009 and 2012, and we expect the decline to continue. We believe that the number of checks written will continue to fall due to the increasing use of alternative payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, direct deposit, wire transfers and internet-based bill paying services, as well as automated teller machines, which make cash a more readily available alternative. However, the rate and the extent to which alternative payment methods will achieve acceptance and replace checks, whether as a result of legislative developments, personal preference or otherwise, cannot be predicted with certainty. A surge in the popularity of any of these alternative payment methods, or our inability to successfully offset the decline in check usage with other sources of revenue, would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Small Business Services' standardized business forms and related products face technological obsolescence and changing customer preferences.Continual technological improvements provide small business customers with alternative means to enact and record business transactions. For example, because of the lower price and higher performance capabilities of personal computers, printers and mobile devices, small businesses now have alternate means to print many business forms. Additionally, electronic transaction systems, off-the-shelf business software applications and mobile applications have been designed to replace pre-printed business forms products. It is difficult to predict the pace at which these alternative products and services will gain widespread acceptance. If small business preferences change rapidly and we are unable to develop new products and services with comparable profit margins, our results of operations would be adversely affected.If we are unable to attract customers in a cost effective manner, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.We rely on a variety of methods to promote our products and services, including direct mail advertising, e-mail marketing, purchased search results from online search engines, broadcast media, and advertising banners and other online links. The profitability of our Direct Checks segment depends in large part on our ability to secure adequate advertising media placements at acceptable rates. We can provide no assurance regarding the future cost, effectiveness and/or availability of suitable advertising media. Additionally, our Direct Checks segment and portions of our Small Business Services segment have, at times, experienced declines in response rates related to direct mail promotional materials. While we believe that media response rates have declined across a wide variety of products and services, we believe that the declines we have experienced are also attributable to the decline in check usage, the gradual obsolescence of standardized forms products and increasing utilization of e-commerce by both consumers and small businesses. In an attempt to offset these impacts, we continually modify our marketing and sales efforts and have shifted a greater portion of our advertising investment to the internet. Competitive pressure may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the prices of our products and new marketing strategies may not be successful. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to offset a decline in response rates, even with additional marketing and sales efforts. Future legislation could affect our ability to advertise via direct mail or e-mail. Congress has contemplated enacting “anti-spam” legislation in response to consumer complaints about unsolicited e-mail advertisements. If anti-spam legislation is enacted and/or if similar legislation is enacted for direct mail advertisers, we may be unable to sustain our current levels of profitability.In addition to print and e-mail advertising, many customers access our websites through internet search engines. Search engines typically provide two types of search results, algorithmic and purchased listings. Algorithmic listings are not purchased, but are determined and displayed solely by a set of formulas designed by the search engine. Purchased listings can be bought to attract users to our websites. We rely on both algorithmic and purchased listings to attract customers to our websites. Search engines revise their algorithms from time to time in an attempt to optimize their search results listings and to maximize the advertising revenue generated by those listings. If search engines on which we rely for algorithmic listings modify their algorithms, this could result in fewer customers going to our websites. Additionally, one or more of the search engines on which we rely for purchased listings could modify or terminate their relationship with us. As we analyze our overall advertising strategy, we may have to resort to more costly resources to replace lost internet traffic, which would adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the cost of purchased search engine listings could increase as demand for them continues to grow, and further cost increases could negatively affect our profitability.Another trend impacting our business is that the use of smart phone and tablet computing devices is increasing. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Smart Connected Device Tracker report published in September 2013, 87% of connected device sales by 2017 will be tablets and smart phones. As current and potential customers 13increase their use of mobile devices, visits to our websites via traditional computers may decline. Designing and purchasing custom products on mobile devices is more difficult than doing so with a traditional computer due to limited screen sizes and bandwidth. Beyond these difficulties, our technology may not be optimized for mobile devices, and the development of mobile-oriented user interfaces and other technologies is complex. Although we are constantly making investments to update our technology, we cannot predict the success of these investments. If the market shift to mobile devices accelerates faster than we are able to make the necessary changes, we could find it increasingly difficult to attract new and repeat visitors to our websites and convert these visitors to customers, which would result in decreased revenue.  We may not succeed in promoting and strengthening our brand, which could prevent us from acquiring customers and increasing revenue.The success of Small Business Services depends, in part, on our ability to attract new and repeat customers. For this reason, a component of our business strategy is the promotion and strengthening of the Deluxe brand. We believe that the importance of brand recognition is essential for the success of our service offerings because of the level of competition for these services. Customer awareness of our brand, as well as the perceived value of our brand, will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality customer experience. To promote our brand, we have incurred and will continue to incur expense related to advertising and other marketing efforts. We can provide no assurance that we will realize a positive return on this investment.  A component of our brand promotion strategy is establishing a relationship of trust with our customers, which we believe can be achieved by providing a high quality customer experience. We have invested, and will continue to invest, resources in website development, design and technology, and customer service and production operations. Our ability to provide a high quality customer experience is also dependent on external factors including the reliability and performance of our suppliers, telecommunications providers and third-party carriers. If we are unable to provide a high quality customer experience for any reason, our reputation would be harmed and our efforts to develop brand loyalty would be adversely impacted. The failure of our brand promotion activities could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and maintain customer relationships, which would adversely harm our business and results of operations.We face uncertainty regarding the success of recent and future acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results. During 2013, we acquired VerticalResponse, Inc. and substantially all of the assets of Acton Marketing, LLC and Destination Rewards, Inc. During 2012, we acquired OrangeSoda, Inc., and during 2011, we acquired substantially all of the assets of PsPrint, LLC and Banker's Dashboard, LLC. We have invested in acquisitions that offer marketing solutions and other services and extend the range of products and services we offer to financial institutions and small businesses. In addition, we have purchased the operations of several small business distributors with the intention of growing revenue in our Small Business Services distributor channel. The integration of any acquisition involves numerous risks, including: difficulties and/or delays in assimilating operations, technologies and products; failure to realize expected synergies; diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; potential loss of key employees; potential exposure to unknown liabilities; and possible loss of our customers or the customers of the acquired businesses. One or more of these factors could impact our ability to successfully integrate an acquisition and could negatively affect our results of operations.We may continue to invest in small to medium-sized acquisitions. We cannot predict whether suitable acquisition candidates can be acquired on acceptable terms or whether any acquired products, technologies or businesses will contribute to our revenue or earnings to any material extent. Significant acquisitions typically result in additional contingent liabilities and/or additional amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, and thus, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Security breaches involving customer data, or the perception that e-commerce is not secure, could adversely affect our reputation and business.Online commerce and communications depend on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Web-based channels collect customers’ bank account information and bill our customers’ credit card accounts. Within Small Business Services, we provide internet-based marketing services, including web hosting services which we provide directly to small businesses and through wholesale partners. We rely on various security procedures and systems to ensure the secure storage and transmission of data, including encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties, to effect secure transmission of confidential information. Computer networks and the internet are, by nature, vulnerable to unauthorized access. An accidental or willful security breach could result in unauthorized access and/or use of customer data, including consumers' nonpublic personal information. Our security measures could be breached by a third-party action, computer viruses, accidents, employee error or malfeasance, or design flaws in our systems could be exposed and exploited. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Although we encounter threats from time to time, none of which have materially impacted us, and we maintain a system of information security and controls, the impact of a material event could damage our reputation, deter clients and consumers from ordering our products and services, and result in the termination of client contracts, all of which would adversely affect our business and operating results. We could also be exposed to time-consuming and expensive litigation. If we are unsuccessful in 14defending a lawsuit regarding security breaches, we may be forced to pay damages which would have an adverse  effect on our operating results.In addition, there are federal, state and foreign laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity. If we were required to make such a disclosure, it may cause our clients and customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures. Likewise, general publicity regarding security breaches at other companies could lead to the perception among the general public that e-commerce is not secure. This could decrease traffic to our websites and limit future business opportunities.Interruptions to our website operations or information technology systems could damage our reputation and harm our business.The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our information technology systems is critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers. We could experience temporary interruptions in our websites, transaction processing systems, network infrastructure, printing production facilities or customer service operations for a variety of reasons including, among others: human error, software errors, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, fire, flood, extreme weather and other events beyond our control. In addition, our technology, infrastructure and processes may contain undetected errors or design faults which may cause our websites or operating systems to fail. The failure of our systems could interfere with the delivery of services to our customers and impede our customers' ability to do business. In addition to the potential loss of customers, we may be required to incur additional development costs, divert technical and other resources, and we may be the subject of negative publicity and/or liability claims, all of which would adversely affect our reputation and operating results.The cost and availability of materials, delivery services and energy could adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to risks associated with the cost and availability of paper, plastics, ink, other raw materials, delivery services, and energy. There are relatively few paper suppliers. As such, when our suppliers increase paper prices, we may not be able to obtain better pricing from alternative suppliers. Postal rates have increased in recent years and the United States Postal Service (USPS) has incurred significant financial losses. This may result in changes to the breadth and/or frequency of USPS mail delivery services in the future. Also, fuel costs have fluctuated over the past several years, sometimes resulting in fuel surcharges for delivery services. Competitive pressures and/or contractual arrangements may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the price of our products.Paper costs represent a significant portion of our materials cost. Historically, we have not been negatively impacted by paper shortages because of our relationships with paper suppliers. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to purchase sufficient quantities of paper if such a shortage were to occur. Additionally, we depend upon third party providers for delivery services. Events resulting in the inability of these service providers to perform their obligations, such as extended labor strikes, could adversely impact our results of operations by requiring us to secure alternate providers at higher costs.If we do not adapt to changes in technology, our ability to sustain and grow our business could be adversely affected.Changes in the way the internet operates or in how it is used by small businesses and their customers may occur rapidly. The introduction of competing products and services using new technologies, the evolution of industry standards or the introduction of more attractive products or services could make some or all of our web-based products and services less desirable, or even obsolete. To be successful, our web-based products and services must keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards and address the ever-changing and increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers. We could lose current and potential customers if we are unable to develop products and services that meet these changing demands in a timely manner. Additionally, our operating results could be adversely affected if we are required to incur substantial costs to keep pace with technological advances.Asset impairment charges would have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations.Goodwill and an indefinite-lived trade name represented 54% of our total assets as of December 31, 2013. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether the carrying value of these assets is impaired. This analysis considers factors including, but not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions. For example, if our stock price were to decline for a sustained period, if a downturn in economic conditions were to negatively affect our actual and forecasted operating results, or if order volume declines for our Direct Checks segment were to accelerate, these situations could indicate a decline in the fair value of one or more of our reporting units. This may require us to record an impairment charge for a portion of goodwill and/or our indefinite-lived trade name. We are also required to assess the carrying value of other long-lived assets, including intangibles and assets held for sale. If we were required to record an asset impairment charge for any reason, our consolidated results of operations would be adversely affected.15Governmental regulation could limit or harm our business. We are subject to regulations implementing the privacy and information security requirements of the federal financial modernization law known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, as well as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and other federal and foreign regulation and state law regarding the protection of consumer information. These laws and regulations require us to develop, implement and maintain policies and procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of consumers' nonpublic personal information. We are also subject to additional requirements in certain of our contracts with financial institution clients, which are often more restrictive than the regulations, as well as confidentiality clauses in certain of our communication service provider contracts that cover small businesses’ customer information. These regulations and agreements limit our ability to use or disclose nonpublic personal information for other than the purposes originally intended, which could limit business opportunities. The complexity of compliance with these regulations may also increase the cost of doing business.  Due to our increasing use of the internet for sales and marketing, laws specifically governing the internet, e-commerce, behavioral advertising and email marketing may have an impact on our business. Existing and future laws governing issues such as privacy, consumer protection or commercial email may impede the growth of the internet and our ability to market and provide our products and services. It is not always clear how existing laws governing these and other issues apply to the internet and e-commerce, as the vast majority of applicable laws were adopted before the advent of the internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by e-commerce. Those laws that do reference the internet, such as the U.S. CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act, are only beginning to be interpreted by the courts. More restrictive legislation, such as new privacy laws, search engine marketing restrictions or “anti-spam” regulations, could decrease traffic to our websites, decrease marketing opportunities and increase the cost of obtaining new customers. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ""Act"") was enacted in 2010. The Act implements changes that affect the oversight and supervision of financial institutions, creates a new agency responsible for implementing and enforcing compliance with consumer financial laws and introduces more stringent regulatory capital requirements. The full impact of the Act and/or any additional related regulatory changes remains unclear due to the pace at which formal rulemaking is finalized. It is likely that the Act has and will have a negative impact on the profitability of our financial institution clients as they incur costs to comply with the new regulations. In spite of these additional costs, financial institutions may seek to maintain the profits they have historically generated, and they may put significant pricing pressure on their suppliers, including their check and service providers. The increase in cost and profit pressure may also lead to further consolidation of financial institutions. Additionally, the Act gave the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) the authority to pursue financial institutions engaged in unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. The CFPB’s rule-making and enforcement power may also extend to financial institutions’ service providers. This has made some financial institutions wary of offering add-on services, such as fraud/identity protection or expedited check delivery, to their customers. It would have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we were unable to market such services to consumers or small businesses through our financial institution clients.  Economic conditions could continue to have an adverse effect on our operating results in each of our business segments.Domestic and global economic conditions have affected and, most likely, will continue to affect our results of operations and financial position. Current and future economic conditions that affect consumer and business spending, including unemployment levels, the availability of credit and small business confidence, as well as the financial condition and growth prospects of our customers, may adversely affect our business and results of operations. A significant portion of our business relies on small business spending. As such, the level of small business confidence and the rate of small business formations and closures impact our business. In recent years, below average small business optimism, as well as declines in small business formations and increases in small business closures, negatively impacted our results of operations and/or our growth opportunities in Small Business Services. We believe small businesses are more likely to be significantly affected by economic downturns than larger, more established companies. During a sluggish economy, it may be more difficult for small businesses to obtain credit and small businesses may choose to spend their limited funds on items other than our products and services. Within our personal check printing businesses, consumer spending, employment levels and housing stock impact the number of checks consumers use. Weak growth in consumer spending during 2013, along with only modest private sector growth in employment, continued to negatively impact our personal check businesses. Partially offsetting the negative impact of employment levels and consumer spending in 2013 was an improvement in housing stock. An increase in housing stock has a positive impact on the number of checks purchased, as new households typically are in need of new checks. We cannot predict whether these economic trends will improve, stay the same or worsen in the near future.As a result of global economic conditions in recent years, a number of financial institutions sought additional capital, merged with other financial institutions and, in some cases, failed. This turmoil in the financial services industry affected and may continue to affect our results of operations in a number of ways. Our experience indicates that financial institution failures, as well as the consolidation of companies within the financial services industry, may have caused some larger financial institutions to lose customers, and this trend appears to be continuing. A study published by cg42, a management consulting firm, in July 2013 indicated that 26% of the top 10 retail banks’ customers expressed that they are frustrated with their primary banks, and 15% of these customers are actively pursuing a change in their banking relationship. The loss of customers for some financial institutions may reduce our order volume when those customers 16move their accounts to financial institutions that are not our clients, or customers may reduce or delay their check purchases while they are considering changing banks.The failure of one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or large portions of our customer base, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to the possibility of losing a significant client, the inability to recover contract acquisition payments made to one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or the inability to collect accounts receivable or contractually required contract termination payments, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.There may be an increase in financial institution mergers and acquisitions during periods of economic uncertainty. Such an increase could adversely affect our operating results. Often the newly combined entity seeks to reduce costs by leveraging economies of scale in purchasing, including its check supply contracts. This results in check providers competing intensely on price in order to retain not only their previous business with one of the financial institutions, but also to gain the business of the other party in the merger/acquisition.Although we devote considerable effort toward the development of a competitively-priced, high-quality suite of products and services for the financial services industry, there can be no assurance that significant financial institution clients will be retained or that the impact of the loss of a significant client can be offset through the addition of new clients or by expanded sales to our remaining clients. The severity and length of the present sluggish global economy is unknown. A further deterioration in financial markets and in general business conditions in 2014 could negatively affect our operating results.The failure to reduce costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Intense competition, declines in the use of checks and business forms, and sluggish economic conditions compel us to continually improve our operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve profitability. We have significantly reduced costs over the past several years, primarily within sales, marketing and our shared services functions, including fulfillment, information technology, real estate, finance and human resources. We realized net cost reductions of approximately $55 million in 2013, as compared to our 2012 results of operations, and we will continue to explore ways to simplify our business processes and reduce our cost and expense structure. Cost reduction initiatives have required and will continue to require up-front expenditures related to items such as redesigning and streamlining processes, consolidating information technology platforms, standardizing technology applications, improving real estate utilization and funding employee severance benefits. We can provide no assurance that we will achieve future cost reductions or that we will do so without incurring unexpected or greater than anticipated expenditures. Moreover, we may find that we are unable to achieve business simplification and/or cost reduction goals without disrupting our business and, as a result, may choose to delay or forgo certain cost reductions as business conditions require. Failure to continue to improve our operating efficiency could adversely affect our business if we are unable to remain competitive.We may be unable to maintain our licenses to use third party intellectual property on favorable terms, which would affect our ability to offer licensed products to our customers, and thus, adversely affect our operating results.Check designs licensed from third parties account for a portion of our revenue. These license agreements generally average two to three years in duration. There can be no guarantee that such licenses will be available to us indefinitely or under terms that would allow us to continue to sell the licensed products profitably, which would adversely impact our results of operations.A third party could assert that we are infringing its intellectual property rights, which could result in costly litigation or require us to obtain licenses.The e-commerce channel is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights, and by increasing litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Third parties may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us, which could include aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by non-practicing entities. These claims, whether successful or not, could divert management's attention, result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, or require us to redesign our software or services to avoid infringement. If we fail to obtain a required license or we are unable to design around a third party's patent, we may be unable to effectively conduct certain business activities. Consequently, third party intellectual property claims could result in increased expense or could limit our ability to generate revenue.If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and other qualified employees, our business could suffer.The success of our business depends on the contributions and abilities of key employees, especially in the areas of sales, marketing, product management, and information technology. If we are unable to retain our existing employees and attract qualified personnel, we may not be able to grow and manage our business effectively. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.17We may be subject to sales and other taxes which could have an adverse effect on our business. In accordance with existing state and local tax laws, we currently collect sales, use or other similar taxes in state and local jurisdictions where each legal entity has a physical presence. One or more state or local jurisdiction may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state companies which engage in remote or online commerce. Further, tax law and the interpretation of constitutional limitations thereon is subject to change, including pending federal legislation which would allow a state to impose collection requirements on entities which make sales into that state but lack physical presence in that state. In addition, cross-marketing and other affiliate support activities between our direct-to-consumer businesses and any of our other entities which have a physical presence in numerous states, could subject shipments of goods by our direct-to-consumer businesses to sales tax collection under current and/or future state statutes. If one or more state or local jurisdiction successfully asserts that we must collect sales or other taxes in the future beyond our current practices, this could have an adverse effect on our business if it discourages customers from purchasing our products or services. Additionally, we could incur a substantial tax liability if one or more state or local jurisdiction successfully asserts we should have collected sales or other taxes in the past, but did not.If third party providers of certain significant information technology needs are unable to provide services, our business could be disrupted and the cost of such services could increase. We have entered into agreements with third party providers for information technology services, including telecommunications, network server and transaction processing services. In addition, we have agreements with companies to provide services such as electronic checks and on-line payment solutions. A service provider's ability to provide services could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including unauthorized access, computer viruses, accidental or intentional actions, electrical disruptions, or other extreme conditions. In the event that one or more of our service providers is unable to provide adequate or timely information technology services, our ability to deliver products and services to our customers could be adversely affected. Although we believe we have taken adequate steps to protect our business through contractual arrangements with our service providers, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of disruption in service. Any significant disruption could harm our business, including damage to our brand and loss of customers. Additionally, although we believe that information technology services are available from numerous sources, a failure to perform by one or more of our service providers could cause a disruption in our business while we obtain an alternative source of supply. The use of substitute third party providers could also result in increased expense. A decline in the value of our postretirement medical plan assets and/or a significant change in the number of participants in our postretirement medical plan could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.The fair value of our postretirement medical plan assets is subject to various risks, including credit, interest and overall market volatility risk. If the equity markets were to experience a significant decline in value, the fair value of our plan assets would decrease. This would affect the funded status of our plan and result in higher postretirement benefit expense in the future. Although our obligation is limited to funding benefits as they become payable, future declines in the fair value of our plan assets would also result in the need to contribute increased amounts of cash to fund benefits payable under the plan.There is uncertainty surrounding the impact that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 will have on the number of people participating in our postretirement medical plan. It is unclear at this time whether this legislation will result in more people electing to participate in our plan. The legislation could also result in fewer people participating in our plan or it could have no impact. For the 2014 plan year, 47% of those eligible to participate in our postretirement medical plan had elected not to participate. If a significant portion of those not participating were to opt-in to our plan, our benefit obligation would increase, which would result in increased expense. Although our plan is currently overfunded, a significant increase in plan participants could also require us to contribute increased amounts of cash to fund benefits payable under the plan. We may be unable to protect our rights in intellectual property, which could harm our business and ability to compete.We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret and patent protection, and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks, software and other intellectual property. These protective measures afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products and services which do not infringe on our intellectual property rights. We may be required to spend significant resources to protect our trade secrets and to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete.We are subject to environmental risks which, if realized, could have an adverse impact on our operating results. Our printing facilities are subject to many federal and state regulations designed to protect the environment. We have sold former printing facilities to third parties and, in some instances, have agreed to indemnify the buyer of the facility for certain environmental liabilities. Unforeseen conditions at current or former facilities could result in additional liability and expense beyond our insurance coverage.18"
5,DLX,DELUXE CORP,2013-02-22,"Risk Factors
.Our business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by various risks and uncertainties. These risks include, but are not limited to, the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have disclosed all known material risks. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. You should carefully consider all of these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock or other securities.The following important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the statements we make from time to time regarding our expected future results, including, but not limited to, forecasts regarding estimated revenue, earnings per share or cash provided by operating activities. Any forecast regarding our future performance reflects various assumptions which are subject to significant uncertainties and, as a matter of course, may prove to be incorrect. Further, the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous factors which are beyond our control. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and the variation of actual results or events from such statements may be material and adverse. You are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated statements, and are encouraged to use the entire mix of historical and forward-looking information made available by us, and other information affecting us and our products and services, including the following factors. We may not be successful at implementing our growth strategies.We continue to execute strategies intended to drive sustained revenue and earnings growth. We are continuing to invest in several key enablers to achieve our strategies, including strengthening our portfolio of products and services, attracting new customers, improving our use of technology, growing our distributor and major accounts networks, and enhancing brand awareness and positioning. Additionally, we expect to drive growth from our marketing solutions and other services offerings. The market for many of our services is relatively new and untested, and small businesses and financial institutions may be slow to adopt these services. If the market for our services fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, or if our services fail to achieve widespread acceptance, our operating results would be negatively affected.11All of our growth initiatives have required and will continue to require investment. Business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, may impact the success of our growth strategies. We can provide no assurance that our growth strategies will be successful either in the short-term or in the long-term, that they will generate a positive return on our investment, or that they will not dilute our operating margins.We face intense competition in all areas of our business. Although we are one of the leading check printers in the United States, we face considerable competition. In addition to competition from alternative payment methods, we also face intense competition from another large check printer in our traditional financial institution sales channel, from direct mail sellers of personal checks, from sellers of business checks and forms, from check printing software vendors and from internet-based sellers of our products and services to individuals and small businesses. Low price, high volume office supply chain stores offer standardized business forms, checks and related products to small businesses. Our marketing solutions and other services offerings also face intense competition, and with relatively low barriers to entry for the types of services we offer, we expect the intensity of competition to increase in the future from both established and emerging companies. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. In recent years, our revenue has benefited from price increases in all three of our businesses. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to increase prices in the future while remaining competitive. Continued competition could also result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of customers and an increase in up-front cash payments to financial institutions upon contract execution or renewal, all of which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. The check printing portion of the payments industry is mature and, if check usage declines faster than expected, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results. Check printing is, and is expected to continue to be, an essential part of our business. We sell checks for personal and small business use and believe that there will continue to be a substantial demand for these checks for the foreseeable future. However, the total number of checks written in the United States has been in decline since the mid-1990's. According to a Federal Reserve study released in December 2010, the most recent information available, the total number of checks written declined 6.1% each year between 2006 and 2009, and we expect this trend to continue. We believe that the number of checks written will continue to decline due to the increasing use of alternative payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, automated teller machines, direct deposit, wire transfers and internet-based bill paying services. However, the rate and the extent to which alternative payment methods will achieve acceptance and replace checks, whether as a result of legislative developments, personal preference or otherwise, cannot be predicted with certainty. A surge in the popularity of any of these alternative payment methods, or our inability to successfully offset the decline in check usage with other sources of revenue, would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Small Business Services' standardized business forms and related products face technological obsolescence and changing customer preferences.Continual technological improvements provide small business customers with alternative means to enact and record business transactions. For example, because of the lower price and higher performance capabilities of personal computers, printers and mobile devices, small businesses now have alternate means to print many business forms. Additionally, electronic transaction systems, off-the-shelf business software applications and mobile applications have been designed to replace pre-printed business forms products. It is difficult to predict the pace at which these alternative products and services will gain widespread acceptance. If small business preferences change rapidly and we are unable to develop new products and services with comparable profit margins, our results of operations would be adversely affected.If we are unable to attract customers in a cost effective manner, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.We rely on a variety of methods to promote our products and services, including direct mail advertising, e-mail marketing and purchased search results from online search engines. The profitability of our Direct Checks segment depends in large part on our ability to secure adequate advertising media placements at acceptable rates. We can provide no assurance regarding the future cost, effectiveness and/or availability of suitable advertising media. Additionally, our Direct Checks segment and portions of our Small Business Services segment have, at times, experienced declines in response rates related to direct mail promotional materials. While we believe that media response rates have declined across a wide variety of products and services, we believe that the declines we have experienced are also attributable to the decline in check usage, the gradual obsolescence of standardized forms products and increasing utilization of e-commerce by both consumers and small businesses. In an attempt to offset these impacts, we continually modify our marketing and sales efforts and have shifted a greater portion of our advertising investment to the internet. Competitive pressure may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the prices of our products and new marketing strategies may not be successful. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to offset a decline in response rates, even with additional marketing and sales efforts. 12Future legislation could affect our ability to advertise via direct mail or e-mail. Congress has contemplated enacting “anti-spam” legislation in response to consumer complaints about unsolicited e-mail advertisements. If anti-spam legislation is enacted and/or if similar legislation is enacted for direct mail advertisers, we may be unable to sustain our current levels of profitability.In addition to print and e-mail advertising, many customers access our websites through internet search engines. Search engines typically provide two types of search results, algorithmic and purchased listings. Algorithmic listings are not purchased, but are determined and displayed solely by a set of formulas designed by the search engine. Purchased listings can be bought to attract users to our websites. We rely on both algorithmic and purchased listings to attract customers to our websites. Search engines revise their algorithms from time to time in an attempt to optimize their search results listings and to maximize the advertising revenue generated by those listings. If search engines on which we rely for algorithmic listings modify their algorithms, this could result in fewer customers going to our websites. Additionally, one or more of the search engines on which we rely for purchased listings could modify or terminate their relationship with us. As we analyze our overall advertising strategy, we may have to resort to more costly resources to replace lost internet traffic, which would adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the cost of purchased search engine listings could increase as demand for them continues to grow, and further cost increases could negatively affect our profitability.We may not succeed in promoting and strengthening our brand, which could prevent us from acquiring customers and increasing revenue.The success of Small Business Services depends, in part, on our ability to attract new and repeat customers. For this reason, a component of our business strategy is the promotion and strengthening of the Deluxe brand. We believe that the importance of brand recognition is essential for the success of our service offerings because of the level of competition for these services. Customer awareness of our brand, as well as the perceived value of our brand, will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality customer experience. To promote our brand, we have incurred and will continue to incur expense related to advertising and other marketing efforts. We can provide no assurance that we will realize a positive return on this investment.  A component of our brand promotion strategy is establishing a relationship of trust with our customers, which we believe can be achieved by providing a high quality customer experience. We have invested, and will continue to invest, resources in website development, technology and customer service operations. Our ability to provide a high quality customer experience is also dependent on external factors including the reliability and performance of our suppliers and telecommunications providers. If we are unable to provide a high quality customer experience for any reason, our reputation would be harmed and our efforts to develop brand loyalty would be adversely impacted. The failure of our brand promotion activities could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and maintain customer relationships, which would adversely harm our business and results of operations.Economic conditions could continue to have an adverse effect on our operating results in each of our business segments.Domestic and global economic conditions have affected and, most likely, will continue to affect our results of operations and financial position. Current and future economic conditions that affect consumer and business spending, including unemployment levels, the availability of credit and small business confidence, as well as the financial condition and growth prospects of our customers, may adversely affect our business and results of operations. A significant portion of our business relies on small business spending. As such, the level of small business confidence and the rate of small business formations and closures impact our business. Continued below average small business optimism, as well as declines in small business formations and increases in small business closures in recent years, have negatively impacted our results of operations in Small Business Services. However, according to information published by the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy in September 2012, small business formations were up slightly in 2011 as compared to 2010. We believe small businesses are more likely to be significantly affected by economic downturns than larger, more established companies. During a sluggish economy, it may be more difficult for small businesses to obtain credit and small businesses may choose to spend their limited funds on items other than our products and services. Within our personal check printing businesses, consumer spending and employment levels impact the number of checks consumers use. Weak growth in consumer spending, along with only modest private sector growth in employment during 2012, continued to impact our personal check businesses. We cannot predict whether these negative economic trends will improve or worsen in the near future.As a result of global economic conditions in recent years, a number of financial institutions sought additional capital, merged with other financial institutions and, in some cases, failed. This turmoil in the financial services industry affected and may continue to affect our results of operations in a number of ways. •Our experience indicates that financial institution failures, as well as the consolidation of companies within the financial services industry, caused some larger financial institutions to lose customers. A report issued by Javelin Strategy and Research in June 2012 reported that approximately 11% of consumers surveyed indicated they were considering 13switching their primary financial institution. This percentage was somewhat higher for certain national financial institutions. The loss of customers for some financial institutions may reduce our order volume when those customers move their accounts to financial institutions that are not our clients, or they may reduce or delay their check purchases.•The failure of one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or large portions of our customer base, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to the possibility of losing a significant client, the inability to recover contract acquisition payments made to one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or the inability to collect accounts receivable or contractually required contract termination payments, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.•There may be an increase in financial institution mergers and acquisitions during periods of economic uncertainty. Such an increase could adversely affect our operating results. Often the newly combined entity seeks to reduce costs by leveraging economies of scale in purchasing, including its check supply contracts. This results in check providers competing intensely on price in order to retain not only their previous business with one of the financial institutions, but also to gain the business of the other party in the merger/acquisition.Although we devote considerable effort toward the development of a competitively-priced, high-quality suite of products and services for the financial services industry, there can be no assurance that significant financial institution clients will be retained or that the impact of the loss of a significant client can be offset through the addition of new clients or by expanded sales to our remaining clients. The severity and length of the present sluggish global economy is unknown. A further deterioration in financial markets and in general business conditions in 2013 could negatively affect our operating results.The failure to reduce costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Intense competition, declines in the use of checks and business forms, and sluggish economic conditions compel us to continually improve our operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve profitability. We have significantly reduced costs over the past several years, primarily within sales, marketing and our shared services functions, including fulfillment, information technology, real estate, finance and human resources. We realized net cost reductions of approximately $50 million in 2012, as compared to our 2011 results of operations, and we will continue to explore ways to simplify our business processes and reduce our cost and expense structure. Cost reduction initiatives have required and will continue to require up-front expenditures related to items such as redesigning and streamlining processes, consolidating information technology platforms, standardizing technology applications, improving real estate utilization and funding employee severance benefits. We can provide no assurance that we will achieve future cost reductions or that we will do so without incurring unexpected or greater than anticipated expenditures. Moreover, we may find that we are unable to achieve business simplification and/or cost reduction goals without disrupting our business and, as a result, may choose to delay or forgo certain cost reductions as business conditions require. Failure to continue to improve our operating efficiency could adversely affect our business if we are unable to remain competitive.Security breaches involving customer data, or the perception that e-commerce is not secure, could adversely affect our reputation and business.Online commerce and communications depend on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Web-based channels collect customer's bank account information and bill our customer's credit card accounts. Within Small Business Services, we provide internet-based marketing services, including web hosting services which we provide directly to small businesses and through wholesale partners. We rely on various security procedures and systems to ensure the secure storage and transmission of data, including encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties, to effect secure transmission of confidential information. Computer networks and the internet are, by nature, vulnerable to unauthorized access. An accidental or willful security breach could result in unauthorized access and/or use of customer data, including consumers' nonpublic personal information. Our security measures could be breached by a third-party action, computer viruses, accidents, employee error or malfeasance, or design flaws in our systems could be exposed and exploited. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. If a third party obtains unauthorized access to any of our customers' data, our reputation could be damaged, clients and consumers could be deterred from ordering our products and services, and client contracts could be terminated, all of which would adversely affect our business and operating results. We could also be exposed to time-consuming and expensive litigation. If we are unsuccessful in defending a lawsuit regarding security breaches, we may be forced to pay damages which would have an adverse affect on our operating results.In addition, there are federal, state and foreign laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity. If we were required to make such a disclosure, it may cause our clients and customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures. Likewise, general publicity regarding security breaches at other companies could lead to the perception among the general public that e-commerce is not secure. This could decrease traffic to our websites and limit future business opportunities.14We face uncertainty regarding the success of recent and future acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results. During 2012, we acquired OrangeSoda, Inc. During 2011, we acquired substantially all of the assets of PsPrint, LLC and Banker's Dashboard, LLC, and during 2010, we acquired Custom Direct, Inc. and substantially all of the assets of Cornerstone Customer Solutions, LLC. We have invested in acquisitions that offer marketing solutions and other services, extend the range of products and services we offer to financial institutions and small businesses, and extend our direct-to-consumer offerings. The integration of any acquisition involves numerous risks, including: difficulties in assimilating operations and products; failure to realize expected synergies; diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; potential loss of key employees; potential exposure to unknown liabilities; and possible loss of our customers or the customers of the acquired businesses. One or more of these factors could impact our ability to successfully integrate an acquisition and could negatively affect our results of operations.We may continue to invest in small to medium-sized acquisitions. We cannot predict whether suitable acquisition candidates can be acquired on acceptable terms or whether any acquired products, technologies or businesses will contribute to our revenue or earnings to any material extent. Significant acquisitions typically result in additional contingent liabilities or debt and/or additional amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, and thus, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The cost and availability of materials, delivery services and energy could adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to risks associated with the cost and availability of paper, plastics, ink, other raw materials, delivery services, and energy. There are relatively few paper suppliers. As such, when our suppliers increase paper prices, we may not be able to obtain better pricing from alternative suppliers. Postal rates have increased in recent years and the United States Postal Service (USPS) has incurred significant financial losses. This has resulted in an announcement by the USPS that Saturday mail delivery will stop in August 2013 and may result in additional changes to the breadth and/or frequency of USPS mail delivery services in the future. Also, fuel costs have fluctuated over the past several years. Competitive pressures and/or contractual arrangements may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the price of our products.Paper costs represent a significant portion of our materials cost. Historically, we have not been negatively impacted by paper shortages because of our relationships with paper suppliers. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to purchase sufficient quantities of paper if such a shortage were to occur. Additionally, we depend upon third party providers for delivery services. Events resulting in the inability of these service providers to perform their obligations, such as extended labor strikes, could adversely impact our results of operations by requiring us to secure alternate providers at higher costs.Interruptions to our website operations or information technology systems could damage our reputation and harm our business.The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our information technology systems is critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers. We could experience temporary interruptions in our websites, transaction processing systems, network infrastructure, printing production facilities or customer service operations for a variety of reasons, including human error, software errors, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, fire, flood, extreme weather and other events beyond our control. In addition, our technology, infrastructure and processes may contain undetected errors or design faults which may cause our websites or operating systems to fail. The failure of our systems could interfere with the delivery of services to our customers and impede our customers' ability to do business. In addition to the potential loss of customers, we may be required to incur additional development costs, divert technical and other resources, and we may be the subject of negative publicity and/or liability claims, all of which would adversely affect our reputation and operating results.If we do not adapt to changes in technology, our ability to sustain and grow our business could be adversely affected.Changes in the way the internet operates or in how it is used by small businesses and their customers may occur rapidly. The introduction of competing products and services using new technologies, the evolution of industry standards or the introduction of more attractive products or services could make some or all of our web-based products and services less desirable, or even obsolete. To be successful, our web-based products and services must keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards and address the ever-changing and increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers. We could lose current and potential customers if we are unable to develop products and services to compete with new technologies. Additionally, our operating results could be adversely affected if we are required to incur substantial costs to keep pace with technological advances.15Weak economic conditions could result in additional asset impairment charges.During 2009, declines in our stock price, as well as the impact of the economic downturn on our expected operating results, led to asset impairment charges related to goodwill and an indefinite-lived trade name in our Small Business Services segment. If our stock price declines in the future for a sustained period or if a further downturn in economic conditions negatively affects our actual and forecasted operating results, it may be indicative of a decline in our fair value and may require us to record an impairment charge for a portion of goodwill and/or our indefinite-lived trade name or other assets. Such a charge would have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.Declines in the equity markets could affect the value of our postretirement benefit plan assets, which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.The fair value of our postretirement benefit plan assets is subject to various risks, including credit, interest and overall market volatility risk. During 2008, the equity markets experienced a significant decline in value, resulting in a significant decrease in the fair value of our plan assets. This materially affected the funded status of our plan and resulted in higher postretirement benefit expense in 2009. The fair value of our plan assets did recover in subsequent years. Although our obligation is limited to funding benefits as they become payable, future declines in the fair value of our plan assets would result in increased expense, as well as the need to contribute increased amounts of cash to fund benefits payable under the plan.We may be unable to maintain our licenses to use third party intellectual property on favorable terms, which would affect our ability to offer licensed products to our customers, and thus, adversely affect our operating results.Check designs licensed from third parties account for a portion of our revenue. These license agreements generally average two to three years in duration. There can be no guarantee that such licenses will be available to us indefinitely or under terms that would allow us to continue to sell the licensed products profitably, which would adversely impact our results of operations.If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and other qualified employees, our business could suffer.Our success at efforts to grow our business depends on the contributions and abilities of key employees, especially in the areas of sales, marketing and product management. If we are unable to retain our existing employees and attract qualified personnel, we may not be able to grow and manage our business effectively. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.Governmental regulation could limit or harm our business. We are subject to regulations implementing the privacy and information security requirements of the federal financial modernization law known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, as well as other federal and foreign regulation and state law regarding the protection of consumer information. These laws and regulations require us to develop, implement and maintain policies and procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of consumers' nonpublic personal information. We are also subject to additional requirements in certain of our contracts with financial institution clients, which are often more restrictive than the regulations, as well as confidentiality clauses in certain of our telecommunications contracts that cover small businesses’ customer information. These regulations and agreements limit our ability to use or disclose nonpublic personal information for other than the purposes originally intended, which could limit business opportunities. The complexity of compliance with these regulations may also increase the cost of doing business.  Due to our increasing use of the internet for sales and marketing, laws specifically governing the internet, e-commerce and email marketing may have an impact on our business. Existing and future laws governing issues such as privacy, consumer protection or commercial email may impede the growth of the internet and our ability to market and provide our products and services. It is not always clear how existing laws governing these and other issues apply to the internet and e-commerce, as the vast majority of applicable laws were adopted before the advent of the internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by e-commerce. Those laws that do reference the internet, such as the U.S. CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, are only beginning to be interpreted by the courts. More restrictive legislation, such as new privacy laws or “anti-spam” regulations, could decrease traffic to our websites, decrease marketing opportunities and increase the cost of obtaining new customers. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ""Act"") was enacted in 2010. The Act implements changes that, among other things, affect the oversight and supervision of financial institutions, create a new agency responsible for implementing and enforcing compliance with consumer financial laws and introduce more stringent regulatory capital requirements. The full impact of the Act and/or any additional related regulatory changes remains unclear. It is likely that the Act has and will have a negative impact on the profitability of our financial institution clients as they incur costs to comply with the new regulations. In spite of these additional costs, financial institutions may seek to maintain the profits they have historically generated, and they may put significant pricing pressure on their suppliers, including their check providers. The increase in cost and profit pressure may also lead to further consolidation of financial institutions. Additionally, the Act gave the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) the authority to pursue financial institutions engaged in unfair, deceptive or abusive 16practices. This has made some financial institutions wary of offering add-on services, such as fraud/identity protection or expedited check delivery, to their customers, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we are unable to market such services through our financial institution clients.  We may be subject to sales and other taxes which could have an adverse effect on our business. In accordance with existing state and local tax laws, we currently collect sales, use or other similar taxes in state and local jurisdictions where each legal entity has a physical presence. One or more state or local jurisdiction may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state companies which engage in remote or online commerce. Further, tax law and the interpretation of constitutional limitations thereon is subject to change, including pending federal legislation which would allow a state to impose collection requirements on entities which make sales into that state but lack physical presence in that state. In addition, cross-marketing and other affiliate support activities between our direct-to-consumer businesses and any of our other entities which have a physical presence in numerous states, could subject shipments of goods by our direct-to-consumer businesses to sales tax collection under current and/or future state statutes. If one or more state or local jurisdiction successfully asserts that we must collect sales or other taxes in the future beyond our current practices, this could have an adverse affect on our business if it discourages customers from purchasing our products or services. Additionally, we could incur a substantial tax liability if one or more state or local jurisdiction successfully asserts we should have collected sales or other taxes in the past, but did not.If third party providers of certain significant information technology needs are unable to provide services, our business could be disrupted and the cost of such services could increase. We have entered into agreements with third party providers for information technology services, including telecommunications, network server and transaction processing services. A service provider's ability to provide services could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including unauthorized access, computer viruses, accidental or intentional actions, electrical disruptions, or other extreme conditions. In the event that one or more of our service providers is unable to provide adequate or timely information technology services, our ability to deliver products and services to our customers could be adversely affected. Although we believe we have taken adequate steps to protect our business through contractual arrangements with our service providers, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of disruption in service. Additionally, although we believe that information technology services are available from numerous sources, a failure to perform by one or more of our service providers could cause a disruption in our business while we obtain an alternative source of supply. The use of substitute third party providers could also result in increased expense. We may be unable to protect our rights in intellectual property, which could harm our business and ability to compete.We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret and patent protection, and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks, software and other intellectual property. These protective measures afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products and services which do not infringe on our intellectual property rights. We may be required to spend significant resources to protect our trade secrets and to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete.A third party could assert that we are infringing its intellectual property, which could result in costly litigation or require us to obtain licenses.The e-commerce channel is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights, and by increasing litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Third parties may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us, which could include aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by non-practicing entities. These claims, whether successful or not, could divert management's attention, result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, or require us to redesign our software or services to avoid infringement. If we fail to obtain a required license or we are unable to design around a third party's patent, we may be unable to effectively conduct certain business activities. Consequently, third party intellectual property claims could result in increased expense or could limit our ability to generate revenue.We are subject to environmental risks which, if realized, could have an adverse impact on our operating results. Our printing facilities are subject to many federal and state regulations designed to protect the environment. We have sold former printing facilities to third parties and, in some instances, have agreed to indemnify the buyer of the facility for certain environmental liabilities. Unforeseen conditions at current or former facilities could result in additional liability and expense beyond our insurance coverage.17"

.Our business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by various risks and uncertainties. These risks include, but are not limited to, the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have disclosed all known material risks. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. You should carefully consider all of these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock or other securities.The following important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the statements we make from time to time regarding our expected future results, including, but not limited to, forecasts regarding estimated revenue, earnings per share or cash provided by operating activities. Any forecast regarding our future performance reflects various assumptions which are subject to significant uncertainties and, as a matter of course, may prove to be incorrect. Further, the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous factors which are beyond our control. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and the variation of actual results or events from such statements may be material and adverse. You are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated statements, and are encouraged to use the entire mix of historical and forward-looking information made available by us, and other information affecting us and our products and services, including the following factors.Economic conditions and turmoil in the financial services industry could continue to have an adverse effect on our operating results.Local, national and worldwide economic conditions have affected and, most likely, will continue to affect our results of operations and financial position. Current and future economic conditions that affect consumer and business spending, including unemployment levels, inflation and the availability of credit, as well as the financial condition and growth prospects of our customers, may continue to adversely affect our business and results of operations. A significant portion of our business relies on small business spending. As such, the rate of small business formations and the level of small business confidence impact our business. Continued below average small business optimism, as well as declines in small business formations, negatively impacted our results of operations in Small Business Services in 2010 and 2009. Small businesses typically have more limited budgets and are more likely to be significantly affected by economic downturns than larger, more established companies. During economic downturns, small businesses may choose to spend their limited funds on items other than our products and services. Within our personal check printing businesses, consumer spending and employment levels impact the number of checks consumers use. Slow consumer spending growth, along with only modest private sector growth in employment during 2010, negatively impacted our personal check businesses. We cannot predict whether these negative economic trends will improve or worsen in the near future. A further downturn in general economic conditions could result in additional declines in our revenue and profitability.As a result of global economic conditions in recent years, a number of financial institutions sought additional capital, merged with other financial institutions and, in some cases, failed. This turmoil in the financial services industry affected and may continue to affect our results of operations in a number of ways. Our experience indicates that financial institution failures, as well    12Table of Contents as the consolidation of companies within the financial services industry, have caused some larger financial institutions to lose customers. This reduces our order volume when those customers move their accounts to financial institutions that are not our clients or they reduce or delay their check purchases. The failure of one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or large portions of our customer base, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to the possibility of losing a significant client, the inability to recover contract acquisition payments made to one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or the inability to collect accounts receivable or contractually required contract termination payments, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations. Also, there may be an increase in financial institution mergers and acquisitions during periods of economic uncertainty. Such an increase could adversely affect our operating results. Often the newly combined entity seeks to reduce costs by leveraging economies of scale in purchasing, including its check supply contracts. This results in check providers competing intensely on price in order to retain not only their previous business with one of the financial institutions, but also to gain the business of the other party in the merger/acquisition. Financial institution mergers and acquisitions can also impact the duration of our contracts. Normally, our financial institution contracts have terms of three to six years. However, contracts may be renegotiated or bought out mid-term due to a consolidation of financial institutions. Although we devote considerable effort toward the development of a competitively-priced, high-quality suite of products and services for the financial services industry, there can be no assurance that significant financial institution clients will be retained or that the impact of the loss of a significant client can be offset through the addition of new clients or by expanded sales to our remaining clients.The severity and length of the present downturn in the global economy is unknown. While the global economy did recover somewhat in 2010, there can be no assurance that there will not be a deterioration in financial markets and in general business conditions in 2011, which could negatively affect our operating results.We may not be successful at implementing our growth strategies.We continue to execute strategies intended to drive sustained revenue and earnings growth. We are continuing to invest in several key enablers to achieve our strategies, including strengthening our portfolio of products and services, attracting new customers, improving our use of technology, and enhancing brand awareness and positioning. Additionally, we expect to drive growth from business services, including web design, hosting and other web services, payroll, logo design, search engine marketing and business networking. The market for many of these services is relatively new and untested and small businesses may be slow to adopt these services. If the market for these business services fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, or if our services fail to achieve widespread customer acceptance, our operating results would be negatively affected.All of our growth initiatives have required and will continue to require investment. Business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, may impact the success of our growth strategies. We can provide no assurance that our growth strategies will be successful either in the short-term or in the long-term, or that they will generate a positive return on our investment.We face intense competition in all areas of our business.Although we are one of the leading check printers in the United States, we face considerable competition. In addition to competition from alternative payment methods, we also face intense competition from another large check printer in our traditional financial institution sales channel, from direct mail sellers of personal checks, from sellers of business checks and forms, from check printing software vendors and from internet-based sellers of our products and services to individuals and small businesses. Additionally, low price, high volume office supply chain stores offer standardized business forms, checks and related products to small businesses. Our business services offerings also face intense competition, and with relatively low barriers to entry in this industry, we expect the intensity of competition to increase in the future from other established and emerging companies.We can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. Continued competition could result in additional price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of customers and an increase in up-front cash payments to financial institutions upon contract execution or renewal, all of which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Small Business Services’ standardized business forms and related products face technological obsolescence and changing customer preferences.Continual technological improvements provide small business customers with alternative means to enact and record business transactions. For example, because of the lower price and higher performance capabilities of personal computers, printers and mobile devices, small businesses now have an alternate means to print many business forms. Additionally, electronic transaction systems, off-the-shelf business software applications and mobile applications have been designed to replace pre-printed business forms products. If small business preferences change rapidly and we are unable to develop new products and services with comparable profit margins, our results of operations could be adversely affected.   13Table of ContentsThe check printing portion of the payments industry is mature and, if check usage declines faster than expected, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Check printing is, and is expected to continue to be, an essential part of our business. We sell checks for personal and small business use and believe that there will continue to be a substantial demand for these checks for the foreseeable future. However, the total number of checks written in the United States has been in decline since the mid-1990’s. According to a Federal Reserve study released in December 2010, the total number of checks written by individuals and small businesses declined 6.1% each year between 2006 and 2009. We believe that the number of checks written will continue to decline due to the increasing use of alternative payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, automated teller machines, direct deposit, and electronic and other bill paying services. However, the rate and the extent to which alternative payment methods will achieve acceptance and replace checks, whether as a result of legislative developments, personal preference or otherwise, cannot be predicted with certainty. A surge in the popularity of any of these alternative payment methods, or our inability to successfully offset the decline in check usage with other sources of revenue, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects.The failure to reduce costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Intense competition compels us to continually improve our operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve profitability. Since the second quarter of 2006, we have reduced our cost structure approximately $325 million, net of required investments, primarily within sales, marketing and our shared services functions, including fulfillment, information technology, real estate, finance and human resources. We will continue to explore ways to simplify our business processes and reduce our cost and expense structure. We anticipate that we will realize additional cost reductions of approximately $65 million in 2011, as compared to our 2010 results of operations. Cost reduction initiatives have required and will continue to require up-front expenditures related to items such as redesigning and streamlining processes, consolidating information technology platforms, standardizing technology applications, improving real estate utilization and funding employee severance benefits. We can provide no assurance that we will achieve future cost reductions or that we will do so without incurring unexpected or greater than anticipated expenditures. Moreover, we may find that we are unable to achieve business simplification and/or cost reduction goals without disrupting our business and, as a result, may choose to delay or forego certain cost reductions as business conditions require. Failure to continue to improve our operating efficiency could adversely affect our prospects if we are unable to remain competitive.Continued weak economic conditions could result in additional asset impairment charges.Declines in our stock price, as well as the impact of the economic downturn on our expected operating results, led to asset impairment charges in 2009 related to goodwill and an indefinite-lived trade name in our Small Business Services segment. If our stock price declines in the future for a sustained period or if a continued downturn in economic conditions continues to negatively affect our actual and forecasted operating results, it may be indicative of a further decline in our fair value and may require us to record an impairment charge for a portion of goodwill and/or our indefinite-lived trade name. Such a charge could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position.Weak direct mail response rates could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Our Direct Checks segment and portions of our Small Business Services segment have, at times, experienced declines in response rates related to direct mail promotional materials. While we believe that media response rates have declined across a wide variety of products and services, we believe that the declines we have experienced are also attributable to the decline in check usage, the gradual obsolescence of standardized forms products and increasing utilization of e-commerce by both consumers and small businesses. In an attempt to offset these impacts, we continually modify our marketing and sales efforts and have shifted a greater portion of our advertising investment to the internet. Competitive pressure may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the prices of our products and new marketing strategies may not be successful. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to offset a decline in response rates, even with additional marketing and sales efforts. If we are unable to attract customers in a cost effective manner, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.We rely on a variety of methods to promote our products and services, such as direct mail advertising, purchased search results from online search engines, e-mail and telesales. The profitability of our Direct Checks segment depends in large part on our ability to secure adequate advertising media placements at acceptable rates. We can provide no assurance regarding the future cost, effectiveness and/or availability of suitable advertising media. In addition, future legislation could affect our ability to advertise via direct mail or e-mail. Congress has contemplated enacting “anti-spam” legislation in response to consumer complaints about unsolicited e-mail advertisements. If anti-spam legislation is enacted and/or if similar legislation is enacted for direct mail advertisers, we may be unable to sustain our current levels of profitability.   14Table of ContentsIn addition to print and e-mail advertising, many customers access our websites through internet search engines. Search engines typically provide two types of search results, algorithmic and purchased listings. Algorithmic listings are not purchased, but are determined and displayed solely by a set of formulas designed by the search engine. Purchased listings can be bought to attract users to our websites. We rely on both algorithmic and purchased listings to attract customers to our websites. Search engines revise their algorithms from time to time in an attempt to optimize their search results listings and to maximize the advertising revenue generated by those listings. If search engines on which we rely for algorithmic listings modify their algorithms, this could result in fewer customers going to our websites. Additionally, one or more of the search engines on which we rely for purchased listings could modify or terminate their relationship with us. As we analyze our overall advertising strategy, we may have to resort to more costly resources to replace lost internet traffic, which would adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the cost of purchased search engine listings could increase as demand for them continues to grow, and further cost increases could negatively affect our profitability.We may not succeed in promoting and strengthening our brand, which could prevent us from acquiring customers and increasing revenue.The success of Small Business Services depends, in part, on our ability to attract new and repeat customers. For this reason, a component of our business strategy is the promotion and strengthening of the Deluxe brand. We believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase relative to certain of our business service offerings due to the low barriers to entry in the internet channel. Customer awareness of our brand, as well as the perceived value of our brand, will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality customer experience. To promote our brand, we have incurred and will continue to incur expense related to advertising and other marketing efforts. We can provide no assurance that we will realize a positive return on this investment.A component of our brand promotion strategy is establishing a relationship of trust with our customers, which we believe can be achieved by providing a high quality customer experience. We have invested, and will continue to invest, resources in website development, technology and customer service operations. Our ability to provide a high quality customer experience is also dependent on external factors including the reliability and performance of our suppliers and telecommunications providers. If we are unable to provide a high quality customer experience for any reason, our reputation would be harmed and our efforts to develop brand loyalty would be adversely impacted. The failure of our brand promotion activities could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and maintain customer relationships, which would adversely harm our business and results of operations.We face uncertainty regarding the success of recent and future acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.During 2010, we acquired Custom Direct, Inc. and Cornerstone Customer Solutions, LLC, and during 2009, we acquired Abacus America, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aplus Holdings, Inc., as well as MerchEngines.com. During 2008, we acquired Hostopia.com Inc., PartnerUp, Inc., and Logo Design Mojo, Inc. We have invested in acquisitions that we believe offer higher-growth business services, extend our direct-to-consumer offerings, improve our operating cash flow, and bring analytics-driven deposit acquisition marketing programs to our financial institution clients. The integration of any acquisition involves numerous risks, including: difficulties in assimilating operations and products; failure to realize expected synergies; diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; potential loss of key employees; potential exposure to unknown liabilities; and possible loss of our clients and customers or the clients and customers of the acquired businesses. One or more of these factors could impact our ability to successfully integrate an acquisition and could negatively affect our results of operations.We may continue to invest in small to medium-sized acquisitions. We cannot predict whether suitable acquisition candidates can be acquired on acceptable terms or whether any acquired products, technologies or businesses will contribute to our revenue or earnings to any material extent. Significant acquisitions typically result in additional contingent liabilities or debt and/or additional amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, and thus, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The cost and availability of materials, delivery services and energy could adversely affect our operating results.We are subject to risks associated with the cost and availability of paper, plastics, ink, other raw materials, delivery services and energy. Postal rates have increased in recent years and fuel costs have fluctuated over the past several years. Additionally, there are relatively few paper suppliers. As such, when our suppliers increase paper prices, we may not be able to obtain better pricing from alternative suppliers. Competitive pressures and/or contractual arrangements may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the price of our products.Paper costs represent a significant portion of our materials cost. Historically, we have not been negatively impacted by paper shortages because of our relationships with paper suppliers. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to purchase sufficient quantities of paper if such a shortage were to occur. Additionally, we depend upon third party providers for   15Table of Contents  delivery services. Events resulting in the inability of these service providers to perform their obligations, such as extended labor strikes, could adversely impact our results of operations by requiring us to secure alternate providers at higher costs. Security breaches involving customer data, or the perception that e-commerce is not secure, could adversely affect our reputation and business.We rely on various security procedures and systems to ensure the secure storage and transmission of data. Computer networks and the internet are, by nature, vulnerable to unauthorized access. An accidental or willful security breach could result in unauthorized access and/or use of customer data, including consumers’ nonpublic personal information. Our security measures could be breached by a third-party action, employee error or malfeasance, or design flaws in our systems could be exposed and exploited. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If a third party obtains unauthorized access to any of our customers’ data, our reputation could be damaged, clients and consumers could be deterred from ordering our products and services, and client contracts could be terminated. We could also be exposed to time-consuming and expensive litigation. If we are unsuccessful in defending a lawsuit regarding security breaches, we may be forced to pay damages which would have an adverse affect on our operating results. In addition, some states have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity. If we were required to make such a disclosure, it may cause our clients and customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures. Likewise, general publicity regarding security breaches at other companies could lead to the perception among the general public that e-commerce is not secure. This could decrease traffic to our websites and limit future business opportunities.Interruptions to our website operations or information technology systems could damage our reputation and harm our business.The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our information technology systems is critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers. We could experience temporary interruptions in our websites, transaction processing systems, network infrastructure, printing production facilities or customer service operations for a variety of reasons, including human error, software errors, power loss, telecommunications failures, fire, flood, extreme weather and other events beyond our control. In addition, our technology, infrastructure and processes may contain undetected errors or design faults which may cause our websites or operating systems to fail. The failure of our systems could adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects.Declines in the equity markets could affect the value of our postretirement benefit plan assets, which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.The fair value of our postretirement benefit plan assets is subject to various risks, including credit, interest and overall market volatility risk. During 2008, the equity markets experienced a significant decline in value, resulting in a significant decrease in the fair value of our plan assets. This materially affected the funded status of the plan and resulted in higher postretirement benefit expense in 2009. The fair value of our plan assets did recover during 2009 and 2010. Although our obligation is limited to funding benefits as they become payable, future declines in the fair value of our plan assets would result in increased expense, as well as the need to contribute increased amounts of cash to fund benefits payable under the plan.We may be unable to maintain our licenses to use third party intellectual property on favorable terms, which would affect our ability to offer licensed products to our customers, and thus, adversely affect our operating results.Check designs licensed from third parties account for a portion of our revenue. These license agreements generally average three years in duration. There can be no guarantee that such licenses will be available to us indefinitely or under terms that would allow us to continue to sell the licensed products profitably, which would adversely impact our results of operations. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and other qualified employees, our business could suffer.Our success at efforts to grow our business depends on the contributions and abilities of key employees, especially in the areas of sales, marketing and product management. If we are unable to retain our existing employees and attract qualified personnel, we may not be able to manage our business effectively. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.We may be unable to protect our rights in intellectual property, which could harm our business and ability to compete.We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret and patent protection, and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks, software and other intellectual property. These protective measures afford only    16Table of Contents limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products and services which do not infringe on our intellectual property rights. We may be required to spend significant resources to protect our trade secrets and to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete. If third party providers of certain significant information technology needs are unable to provide services, our business could be disrupted and the cost of such services could increase.We have entered into agreements with third party providers for information technology services, including telecommunications and network server and transaction processing services. In the event that one or more of these providers is not able to provide adequate or timely information technology services, we could be adversely affected. Although we believe that information technology services are available from numerous sources, a failure to perform by one or more of our service providers could cause a disruption in our business while we obtain an alternative source of supply. In addition, the use of substitute third party providers could result in increased expense.Legislation relating to consumer privacy protection could limit or harm our business.We are subject to regulations implementing the privacy and information security requirements of the federal financial modernization law known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and other federal regulation and state law on the same subject. These laws and regulations require us to develop, implement and maintain policies and procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of consumers’ nonpublic personal information. We are also subject to additional requirements in certain of our contracts with financial institution clients, which are often more restrictive than the regulations. These regulations and agreements limit our ability to use or disclose nonpublic personal information for other than the purposes originally intended, which could limit business opportunities. The complexity of compliance with these regulations may also increase the cost of doing business.We are unable to predict whether more restrictive legislation or regulation will be adopted in the future. Any future legislation or regulation, or the interpretation of existing legislation or regulation, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and prospects. Laws and regulations relating to consumer privacy may be adopted in the future with respect to the internet, e-commerce or marketing practices. Such laws or regulations may impede the growth of the internet and/or the use of other sales or marketing vehicles. For example, new privacy laws could decrease traffic to our websites, decrease telemarketing opportunities and increase the cost of obtaining new customers.A third party could assert that we are infringing its intellectual property, which could result in costly litigation or require us to obtain licenses.The e-commerce channel is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights, and by increasing litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Third parties may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us. These claims, whether successful or not, could divert management’s attention, result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, or require us to redesign our software or services to avoid infringement. If we fail to obtain a required license and are unable to design around a third party’s patent, we may be unable to effectively conduct certain business activities. Consequently, third party intellectual property claims could result in increased expense or could limit our ability to generate revenue.We may be subject to sales and other taxes which could have an adverse effect on our business.In accordance with existing state and local tax laws, we currently collect sales, use or other similar taxes in state and local jurisdictions where we have a physical presence. One or more state or local jurisdiction may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state companies which engage in remote or online commerce. Further, tax law and the interpretation of constitutional limitations thereon is subject to change. In addition, any new operations in states where we do not currently have a physical presence could subject shipments of goods by our direct-to-consumer businesses into such states to sales tax under current or future laws. If one or more state or local jurisdiction successfully asserts that we should have collected sales or other taxes in the past but did not, or that we must collect sales or other taxes in the future beyond our current practices, either determination could have an adverse affect on our business. We are subject to environmental risks which, if realized, could have an adverse impact on our operating results.Our printing facilities are subject to many federal and state regulations designed to protect the environment. We have sold former printing facilities to third parties and, in some instances, have agreed to indemnify the buyer of the facility for certain environmental liabilities. Unforeseen conditions at current or former facilities could result in additional liability and expense beyond our insurance coverage.   17Table of Contents "
6,DLX,DELUXE CORP,2010-02-19,">Item 1A.     Risk Factors
.     Our business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could beadversely affected by various risks and uncertainties. These risks include, but are not limited to,the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form10-K. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, mayalso adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Youshould carefully consider all of these risks and uncertainties before investing in our commonstock.     The following important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from thestatements we make from time to time regarding our future results, including, but not limited to,forecasts regarding estimated revenue, earnings per share or cash provided by operating activities.Any forecast regarding our future performance reflects various assumptions which are subject tosignificant uncertainties and, as a matter of course, may prove to be incorrect. Further, theachievement of any forecast depends on numerous factors which are beyond our control. Consequently,no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and the variation from such statements may bematerial and adverse. You are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business andprospects upon isolated statements, and are encouraged to use the entire mix of historical andforward-looking information made available by us, and other information affecting us and ourproducts and services, including the following factors.     Weak economic conditions and turmoil in the financial services industry could continue to havean adverse effect on our operating results.     Beginning in 2008, global financial markets experienced disruption, including, among otherissues, volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability,ratings downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of other investments.Governments took unprecedented actions intended to address the extreme market conditions. Theseeconomic developments adversely affected businesses like ours in a number of ways during 2009. Therate of small business formations, small business confidence, consumer spending and employmentlevels all have an impact on our businesses. Below average small business optimism and a decline insmall business formations negatively impacted our results of operations in Small Business Servicesin 2009. Small businesses typically have more limited budgets and are more likely to besignificantly affected by economic downturns than larger, more established companies. Duringeconomic downturns, small businesses may choose to spend their limited funds on items other thanour products and services. Consumer spending and employment levels also trended negatively during2009, resulting in some negative impact in our personal check businesses. We cannot predict whetherthese negative economic trends will improve or worsen in the near future. A continued downturn ingeneral economic conditions could result in additional declines in our revenue and profitability.In addition, our committed line of credit is scheduled to expire in July 2010. As we negotiate areplacement line of credit, the current unfavorable credit environment and our current creditprofile will result in higher interest rates and/or terms which are not as favorable to us as ourexisting line of credit agreement.     As a result of global economic conditions, a number of financial institutions soughtadditional capital, merged with other financial institutions and, in some cases, failed. Thisturmoil in the financial services industry affected and may continue to affect our results ofoperations in a number of ways. Our experience indicates that financial institution failures andconsolidation of companies within the financial services industry have caused some larger financialinstitutions to lose customers. This reduces our order volume when those customers move theiraccounts to financial institutions that are not our clients or they reduce or13Table of Contentsdelay their check purchases. The failure of one or more of our larger financial institutionclients, or large portions of our customer base, could adversely affect our operating results. Inaddition to the possibility of losing a significant client, the inability to recover contractacquisition costs paid to one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or the inabilityto collect accounts receivable or contractually required contract termination payments from thesefinancial institution clients, could have a significant negative impact on our results ofoperations. Also, there may be an increase in financial institution mergers and acquisitions duringthis period of economic uncertainty. Such an increase could adversely affect our operating results.Often the newly combined entity seeks to reduce costs by leveraging economies of scale inpurchasing, including its check supply contracts. This results in check providers competingintensely on price in order to retain not only their previous business with one of the financialinstitutions, but also to gain the business of the other party in the merger/acquisition. Financialinstitution mergers and acquisitions can also impact the duration of our contracts. Normally, thelength of our contracts with financial institutions ranges from four to six years. However,contracts may be renegotiated or bought out mid-term due to a consolidation of financialinstitutions. Although we devote considerable effort toward the development of acompetitively-priced, high-quality suite of products and services for the financial servicesindustry, there can be no assurance that significant financial institution clients will be retainedor that the impact of the loss of a significant client can be offset through the addition of newclients or by expanded sales to our remaining clients.     The severity and length of the present disruptions in the financial markets and the financialservices industry, as well as the length of the recession in the global economy, are unknown. Therecan be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and ingeneral business conditions, which could continue to negatively affect our operating results.     We may not be successful at implementing our growth strategies within Small Business Services.     We continue to execute strategies intended to drive sustained revenue and earnings growthwithin Small Business Services. We are continuing to invest in several key enablers to achieve ourstrategies, including continuing to improve our e-commerce capabilities, implementing an integratedplatform for our various brands, improving our customer analytics, focusing on key customersegments and improving our merchandising. We expect to drive growth as we gain new customers, growour distributor channel and obtain a greater portion of our revenue from business services,including web design, hosting and other web services, payroll, logo design, search engine marketingand business networking. All of these initiatives have required and will continue to requireinvestment. Business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which arebeyond our control, may impact the success of our growth strategies. We can provide no assurancethat our growth strategies will be successful either in the short-term or the long-term and resultin a positive return on our investment.     We face intense competition in all areas of our business.     Although we are one of the leading check printers in the United States, we face considerablecompetition. In addition to competition from alternative payment methods, we also face intensecompetition from another check printer in our traditional financial institution sales channel, fromdirect mail sellers of personal checks, from sellers of business checks and forms, from checkprinting software vendors and from internet-based sellers of checks to individuals and smallbusinesses. Additionally, low price, high volume office supply chain stores offer standardizedbusiness forms, checks and related products to small businesses. Our business services offeringsalso face intense competition. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to competeeffectively against current and future competitors. Continued competition could result inadditional price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of customers and an increase in up-frontcash payments to financial institutions upon contract execution or renewal, all of which would havea material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.     Small Business Services standardized business forms and related products face technologicalobsolescence and changing customer preferences.     Continual technological improvements provide small business customers with alternative meansto enact and record business transactions. For example, because of the lower price and higherperformance capabilities of personal computers and related printers, small businesses now have analternate means to print many business forms. Additionally, electronic transaction systems andoff-the-shelf business software applications have been designed to replace pre-printed businessforms products. If small business preferences change rapidly and we are unable to develop newproducts and services with comparable profit margins, our results of operations could be adverselyaffected.14Table of Contents     The check printing portion of the payments industry is mature and, if check usage declinesfaster than expected, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.     Check printing is, and is expected to continue to be, an essential part of our business. Wesell checks for personal and small business use and believe that there will continue to be asubstantial demand for these checks for the foreseeable future. However, the total number of checkswritten in the United States has been in decline since the mid-1990s. According to our estimates,the total number of checks written by individuals and small businesses has been decliningapproximately four to six percent each year. The declines were greater in 2009 and 2008, webelieve, due to the economic recession and instability in the financial services industry. Webelieve that the number of checks written will continue to decline due to the increasing use ofalternative payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, automated teller machines, directdeposit, and electronic and other bill paying services. However, the rate and the extent to whichalternative payment methods will achieve acceptance and replace checks, whether as a result oflegislative developments, personal preference or otherwise, cannot be predicted with certainty. Asurge in the popularity of any of these alternative payment methods, or our inability tosuccessfully offset the decline in check usage with other sources of revenue, could have a materialadverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects.     The failure to reduce costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results.     Intense competition compels us to continually improve our operating efficiency in order tomaintain or improve profitability. We intend to continue to reduce expenses, primarily withinsales, marketing and our shared services functions, including fulfillment, information technology,real estate, finance and human resources. We also expect to continue to simplify our businessprocesses and reduce our cost and expense structure.

Failure to meet our planned cost reduction targets would adversely affect ourresults of operations and could adversely affect our prospects if we are unable to remaincompetitive.     Continued weak economic conditions could result in additional asset impairment charges.     Declines in our stock price, as well as the impact of the economic downturn on our expectedoperating results, led to asset impairment charges in 2009 related to goodwill and anindefinite-lived trade name in our Small Business Services segment. If our stock price declines inthe future for a sustained period or if a continued downturn in economic conditions continues tonegatively affect our actual and forecasted operating results, it may be indicative of a furtherdecline in our fair value and may require us to record an impairment charge for a portion ofgoodwill and/or our indefinite-lived trade name. The credit agreement governing our committed lineof credit requires us to maintain a ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest expenseof 3.0 times, as measured quarterly on an aggregate basis for the preceding four quarters.Significant impairment charges in the future could impact our ability to comply with this debtcovenant, in which case, our lenders could demand immediate repayment of amounts outstanding underour line of credit. Although we remained in compliance with this debt covenant throughout 2009,despite asset impairment charges of $24.9 million, we cannot provide definitive assurance regardingour continued compliance with this debt covenant. Our committed line of credit expires in July 2010. We expect that we will replace this line of credit well in advance of its expiration date. Anynew line of credit agreement will likely contain  revised debtcovenants.     Continued softness in direct mail response rates could have an adverse impact on our operatingresults.     Our Direct Checks segment and portions of our Small Business Services segment have, at times,experienced declines in response rates related to direct mail promotional materials. While webelieve that media response rates have declined across a wide variety of products and services, webelieve that declines we have experienced in the past are also attributable to the declinein check usage, the gradual obsolescence of standardized forms products and increasing utilizationof e-commerce by both consumers and small businesses. In an attempt to offset these impacts, wecontinually modify our marketing and sales efforts and have recently shifted a greater portion ofour advertising investment to the internet. Competitive pressure may inhibit our ability to reflectincreased costs in the prices of our products and new marketing strategies may not be15Table of Contentssuccessful. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to offset the decline in responserates, even with additional marketing and sales efforts.     The inability to secure adequate advertising placements could have an adverse impact on ouroperating results.     The profitability of our Direct Checks segment depends in large part on our ability to secureadequate advertising media placements at acceptable rates. We can provide no assurance regardingthe future cost, effectiveness and/or availability of suitable advertising media. In addition,future legislation could affect our ability to advertise via direct mail or e-mail. Congressenacted a federal Do Not Call registry in response to consumer backlash against telemarketers andis contemplating enacting anti-spam legislation in response to consumer complaints aboutunsolicited e-mail advertisements. If anti-spam legislation is enacted and/or if similarlegislation is enacted for direct mail advertisers, we may be unable to sustain our current levelsof profitability.     In addition to print advertising, many customers access our websites through internet searchengines. Search engines typically provide two types of search results, algorithmic and purchasedlistings. Algorithmic listings cannot be purchased, but are determined and displayed solely by aset of formulas designed by the search engine. Purchased listings can be bought to attract users toour websites. We rely on both algorithmic and purchased listings to attract customers to ourwebsites. Search engines revise their algorithms from time to time in an attempt to optimize theirsearch results. If search engines on which we rely for algorithmic listings modify theiralgorithms, this could result in fewer customers going to our websites. Additionally, one or moresearch engine on which we rely for purchased listings could modify their policies in a manner whichnegatively impacts the effectiveness of our internet advertising. As we analyze our overalladvertising strategy, we may have to resort to more costly resources to replace lost internettraffic, which would adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the cost of purchasedsearch engine listings could increase as demand for them continues togrow, and further costincreases could negatively affect our profitability.     We face uncertainty regarding the success of recent and future acquisitions, which could havean adverse impact on our operating results.     During 2009, we acquired Abacus America, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aplus Holdings,Inc., as well as MerchEngines.com. During 2008, we acquired Hostopia.com Inc., PartnerUp, Inc., andLogo Design Mojo, Inc. These acquisitions were completed with the intention of increasing sales ofhigher growth business services. The integration of any acquisition involves numerous risks,including: difficulties in assimilating operations and products; failure to realize expectedsynergies; diversion of managements attention from other business concerns; potential loss of keyemployees; potential exposure to unknown liabilities; and possible loss of our clients andcustomers or the clients and customers of the acquired businesses. One or more of these factorscould impact our ability to successfully integrate an acquisition and could negatively affect ourresults of operations.     In regard to future acquisitions, we cannot predict whether suitable acquisition candidatescan be acquired on acceptable terms or whether any acquired products, technologies or businesseswill contribute to our revenue or earnings to any material extent. Significant acquisitionstypically result in additional contingent liabilities or debt and/or additional amortizationexpense related to acquired intangible assets, and thus, could adversely affect our business,results of operations and financial condition.     The cost and availability of materials, delivery services and energy could adversely affectour operating results.     We are subject to risks associated with the cost and availability of paper, plastics, ink,other raw materials, delivery services and energy. Postal ratesincreased in each of the last three yearsand fuel costs have fluctuated over the past several years. Additionally, there are relatively fewpaper suppliers. As such, when our suppliers increase paper prices, as they did in 2009, we may notbe able to obtain better pricing from alternative suppliers. Competitive pressures and/orcontractual arrangements may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the price of ourproducts.     Paper costs represent a significant portion of our materials cost. Historically, we have notbeen negatively impacted by paper shortages because of our relationships with paper suppliers.However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to purchase sufficient quantities ofpaper if such a shortage were to occur. Additionally, we depend upon third party providers fordelivery services. Events resulting in the inability of these service providers to perform theirobligations, such as extended labor strikes, could adversely impact our results of operations byrequiring us to secure alternate providers at higher costs.16Table of Contents     Security breaches involving customer data, or the perception that e-commerce is not secure,could adversely affect our reputation and business.     We rely on various security procedures and systems to ensure the secure storage andtransmission of data. Computer networks and the internet are, by nature, vulnerable to unauthorizedaccess. An accidental or willful security breach could result in unauthorized access and/or use ofcustomer data, including consumers nonpublic personal information. Our security measures could bebreached by a third-party action, employee error or malfeasance, or design flaws in our systemscould be exposed and exploited. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or tosabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched againsta target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventativemeasures. If a third party obtains unauthorized access to any of our customers data, ourreputation could be damaged, clients and consumers could be deterred from ordering our products andservices, and client contracts could be terminated. We could also be exposed to time-consuming andexpensive litigation. If we are unsuccessful in defending a lawsuit regarding security breaches, wemay be forced to pay damages which could have an adverse affect on our operating results. Inaddition, some states have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data securitybreaches involving their personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breachoften lead to widespread negative publicity. If we were required to make such a disclosure, it maycause our clients and customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data securitymeasures. Likewise, general publicity regarding security breaches at other companies could lead tothe perception among the general public that e-commerce is not secure. This could decrease trafficto our websites and foreclose future business opportunities.     Interruptions to our website operations or information technology systems could damage ourreputation and harm our business.     The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our information technologysystems is critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers. We couldexperience temporary interruptions in our websites, transaction processing systems, networkinfrastructure, printing production facilities or customer service operations for a variety ofreasons, including human error, software errors, power loss, telecommunications failures, fire,flood, extreme weather and other events beyond our control. In addition, our technology,infrastructure and processes may contain undetected errors or design faults which may cause ourwebsites or operating systems to fail. The failure of our systems could adversely affect ourbusiness, results of operations and prospects.     Declines in the equity markets could affect the value of our postretirement benefit planassets, which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.     Thefair value of the assets of our postretirement benefit plan is subject to various risks, including credit, interest andoverall market volatility risks. During 2008, the equity marketsexperienced a significant decline invalue, resulting in a significant decrease in the fair value of our plan assets. This materiallyaffected the funded status of the plan and resulted in higher postretirement benefit expense in2009. Although our obligation is limited to funding benefits as they become payable, declines inthe fair value of these assets would result in further expense increases, as well as the need tocontribute increased amounts of cash to fund benefits payable under the plan.     We may be unable to maintain our licenses to use third party intellectual property onfavorable terms, which would affect our ability to offer licensed products to our customers, andthus, adversely affect our operating results.     Check designs licensed from third parties account for a portion of our revenue. These licenseagreements generally average three years in duration. There can be no guarantee that such licenseswill be available to us indefinitely or under terms that would allow us to continue to sell thelicensed products profitably, which would adversely impact our results of operations.     If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and other qualified employees, ourbusiness could suffer.     Our success at efforts to grow our business depends on the contributions and abilities of keyemployees, especially in the areas of sales, marketing and product management. If we are unable toretain our existing employees and attract qualified personnel, we may not be able to manage ourbusiness effectively. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in attracting andretaining such personnel.17Table of Contents     We may be unable to protect our rights in intellectual property, which could harm our businessand ability to compete.     We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret and patent protection,and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks, software and otherintellectual property. These measures afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts toprotect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectualproperty or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products and services which donot infringe on our intellectual property rights. We may be required to spend significant resourcesto protect our trade secrets and to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. The lossof intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual propertyprotection could harm our business and ability to compete.     If third party providers of certain significant information technology needs are unable toprovide services, our business could be disrupted and the cost of such services could increase.     We have entered into agreements with third party providers for information technologyservices, including telecommunications and network server and transaction processing services. Inthe event that one or more of these providers is not able to provide adequate or timely informationtechnology services, we could be adversely affected. Although we believe that informationtechnology services are available from numerous sources, a failure to perform by one or more of ourservice providers could cause a disruption in our business while we obtain an alternative source ofsupply. In addition, the use of substitute third party providers could result in increased expense.     Legislation relating to consumer privacy protection could limit or harm our business.     We are subject to regulations implementing the privacy and information security requirementsof the federal financial modernization law known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and other federalregulation and state law on the same subject. These laws and regulations require us to develop,implement and maintain policies and procedures to protect the security and confidentiality ofconsumers nonpublic personal information. We are also subject to additional requirements incertain of our contracts with financial institution clients, which are often more restrictive thanthe regulations. These regulations and agreements limit our ability to use or disclose nonpublicpersonal information for other than the purposes originally intended, which could limit businessopportunities. The complexity of compliance with these regulations may also increase the cost ofdoing business.     We are unable to predict whether more restrictive legislation or regulation will be adopted inthe future. Any future legislation or regulation, or the interpretation of existing legislation orregulation, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and prospects. Lawsand regulations relating to consumer privacy may be adopted in the future with respect to theinternet, e-commerce or marketing practices. Such laws or regulations may impede the growth of theinternet and/or the use of other sales or marketing vehicles. For example, new privacy laws coulddecrease traffic to our websites, decrease telemarketing opportunities and increase the cost ofobtaining new customers.     A third party could assert that we are infringing its intellectual property, which couldresult in costly litigation or require us to obtain licenses.     The e-commerce industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents,trademarks and copyrights, and by increasing litigation based on allegations of infringement orother violations of intellectual property rights. Third parties may assert patent and otherintellectual property infringement claims against us. These claims, whether successful or not,could divert managements attention, result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us toenter into royalty or licensing agreements, or require us to redesign our software or services toavoid infringement. If we fail to obtain a required license and are unable to design around a thirdpartys patent, we may be unable to effectively conduct certain business activities. Consequently,third party intellectual property claims could result in increased expense or could limit ourability to generate revenue.     We may be subject to sales and other taxes which could have an adverse effect on our business.     In accordance with existing state and local tax laws, we currently collect sales, use or othersimilar taxes in state and local jurisdictions where we have a physical presence. One or more stateor local jurisdiction may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state companieswhich engage in remote or online commerce. Further, tax law and the interpretation ofconstitutional limitations thereon is subject to change. In addition, any new operations in stateswhere we do not currently have a physical presence could subject shipments of goods by ourdirect-to-consumer businesses into such states to sales tax under18Table of Contentscurrent or future laws. If one or more state or local jurisdiction successfully asserts thatwe should have collected sales or other taxes in the past but did not, or that we must collectsales or other taxes in the future beyond our current practices, either determination could have amaterial, adverse affect on our business.     We are subject to environmental risks which, if realized, could have an adverse impact on ouroperating results.     Our printing facilities are subject to many federal and state regulations designed to protectthe environment. We have sold former printing facilities to third parties, and in some instances,have agreed to indemnify the buyer of the facility for certain environmental liabilities.Unforeseen conditions at current or former facilities could result in additional liability andexpense beyond our insurance coverage"
13,DLX,DELUXE CORP,2009-02-20,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.     Our business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could beadversely affected by various risks and uncertainties. These risks include, but are not limited to,the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form10-K. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may alsoimpair our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. You shouldcarefully consider all of these risks before making an investment in our common stock.12      Weak economic conditions within the United States and globally could continue to have anadverse effect on our operating results and could result in additional impairment charges.     For most of 2008, financial markets globally have experienced disruption, including, amongother things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and creditavailability, ratings downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others.Governments have taken unprecedented actions intended to address extreme market conditions that,among other concerns, include severely restricted credit. Largely as a result of these disruptionsin financial markets, most analysts believe the global economy has entered a potentially prolongedrecession. These economic developments may adversely affect businesses like ours in a number ofways, such as:  The rate of small business formations, small business confidence, consumer spending andemployment levels, as well as energy costs, all have an impact on our businesses. Belowaverage small business optimism and a decline in small business formations negativelyimpacted our results of operations in Small Business Services in 2008, and we expect thistrend to continue, and possibly worsen, through 2009. Consumer spending and employment levelsalso trended negatively during 2008, resulting in some negative impact in our personal checkbusinesses. A prolonged downturn in general economic conditions could result in additionaldeclines in our revenue and profitability.   The failure of one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or large portionsof our customer base, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to thepossibility of losing a significant contract, the inability to recover contract acquisitioncosts paid to one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or the inability tocollect accounts receivable or contractually required contract termination payments fromthese financial institution clients, could have a significant negative impact on ourconsolidated results of operations.   There may be an increase in financial institution mergers and acquisitions during thisperiod of economic uncertainty. Such an increase could adversely affect our operatingresults. Often the newly combined entity seeks to reduce costs by leveraging economies ofscale in purchasing, including its check supply contracts. This results in check providerscompeting intensely on price in order to retain not only their previous business with one ofthe financial institutions, but also to gain the business of the other party in themerger/acquisition. Financial institution mergers and acquisitions can also impact theduration of our contracts. Normally, the length of our contracts with financial institutionsranges from three to five years. However, contracts are sometimes renegotiated or bought outmid-term due to a consolidation of financial institutions.   The effects of the recent economic downturn on our expected operating results and the broader U.S.market resulted in a significant reduction in our share price and led to asset impairmentcharges in 2008 related to trade names in our Small Business Services segment. Both beforeand after December 31, 2008, our common stock traded at prices lower than the December 31,2008 closing stock price of $14.96. If such a decline in our stockprice occurs in the future for a sustained period, it may be indicative of a furtherdecline in our fair value and would likely require us to record animpairment charge for a portion of the $40.2 million of goodwillallocated to one of our reporting units. Accordingly, we believe that a non-cash goodwill impairment chargerelated to this reporting unit and/or further impairment charges related to ourindefinite-lived trade name are reasonably possible in the future. This reporting unit had a calculated fair value which exceeded itscarrying value by $2.7 million as of December 31, 2008 and ourindefinite-lived trade name had a carrying value of $24.0 million as of December 31, 2008.The credit agreement governing our committed line of credit requires us to maintain a ratioof earnings before interest and taxes to interest expense of 3.0 times, as measured quarterlyon an aggregate basis for the preceding four quarters. Significant impairment charges in thefuture could impact our ability to comply with this debt covenant, in which case, our lenderscould demand immediate repayment of amounts outstanding under our line of credit. Although wewould have remained in compliance with this debt covenant even if our reported pre-taxearnings for 2008 had been $52 million lower than we reported, we cannot provide definitiveassurance regarding our continued compliance with this debt covenant.     The severity and length of the present disruptions in the financial markets and recession inthe global economy are unknown. There can be no assurance that there will not be a furtherdeterioration in financial markets and in general business conditions.     Our ability to reduce costs is critical to our success.     The intense competition we face compels us to continually improve our operating efficiency inorder to maintain or improve profitability. We intend to continue to reduce expenses, primarilywithin our shared services functions of fulfillment, information technology, real estate, finance, human resources and legal.We also expect to continue to simplify our business processesand reduce our cost and expense structure. These initiatives have required and will13 continue torequire up-front expenditures related to items such as redesigning and streamlining processes,consolidating information technology platforms, standardizing technology applications and improvingreal estate utilization. We can provide no assurance that we will achieve our anticipated costreductions or that we will do so without incurring unexpected or greater than anticipatedexpenditures. Moreover, we may find that we are unable to achieve our business simplification andcost reduction goals without disruption to our business and, as a result, may choose to delay orforego certain cost reductions as business conditions require. Failure to meet our planned costreduction targets would adversely affect our results of operations and could adversely affect ourprospects if we are unable to remain competitive.     We may not be successful at implementing our growth strategies within Small Business Services.     We continue to execute strategies intended to drive sustained growth within Small BusinessServices. We are continuing to invest in several key enablers toachieve our strategies, including continuing to improve oure-commerce capabilities, implementing an integrated platform for ourvarious brands, improving our customer analytics, focusing on keycustomer segments and improving our merchandising. Weexpect to drive growth as we obtain a greater portion of our revenue from higher growthannuity-based business services, including web hosting and other web services, business networkingand payroll. All of these initiatives have required and will continue to require investment. SmallBusiness Services revenue decreased in 2008, as compared to 2007, as the impact of economicconditions more than offset any favorability resulting from our growth strategies. We can provideno assurance that our growth strategies will be successful in the long-term and result in apositive return on our investment. Also, negative impacts resulting from the other risk factorsdescribed herein may offset or more than offset the benefit realized from our growth strategies.     We face intense competition in all areas of our business.     Although we are one of the leading check printers in the United States, we face considerablecompetition. In addition to competition from alternative payment methods, we also face intensecompetition from another check printer in our traditional financial institution sales channel, fromdirect mail sellers of personal checks, from sellers of business checks and forms, from checkprinting software vendors and from internet-based sellers of checks to individuals and smallbusinesses. Additionally, low price, high volume office supply chain stores offer standardizedbusiness forms, checks and related products to small businesses. We also face intense competitionwith our business services offerings. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to competeeffectively against current and future competitors. Continued competition could result inadditional price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of customers and an increase in up-frontcash payments to financial institutions upon contract execution or renewal, which would have amaterial adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.     Small Business Services standardized business forms and related products face technologicalobsolescence and changing customer preferences.     Continual technological improvements have provided small business customers with alternativemeans to enact and record business transactions. For example, because of the lower price and higherperformance capabilities of personal computers and related printers, small businesses now have analternate means to print many business forms. Additionally, electronic transaction systems andoff-the-shelf business software applications have been designed to replace pre-printed businessforms products. If small business preferences change rapidly and we are unable to develop newproducts and services with comparable profit margins, our results of operations could be adverselyaffected.     The check printing portion of the payments industry is mature and, if check usage declinesfaster than expected, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.     Check printing is, and is expected to continue to be, an essential part of our business,representing 65.4% of our consolidated revenue in 2008. We sell checks for personal and smallbusiness use and believe that there will continue to be a substantial demand for these checks forthe foreseeable future. However, the total number of checks written in the United States has beenin decline since the mid-1990s. According to our estimates, the total number of checks written byindividuals and small businesses is declining approximately four to six percent each year, althoughthe declines were greater in 2008, we believe, due to the economic recession and instability in the financialservices industry. We believe that the number of checks written will continue to decline due to theincreasing use of alternative payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, automatedteller machines, direct deposit and electronic and other bill paying services. However, the rateand the extent to which alternative payment methods will achieve acceptance and replace checks,whether as a result of legislative developments, personal preference or otherwise, cannot bepredicted with certainty. A surge in the popularity of any of these alternative payment14 methods, orour inability to successfully offset the decline in check usage with other sources of revenue,could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects.     Consolidation among financial institutions has, and may continue to, adversely affect thepricing of our products and may result in the loss of clients.     The number of financial institutions has declined due to consolidation in the financialservices industry. Margin pressures arise from such consolidation as merged entities seek to reducecosts by leveraging economies of scale, including their check supply contracts. The increase ingeneral negotiating leverage possessed by such consolidated entities has resulted in contractswhich are not as favorable to us as those historically negotiated with these clients, and in somecases, has resulted in the loss of clients to competitors. Although we devote considerable efforttoward the development of a competitively-priced, high-quality suite of products and services forthe financial services industry, there can be no assurance that significant financial institutionclients will be retained or that the loss of a significant client can be offset through theaddition of new clients or by expanded sales to our remaining clients.     Continuing softness in direct mail response rates could have a further adverse impact on ouroperating results.     Our Direct Checks segment and portions of our Small Business Services segment have experienceddeclines in response rates related to direct mail promotional materials. We believe that mediaresponse rates are declining across a wide variety of products and services. Additionally, webelieve that our declines are attributable to the general decline in check usage and the gradualobsolescence of standardized forms products. In an attempt to offset these impacts, we continue tomodify our marketing and sales efforts and have recently shifted a greater portion of ouradvertising investment to the internet. Competitive pressure may inhibit our ability to reflectincreased costs in the prices of our products and new marketing strategies may not be successful.We can provide no assurance that we will be able to offset the decline in response rates, even withadditional marketing and sales efforts.     The inability to secure adequate advertising placements could have an adverse impact on ouroperating results.     The profitability of our Direct Checks segment depends in large part on our ability to secureadequate advertising media placements at acceptable rates. We can provide no assurance regardingthe future cost, effectiveness and/or availability of suitable advertising media. In addition,future legislation could affect our ability to advertise via direct mail. Congress enacted afederal Do Not Call registry in response to consumer backlash against telemarketers and iscontemplating enacting anti-spam legislation in response to consumer complaints about unsolicitede-mail advertisements. If anti-spam legislation is enacted and/or if similar legislation is enactedfor direct mail advertisers, we may be unable to sustain our current levels of profitability. Inaddition, many Direct Checks customers access our websites through internet search engines. During2008, our results of operations were adversely affected by a dominant search engines decision tolimit our internet advertising based upon its revised advertising policies. As we analyze ouroverall advertising strategy, we may have to resort to more costly resources to replace thisinternet traffic, which would adversely affect our results of operations.     We face uncertainty with respect to recent and future acquisitions.     During 2008, we acquired Hostopia.com Inc., PartnerUp, Inc., and Logo Design Mojo, Inc. withthe intention of increasing sales of higher-growth annuity-based business services. The integrationof any acquisition involves numerous risks, including: difficulties in assimilating operations andproducts; diversion of managements attention from other business concerns; potential loss of keyemployees; potential exposure to unknown liabilities; and possible loss of our clients andcustomers or the clients and customers of the acquired businesses. One or more of these factorscould impact our ability to successfully integrate an acquisition and could negatively affect ourresults of operations.     In regard to future acquisitions, we cannot predict whether suitable acquisition candidatescan be acquired on acceptable terms or whether any acquired products, technologies or businesseswill contribute to our revenue or earnings to any material extent. Significant acquisitionstypically result in additional contingent liabilities or debt and/or additional amortizationexpense related to acquired intangible assets, and thus, could adversely affect our business,results of operations and financial condition.15      Declines in the equity markets could affect the value of our postretirement benefit andpension plan assets, which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.     The assets of our postretirement benefit and pension plans are valued at fair value usingquoted market prices. Investments, in general, are subject to various risks, including credit,interest and overall market volatility risks. During 2008, the equity markets saw a significantdecline in value. As such, the fair values of our plan assets decreased significantly from December31, 2007. This materially affected the funded status of the plans and will result in higherpostretirement benefit expense in 2009. Although our obligation is limited to funding benefits asthey become payable, continued declines in the fair value of these assets would result in furtherexpense increases, as well as the need to contribute increased amounts of cash to fund benefitspayable under the plans.     The cost and availability of materials, delivery services and energy could adversely affectour operating results.     We are subject to risks associated with the cost and availability of paper, plastics, ink,other raw materials, delivery services and energy. Postal rates increased in 2007 and 2008 and fuelcosts have fluctuated over the past several years. Additionally, there are relatively few papersuppliers. As such, when our suppliers increase paper prices, as they have indicated will be thecase in 2009, we may not be able to obtain better pricing from alternative suppliers. Competitivepressures and/or contractual arrangements may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in theprice of our products.     Paper costs represent a significant portion of our materials cost. Historically, we have notbeen negatively impacted by paper shortages because of our relationships with various papersuppliers. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to purchase sufficientquantities of paper if such a shortage were to occur. Additionally, we depend upon third partyproviders for delivery services. Events resulting in the inability of these service providers toperform their obligations, such as extended labor strikes, could adversely impact our results ofoperations by requiring us to secure alternate providers at higher costs.     Forecasts involving future results reflect various assumptions that may prove to be incorrect.     From time to time, we make predictions or forecasts regarding our future results, including,but not limited to, forecasts regarding estimated revenue, earnings per share or cash provided byoperating activities. Any forecast regarding our future performance reflects various assumptionswhich are subject to significant uncertainties and, as a matter of course, may prove to beincorrect. Further, the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous factors which are beyondour control. As a result, we cannot assure you that our performance will be consistent with anymanagement forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse.You are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolatedpredictions, and are encouraged to use the entire mix of historical and forward-looking informationmade available by us, and other information affecting us and our products and services, includingthe factors discussed here.     In addition, independent analysts periodically publish reports regarding our projected futureperformance. The methodologies we employ in arriving at our own internal projections and theapproaches taken by independent analysts in making their estimates are likely different in manysignificant respects. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to advise analysts or the publicmarkets of our views regarding the accuracy of the published estimates of independent analysts. Ifyou are relying on these estimates, you should pursue your own investigation and analysis of theiraccuracy and the reasonableness of the assumptions on which they are based.     Security breaches involving customer data, or the perception that e-commerce is not secure,could adversely affect our reputation and business.     We rely on various security procedures and systems to ensure the secure storage andtransmission of data. Computer networks and the internet are, by nature, vulnerable to unauthorizedaccess. We cannot provide assurance that misuse of new technologies or advances in criminalcapabilities will not compromise or breach our security procedures and systems resulting inunauthorized access and/or use of customer data, including consumers nonpublic personalinformation. A security breach could damage our reputation, deter clients and consumers fromordering our products and services, lead to the termination of client contracts and result inclaims against us. If we are unsuccessful in defending a lawsuit regardingsecurity breaches, we may be forced to pay damages which could have an adverse effect on ouroperating results. Additionally, general publicity regarding security breaches at other companiescould lead to the perception among the general public that e-commerce is not secure. This coulddecrease traffic to our websites and foreclose future business opportunities.16      We may be unable to maintain our licenses to use third party intellectual property onfavorable terms.     Check designs exclusively licensed from third parties account for a portion of our revenue.These license agreements generally average three years in duration. There can be no guarantee thatsuch licenses will be available to us indefinitely or under terms that would allow us to continueto sell the licensed products profitably, which would adversely impact our results of operations.     Interruptions to our website operations or information technology systems could damage ourreputation and harm our business.     The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our information technologysystems are critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers. We couldexperience temporary interruptions in our websites, transaction processing systems, networkinfrastructure, printing production facilities or customer service operations for a variety ofreasons, including human error, software errors, power loss, telecommunications failures, fire,flood, extreme weather and other events beyond our control. In addition, our technology,infrastructure and processes may contain undetected errors or design faults which may cause ourwebsites or operating systems to fail. The failure of our systems could adversely affect ourbusiness, results of operations and prospects.     We may be unable to protect our rights in intellectual property.     We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret and patent protection,and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks, software and otherintellectual property. These protective measures afford only limited protection. Despite ourefforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate ourintellectual property or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products andservices which do not infringe on our intellectual property rights. We may be required to spendsignificant resources to protect our trade secrets and to monitor and police our intellectualproperty rights. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforceintellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete.     We are dependent upon third party providers for certain significant information technologyneeds.     We have entered into agreements with third party providers for information technologyservices, including telecommunications and network server services. In the event that one or moreof these providers is not able to provide adequate or timely information technology services, wecould be adversely affected. Although we believe that information technology services are availablefrom numerous sources, a failure to perform by one or more of our service providers could cause adisruption in our business while we obtain an alternative source of supply. In addition, the use ofsubstitute third party providers could result in increased expense.     Legislation relating to consumer privacy protection could limit or harm our business.     We are subject to regulations implementing the privacy and information security requirementsof the federal financial modernization law known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and other federalregulation and state law on the same subject. These laws and regulations require us to develop,implement and maintain policies and procedures to protect the security and confidentiality ofconsumers nonpublic personal information. We are also subject to additionalrequirements in certain of our contracts with financial institution clients, which are often morerestrictive than the regulations. These regulations and agreements limit our ability to use ordisclose nonpublic personal information for other than the purposes originally intended. Thiscould have the effect of limiting business opportunities.     We are unable to predict whether more restrictive legislation or regulation will be adopted inthe future. Any future legislation or regulation, or the interpretation of existing legislation orregulation, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and prospects. Lawsand regulations may be adopted in the future with respect to the internet, e-commerce or marketingpractices generally relating to consumer privacy. Such laws or regulations may impede the growth ofthe internet and/or use of other sales or marketing vehicles. For example, new privacy laws coulddecrease traffic to our websites, decrease telemarketing opportunities and increase the cost ofobtaining new customers.17      We may be subject to sales and other taxes which could have an adverse effect on our business.     In accordance with existing state and local tax laws, we currently collect sales, use or othersimilar taxes in state and local jurisdictions where we have a physical presence. One or more stateor local jurisdiction may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state companieswhich engage in remote or online commerce. Further, tax law and the interpretation ofconstitutional limitations thereon is subject to change. In addition, any new operations in stateswhere we do not currently have a physical presence could subject shipments of goods by ourdirect-to-consumer businesses into such states to sales tax under current or future laws. If one ormore state or local jurisdiction successfully asserts that we should have collected sales or othertaxes in the past but did not, or that we must collect sales or other taxes in the future beyondour current practices, either determination could have a material, adverse affect on our business.     We may be subject to environmental risks.     Our printing facilities are subject to many federal and state regulations designed to protectthe environment. We have sold former printing facilities to third parties, and in some instances,have agreed to indemnify the buyer of the facility for certain environmental liabilities.Unforeseen conditions at these facilities could result in additional liability and expense beyondour insurance coverage"
3,DLX,DELUXE CORP,2008-02-22,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.     Our business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could beadversely affected by various risks and uncertainties. These risks include, but are not limited to,the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form10-K. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may alsoimpair our business, results of operations and financial condition. You should carefully considerall of these risks.     The check printing portion of the payments industry is mature and, if check usage declinesfaster than expected, it could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results.     Check printing is, and is expected to continue to be, an essential part of our business,representing 65.1% of our consolidated revenue in 2007. We primarily sell checks for personal andsmall business use and believe that there will continue to be a substantial demand for these checksfor the foreseeable future. However, the total number of checks written in the United States hasbeen in decline since the mid-1990s. According to our estimates, the total number of checks writtenby individuals has continued to decline approximately four to five percent each year and checkswritten by small businesses have declined two to four percent each year over the past three years.We believe that the number of checks written will continue to decline due to the increasing use ofalternative payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, automated teller machines, directdeposit and electronic and other bill paying services. However, the rate and the extent to whichalternative payment methods will achieve acceptance and replace checks, whether as a result oflegislative developments, personal preference or otherwise, cannot be predicted with certainty. Asurge in the popularity of any of these alternative payment methods, or our inability tosuccessfully offset the decline in check usage with other sources of revenue, could have a materialadverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects.     We face intense competition in all areas of our business.     Although we are one of the leading check printers in the United States, we face considerablecompetition. In addition to competition from alternative payment systems, we also face intensecompetition from another check printer in our traditional financial institution sales channel, fromdirect mail sellers of personal checks, from sellers of business checks and forms, from checkprinting software vendors and from internet-based sellers of checks to individuals and smallbusinesses. Additionally, low price, high volume office supply chain stores offer standardizedbusiness forms, checks and related products to small businesses. We can provide no assurance thatwe will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. Continuedcompetition could result in additional price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of customersand an increase in up-front cash payments to financial institutions upon contract execution orrenewal.     In May 2007, our two primary competitors in the check printing portion of the paymentsindustry merged and are now doing business as Harland ClarkeTM. As this is a recentmerger, the impact, if any, it may have on competition remains uncertain.     We may not be successful at implementing our growth strategies within Small Business Services.     We continue to execute strategies intended to drive sustained growth within Small BusinessServices. We continue to promote our Deluxe Business AdvantageSM program and intend toexpand sales to new and existing customers, develop models to tailor our marketing approach to eachcustomer and further integrate our field sales, marketing and call center functions across thecompany. We continue to assess our branding strategy and improve our ecommerce and merchandisingstrategies. All of these initiatives have required and will continue to require investment. SmallBusiness Services revenue increased in 2007, as compared to 2006, excluding the impact of the saleof our industrial packaging product line in January 2007. We can provide no assurance that ourgrowth strategies will continue to be successful in the long-term and result in a positive returnon our investment.     Our ability to reduce costs is critical to our success.     We intend to continue to reduce expenses, primarily within our shared services functions. Wealso expect to continue to simplify our business processes and reduce our cost and expensestructure. These initiatives have required and will continue to require up-front13Table of Contentsexpenditures related to items such asredesigning and streamlining processes, consolidating information technology platforms,standardizing technology applications and improving real estate utilization. We can provide noassurance that we will achieve our anticipated cost reductions or that we will do so withoutincurring unexpected or greater than anticipated expenditures. Moreover, we may find that we areunable to achieve our business simplification and cost reduction goals without disruption to ourbusiness and as a result, we may choose to delay or forego certain cost reductions as businessconditions require.     Consolidation among financial institutions has, and may continue to, adversely affect thepricing of our products and may result in the loss of clients.     The number of financial institutions has declined due to consolidation in the financialservices industry. Margin pressures arise from such consolidation as merged entities seek to reducecosts by leveraging economies of scale, including their check supply contracts. The increase ingeneral negotiating leverage possessed by such consolidated entities has resulted in contractswhich are not as favorable to us as those historically negotiated with these clients, and in somecases, has resulted in the loss of clients to competitors. Although we devote considerable efforttoward the development of a competitively-priced, high-quality suite of products and services forthe financial services industry, there can be no assurance that significant financial institutionclients will be retained or that the loss of a significant client can be offset through theaddition of new clients or by expanded sales to our remaining clients.     Continuing softness in direct mail response rates could have a further adverse impact on ouroperating results.     Our Direct Checks segment and portions of our Small Business Services segment have experienceddeclines in response and retention rates related to direct mail promotional materials. We believethat media response rates are declining across a wide variety of products and services.Additionally, we believe that our declines are attributable to the general decline in check usageand the gradual obsolescence of standardized forms products. To offset these impacts, we continueto modify our marketing and sales efforts. We may not succeed in offsetting the decline in responserates, even with additional marketing and sales efforts.     The profitability of our Direct Checks segment depends in large part on our ability to secureadequate advertising media placements at acceptable rates, as well as the consumer response ratesgenerated by such advertising. We can provide no assurance regarding the future cost, effectivenessand/or availability of suitable advertising media. Consumers may not continue to respond to suchadvertising at the same rates, and competitive pressure may inhibit our ability to reflectincreased costs in the prices of our products. We may not be able to sustain our current levels ofprofitability in this situation.     Small Business Services standardized business forms and related products face technologicalobsolescence and changing customer preferences.     Continual technological improvements have provided small business customers with alternativemeans to enact and record business transactions. For example, because of the lower price and higherperformance capabilities of personal computers and related printers, small businesses now have analternate means to print many business forms. Additionally, electronic transaction systems andoff-the-shelf business software applications have been designed to automate many of the functionsperformed by business forms products. If small business preferences change rapidly and we areunable to develop new products and services with comparable profit margins, our results ofoperations could be adversely affected.     We face uncertainty with respect to recent and future acquisitions.     We acquired the Johnson Group in October 2006 and All Trade Computer Forms, Inc. in February2007 with the intent to expand our business with custom, full-color, digital and web-to-printcapabilities. The integration of any acquisition involves numerous risks, including: difficultiesin assimilating operations and products; diversion of managements attention from other businessconcerns; potential loss of key employees; potential exposure to unknown liabilities; and possibleloss of our clients and customers or the clients and customers of the acquired businesses. One ormore of these factors could impact our ability to successfully integrate an acquisition and couldnegatively affect our results of operations.14Table of Contents     With regards to future acquisitions, we cannot predict whether suitable acquisition candidatescan be acquired on acceptable terms or whether any acquired products, technologies or businesseswill contribute to our revenue or earnings to any material extent. Significant acquisitionstypically result in additional contingent liabilities or debt and/or additional amortizationexpense related to acquired intangible assets, and thus, could adversely affect our business,results of operations and financial condition.     The cost and availability of materials, delivery services and energy could adversely affectour operating results.     We are subject to risks associated with the cost and availability of paper, plastics, ink, other rawmaterials, delivery services and energy. Postal rates increased in 2007 and fuel costs havecontinued to increase over the past several years. Competitive pressures and/or contractualarrangements inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the prices of our products.     Paper costs represent a significant portion of our materials cost. Historically, we have notbeen negatively impacted by paper shortages because of our relationships with various papersuppliers. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to purchase sufficientquantities of paper if such a shortage were to occur. Additionally, we depend upon third partyproviders for delivery services. Events resulting in the inability of these service providers toperform their obligations, such as extended labor strikes, could adversely impact our results ofoperations by requiring us to secure alternate providers at higher costs.     Forecasts involving future results reflect various assumptions that may prove to be incorrect.     From time to time, we make predictions or forecasts regarding our future results, including,but not limited to, forecasts regarding estimated revenue, earnings, earnings per share oroperating cash flow. Any forecast regarding our future performance reflects various assumptionswhich are subject to significant uncertainties, and, as a matter of course, may prove to beincorrect. Further, the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous factors which are beyondour control. As a result, we cannot assure you that our performance will be consistent with anymanagement forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse.You are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolatedpredictions, and are encouraged to use the entire mix of historical and forward-looking informationmade available by us, and other information affecting us and our products and services, includingthe factors discussed here.     In addition, independent analysts periodically publish reports regarding our projected futureperformance. The methodologies we employ in arriving at our own internal projections and theapproaches taken by independent analysts in making their estimates are likely different in manysignificant respects. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to advise analysts or the publicmarkets of our views regarding the accuracy of the published estimates of independent analysts. Ifyou are relying on these estimates, you should pursue your own investigation and analysis of theiraccuracy and the reasonableness of the assumptions on which they are based.     General economic conditions within the United States could have an adverse effect on ouroperating results.     The rate of small business formations, small business confidence, consumer spending andemployment levels, as well as higher fuel costs, all have an impact on our businesses. We estimatethat lower than average small business optimism and a decline in small business formationsnegatively impacted our results of operations in Small Business Services in the latter half of2007, and we expect this trend to continue into the first half of 2008. Although consumer spendingand employment levels both trended negatively during the last half of 2007, we did not experience asignificant negative impact in our personal check businesses. A prolonged downturn in generaleconomic conditions could result in additional declines in our revenue and profitability. Inaddition, the recent turmoil in the financial services industry related to subprime lendingactivities may cause financial institutions to seek additional concessions from their vendors.15Table of Contents     Security breaches involving customer data, or the perception that e-commerce is not secure,could adversely affect our reputation and business.     We rely on various security procedures and systems to ensure the secure storage andtransmission of data. Computer networks and the internet are, by nature, vulnerable to unauthorizedaccess. We cannot provide assurance that misuse of new technologies or advances in criminalcapabilities will not compromise or breach our security procedures and systems resulting inunauthorized access and/or use of customer data, including consumers nonpublic personalinformation. A security breach could damage our reputation, deter clients and consumers fromordering our products and result in claims against us. If we are unsuccessful in defending alawsuit regarding security breaches, we may be forced to pay damages which could have an adverseeffect on our operating results. Additionally, general publicity regarding security breaches atother companies could lead to the perception among the general public that e-commerce is notsecure. This could decrease traffic to our websites and foreclose future business opportunities.     We may be unable to protect our rights in intellectual property.     We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret and patent protection,and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks, software and otherintellectual property. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties mayinfringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or otherwise independently developsubstantially equivalent products and services which do not infringe on our intellectual propertyrights. We may be required to spend significant resources to protect our trade secrets and monitorand police our intellectual property rights. The loss of intellectual property protection or theinability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and abilityto compete. In addition, check designs exclusively licensed from third parties account for aportion of our revenue. These license agreements generally average three years in duration. Therecan be no guarantee that such licenses will be available to us indefinitely or at terms under whichwe can continue to generate a profit from the sale of licensed products.     We are dependent upon third party providers for certain significant information technologyneeds.     We have entered into agreements with third party providers for information technologyservices, including telecommunications and network server services. In the event that one or moreof these providers is not able to provide adequate or timely information technology services, wecould be adversely affected. Although we believe that information technology services are availablefrom numerous sources, a failure to perform by one or more of our service providers could cause adisruption in our business while we obtain an alternative source of supply.

These laws and regulations require us to develop,implement and maintain policies and procedures to protect the security and confidentiality ofconsumers nonpublic personal information and to disclose these policies to consumers before acustomer relationship is established and annually thereafter. These regulations could have theeffect of limiting business initiatives.     We are unable to predict whether more restrictive legislation or regulation will be adopted inthe future. Any future legislation or regulation, or the interpretation of existing legislation orregulation, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations or prospects. Lawsand regulations may be adopted in the future with respect to the internet, e-commerce or marketingpractices generally relating to consumer privacy. Such laws or regulations may impede the growth ofthe internet and/or use of other sales or marketing vehicles. For example, new privacy laws coulddecrease traffic to our websites, decrease telemarketing opportunities and increase the cost ofobtaining new customers.     If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and other qualified employees, ourbusiness could suffer.     Our success at efforts to grow our business and reduce costs depends on the contributions andabilities of key executives, operating officers and other personnel. If we are unable to retain ourexisting employees and attract qualified personnel, we may not be able to manage our16Table of Contentsbusiness effectively. Competition for employees infields such as information technology, finance, sales, product management and customer service isintense, and we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retainingsuch personnel.     We may be subject to sales and other taxes which could have an adverse effect on our business.     In accordance with current federal, state and local tax laws, we currently collect sales, useor other similar taxes in state and local jurisdictions where our businesses have a physicalpresence. One or more state or local jurisdiction may seek to impose sales tax collectionobligations on out-of-state companies which engage in remote or online commerce. Further, tax lawand the interpretation of constitutional limitations thereon are subject to change. In addition,any new operations in states where we do not currently have a physical presence could subjectshipments of goods by our direct-to-consumer businesses into such states to sales tax under currentor future laws.

You should carefully consider all of these risks. The check printing portion of the payments industry is mature and, if check usage declines faster than expected, it could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results.  Check printing is, and is expectedto continue to be, an essential part of our business, representing 63.5% of our revenue in 2006. We primarily sell checks forpersonal and small business use and believe that there will continue to be a substantial demand for these checks for theforeseeable future. However, the total number of checks written in the United States has been in decline since the mid-1990s.According to our estimates, the total number of checks written by individuals has continued to decline approximately four to fivepercent each year and checks written by small businesses have declined two to three percent each year over the past three years. Webelieve that the number of checks written will continue to decline due to the increasing use of alternative payment methods,including credit cards, debit cards, smart cards, automated teller machines, direct deposit, electronic and other bill payingservices, home banking applications and internet-based payment services. However, the rate and the extent to which alternativepayment methods will achieve consumer acceptance and replace checks, whether as a result of legislative developments, personalpreference or otherwise, cannot be predicted with certainty. A surge in the popularity of any of these alternative payment methodscould have a material adverse effect on the demand for checks and a material adverse effect on our business, results of operationsand prospects.  We face intense competition in all areas of our business.  Although we are the leading check printer in the United States, we face considerable competition. In addition to competition from alternative payment systems, we also face intense competition from other check printers in our traditional financial institution sales channel, from direct mail sellers of checks, from sellers of business checks and forms, from check printing software vendors and from internet-based sellers of checks to individuals and small businesses. Additionally, low-price, high volume office supply chain stores offer standardized business forms, checks and related products to small businesses. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. Continued competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of customers and an increase in up-front cash payments to financial institutions uponcontract execution or renewal.  In late December 2006, our two primary competitors in the check printing portion of the payments industry announced a merger plan, which is subject to regulatory approval. If successful, the merger will consolidate two of the largest check printers in the United States. We are uncertain as to how this planned merger will impact competition for our check printing businesses. We may not be successful at implementing our growth strategies within Small Business Services.We continue to execute strategies intended to drive sustained growth within Small Business Services. We launched our Deluxe Business AdvantageSM  program in 2005, expanded our sales and call center staffs, provided training to sales personnel with the intent of expanding sales to new and existing customers, developed a model to tailor our marketing approach to each customer and further integrated our field sales, marketing and call center functions across the company. All of these initiatives require investment. While Small Business Services revenue did increase in 2006, as compared to 2005, we can provide no assurance that our growth strategies will continue to be successful in the long-term and result in a positive return on our investment. Our ability to reduce costs is critical to our success. We intend to reduce expenses, primarily within our shared services functions. We also intend to simplify our business processes within Financial Services and shared services, with the intention of generating further cost savings. These initiatives require up-front expenditures related to items such as redesigning and streamlining processes and improving asset utilization and productivity. We can provide no assurance that these expenditures will  11not exceed our expectations or that we will be successful at reducing our costs. Moreover, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to achieve our business simplification and cost reduction goals without disruption to our business and therefore, we may choose to delay or forego certain cost reductions as business conditions require. Consolidation among financial institutions has, and may continue to, adversely affect the pricing of our products.  The number of financial institutions has declined due to large-scale consolidation. Margin pressures arise from such consolidation as merged entities seek to reduce costs by leveraging economies of scale in purchasing, including their check supply contracts. This increases the importance of retaining our major financial institution clients and attracting additional clients in an increasingly competitive environment. The increase in general negotiating leverage possessed by such consolidated entities typically results in new and/or renewed contracts which are not as favorable as those historically negotiated with these clients. Although we devote considerable effort toward the development of a competitively-priced, high-quality suite of products and services for the financial services industry, there can be no assurance that significant financial institution clients will be retained or thatthe loss of a significant client can be offset through the addition of new clients or by expanded sales to our remaining clients.  Continuing softness in direct mail response rates could have a further adverse impact on our operating results. Our Direct Checks segment and portions of our Small Business Services segment have experienced declines in response and retention rates related to direct mail promotional materials. We believe that media response rates are declining across a wide variety of products and services. Additionally, we believe that our declines are attributable to the decline in check usage, the gradual obsolescence of standardized forms products and an increase in financial institutions offering free checks to consumers. To offset these impacts, we may have to modify and/or further increase our marketing and sales efforts, which could result in increased expense. The profitability of our Direct Checks segment depends in large part on our ability to secure adequate advertising media placements at acceptable rates, as well as the consumer response rates generated by such advertising. We can provide no assurance regarding the future cost, effectiveness and/or availability of suitable advertising media. Competitive pressure may inhibit our ability to reflect any of these increased costs in the prices of our products. We may not be able to sustain our current levels of profitability in this situation. Standardized business forms and related products face technological obsolescence and changing customer preferences. Continual technological improvements have provided small business customers with alternative means to enact and record business transactions. For example, because of the lower price and higher performance capabilities of personal computers and related printers, small businesses now have an alternate means to print many business forms. Additionally, electronic transaction systems and off-the-shelf business software applications have been designed to automate many of the functions performed by business forms products. If small business customer preferences change rapidly and we are unable to develop new products and services with comparable profit margins, our results of operations could be adversely affected. We face uncertainty with respect to recent and future acquisitions.  We acquired NEBS in June 2004 and have stated that we expect growth in our Small Business Services segment as we implement the business strategies contemplated at the time of the acquisition. We also acquired the assets of Johnson Group and its affiliated companies in October 2006, with the intent to expand our business with custom, full-color, digital and web-to-print capabilities. The integration of any acquisition involves numerous risks, including:  difficulties in assimilating operations and products; diversion of managements attention from other business concerns; potential loss of our key employees or key employees of acquired businesses; potential exposure to unknown liabilities; and possible loss of our clients and customers or clients and customers of the acquired businesses. While we anticipate that we will be able to achieve our stated objectives, we can provide noassurance that one or more of these factors will not negatively impact our results of operations. 12With regards to future acquisitions, we cannot predict whether suitable acquisition candidates can be acquired on acceptable terms or whether any acquired products, technologies or businesses will contribute to our revenues or earnings to any material extent. Significant acquisitions typically result in additional contingent liabilities or debt, or additional amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, and thus, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Increased materials, delivery and advertising costs could adversely affect our operating results. We are subject to risks associated with the cost and availability of paper, ink, other raw materials and delivery services.

If you are relying on these estimates, you should pursue your own investigation and analysis of their accuracy and the reasonableness of the assumptions on which they are based. We may be unable to protect our rights in intellectual property. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products and services. In addition, designs licensed from third parties account for a portion of our revenues, and there can be no guarantee that such licenses will be available to us indefinitely or on terms that would allow us to continue to be profitable with those products. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete. We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks, software and know-how. We may be required to spend significant resources to protect our trade secrets and monitor andpolice our intellectual property rights. We are dependent upon third party providers for certain significant information technology needs.  We have entered into agreements with third party providers for information technology services, including personal computer, telecommunications, network server and help desk services. In the event that one or more of these providers is not able to provide adequate information technology services, we would be adversely affected. Although we believe that information technology services are available from numerous sources, a failure to perform by one or more of our service providers could cause a disruption in our business while we obtain an alternative source of supply.  13Legislation relating to consumer privacy protection could harm our business.  We are subject to regulations implementing the privacy and information security requirements of the federal financial modernization law known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and other federal regulation and state law on the same subject. These laws and regulations require us to develop, implement and maintain policies and procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of consumers nonpublic personal information and to disclose these policies to consumers before a customer relationship is established and annually thereafter. These regulations could have the effect of limiting future business initiatives. In addition, new technologies and higher criminal capabilities may breach or compromise the security of consumers nonpublic personal information. Violation of these laws and regulations could damage our business and negatively affect our reputation. More restrictive legislation or regulations have been introduced in the past and could be introduced in the future in Congress and the states. We are unable to predict whether more restrictive legislation or regulations will be adopted in the future. Any future legislation or regulations could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations or prospects. Laws and regulations may be adopted in the future with respect to the internet, e-commerce or marketing practices generally relating to consumer privacy. Such laws or regulations may impede the growth of the internet and/or use of other sales or marketing vehicles. As an example, new privacy laws could decrease traffic to our websites, decrease telemarketing opportunities and increase the cost of obtaining new customers. Additionally, the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing property ownership, taxation, libel and personal privacy is uncertain and may remain uncertain for a considerable length of time.  If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and other qualified employees, our business could suffer. Our success at efforts to grow our business and reduce costs depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives, operating officers and other personnel. If we are unable to retain our existing employees and attract qualified personnel, we may not be able to manage our business effectively. Competition for employees in fields such as information technology, sales and customer service is intense, and we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.  We may be subject to sales and other taxes which could have an adverse effect on our business.  In accordance with current federal, state and local tax laws, and the constitutional limitations thereon, we currently collect sales, use or other similar taxes in state and local jurisdictions where our direct-to-consumer businesses have a physical presence. One or more state or local jurisdictions may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on us and other out-of-state companies which engage in remote or online commerce. Further, tax law and the interpretation of constitutional limitations thereon are subject to change. In addition, any new operations of these businesses in states where they do not currently have a physical presence could subject shipments of goods by these businesses into such states to sales tax under current or future laws. If one or more state or local jurisdictions successfully asserts that we must collect sales or other taxes beyond our current practices, itcould have a material, adverse affect on our business.  We may be subject to environmental risks.  Our printing facilities are subject to many existing and proposed federal and state regulations designed to protect the environment. In some instances, we owned and operated our printing facilities before the environmental regulations came into existence. We have sold former printing facilities to third parties and in some instances have agreed to indemnify the buyer of the facility for certain environmental liabilities. We believe that, based on current information, we will not be required to incur additional material and uninsured expense with respect to these sites, but unforeseen conditions could result in additional exposure at lesser levels.  "

.         The check printing portionof the payments industry is mature and, if it declines faster than expected, it could have a materially adverse impact on ouroperating results.         Check printing is, and isexpected to continue to be, an essential part of our business, representing approximately 65% of our revenue in 2005. We primarilysell checks for personal and small business use and believe that there will continue to be a substantial demand for these checksfor the foreseeable future. However, according to our estimates, the total number of checks written by individuals and smallbusinesses continued to decline approximately four to five percent each year over the past three years, and the total number ofchecks written in the United States has been in decline since the mid-1990s. We believe that the number of checks written willcontinue to decline due to the increasing use of alternative payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, smart cards,automated teller machines, direct deposit, electronic and other bill paying services, home banking applicationsand internet-based payment services. However, the rate and the extent to which alternative payment methods will achieve consumeracceptance and replace checks, whether as a result of legislative developments, personal preference or otherwise, cannot bepredicted with certainty. A surge in the popularity of any of these alternative payment methods could have a material, adverseeffect on the demand for checks and a material, adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects. 9         We face intensecompetition in all areas of our business.         Although we are the leadingcheck printer in the United States, we face considerable competition. In addition to competition from alternative payment systems,we also face intense competition from other check printers in our traditional financial institution sales channel, from directmail sellers of checks, from sellers of business checks and forms, from check printing software vendors and from internet-basedsellers of checks to individuals and small businesses. Additionally, low-price, high volume office supply chain stores offerstandardized business forms, checks and related products to small businesses. We cannot assure you that we will be able to competeeffectively against current and future competitors. Continued competition could result in price reductions, reduced profitmargins, loss of customers and an increase in up-front cash payments to financial institutions upon contract execution or renewal.        Continuing softness indirect mail response rates could have a further adverse impact on our operating results.         Our Direct Checks segment andportions of our Small Business Services segment have experienced declines in response and retention rates related to direct mailpromotional materials. We believe that media response rates are declining across a wide variety of products and services.Additionally, we believe that our declines are attributable to the decline in check usage, the gradual obsolescence ofstandardized forms products and an increase in financial institutions offering free checks to consumers. To offset these impacts,we may have to modify and/or increase our marketing and sales efforts, which could result in increased expense.         The profitability of ourDirect Checks segment depends in large part on our ability to secure adequate advertising media placements at acceptable rates, aswell as the consumer response rates generated by such advertising, and there can be no assurances regarding the future cost,effectiveness and/or availability of suitable advertising media. Competitive pressure may inhibit our ability to reflect any ofthese increased costs in the prices of our products. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to sustain our currentlevels of profitability in this situation.         Consolidation amongfinancial institutions may adversely affect the pricing of our products.         The number of financialinstitutions has declined due to large-scale consolidation in the last few years. Margin pressures arise from such consolidationas merged entities seek to reduce costs by leveraging economies of scale in purchasing, including their check supply contracts.This increases the importance of retaining our major financial institution clients and attracting additional clients in anincreasingly competitive environment. The increase in general negotiating leverage possessed by such consolidated entitiestypically results in new and/or renewed contracts which are not as favorable as those historically negotiated with these clients.Although we devote considerable effort toward the development of a competitively priced, high quality suite of products andservices for the financial services industry, there can be no assurance that significant financial institution clients will beretained or that the loss of a significant client can be counterbalanced through the addition of new clients or by expanded salesto our remaining clients.         Standardized businessforms and related products face technological obsolescence and changing customer preferences.         Continual technologicalimprovements have provided small business customers with alternative means to enact and record business transactions. For example,because of the lower price and higher performance capabilities of personal computers and related printers, small businesses nowhave an alternate means to print business forms. Additionally, electronic transaction systems and off-the-shelf business softwareapplications have been designed to automate several of the functions performed by business forms products. If small businesscustomer preferences change rapidly and we are unable to develop new products and services with comparable profit margins, ourresults of operations could be adversely affected.         Our failure tosuccessfully implement a project we have undertaken to replace major portions of our existing order capture, billing and pricingsystems would negatively impact our business.         During 2006, we will continueto expand our use of the SAP software platform with the planned installation of the SAP sales and distribution module in a portionof our business. Once implemented, we expect the new system to reduce redundancy while standardizing systems and processes andreducing our costs. This is a significant information systems project with wide-reaching impacts on our internal operations andbusiness. We can provide no assurance that the amount of this investment will not exceed our expectations and result in materiallyincreased levels of expense or asset impairment charges. There is also no assurance that this initiative will achieve the expectedcost savings or result in a positive return on our investment. Additionally, if the new system does not operate as intended, or isnot implemented as planned, there could be disruptions in our business which could adversely affect our results. 10         We face uncertainty withrespect to recent and future acquisitions.         We acquired NEBS in June 2004and have stated that we expect growth in our Small Business Services segment as we implement the business strategies contemplatedat the time of the acquisition. The integration of any acquisition involves numerous risks, including, among others, difficultiesin assimilating operations and products, diversion of managements attention from other business concerns, potential loss ofour key employees or key employees of acquired businesses, potential exposure to unknown liabilities and possible loss of ourclients and customers or clients and customers of the acquired businesses. While we anticipate that we will be able to achieve ourstated objectives, we can provide no assurance that one or more of these factors will not negatively impact our results ofoperations.         In regard to futureacquisitions, we cannot predict whether suitable acquisition candidates can be acquired on acceptable terms or whether anyacquired products, technologies or businesses will contribute to our revenues or earnings to any material extent. Significantacquisitions typically result in the incurrence of contingent liabilities or debt, or additional amortization expense related toacquired intangible assets, and thus, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.        Costs incurred toimplement our growth strategies within Small Business Services may exceed our expectations.         As we execute our growthstrategies within Small Business Services, we will incur additional costs, such as hiring and supporting a significant number ofsales and call center personnel in early 2006. We can provide no assurance that these costs will not significantly exceed ourexpectations or that we will be able to hire enough qualified candidates to meet our sales targets. Additionally, we can provideno assurance that our strategy to expand sales to new and existing customers will be successful and result in a positive return onour investment.        Forecasts involving futureresults reflect various assumptions that may prove to be incorrect.         From time to time, we makepredictions or forecasts regarding our future results, including, but not limited to, forecasts regarding estimated revenues,earnings, earnings per share or operating cash flow. Any forecast regarding our future performance reflects various assumptionswhich are subject to significant uncertainties, and, as a matter of course, may prove to be incorrect. Further, the achievement ofany forecast depends on numerous factors which are beyond our control. As a result, we cannot assure you that our performance willbe consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse. You arecautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated predictions, and are encouraged to use theentire mix of historical and forward-looking information made available by us, and other information affecting us and our productsand services, including the factors discussed here.         In addition, independentanalysts periodically publish reports regarding our projected future performance. The methodologies we employ in arriving at ourown internal projections and the approaches taken by independent analysts in making their estimates are likely different in manysignificant respects. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to advise analysts or the public markets of our views regarding theaccuracy of the published estimates of independent analysts. If you are relying on these estimates, you should pursue your owninvestigation and analysis of their accuracy and the reasonableness of the assumptions on which they are based.         We may be unable toprotect our rights in intellectual property.         Despite our efforts toprotect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or otherwiseindependently develop substantially equivalent products and services. In addition, designs licensed from third parties account fora portion of our revenues, and there can be no guarantee that such licenses will be available to us indefinitely or on terms thatwould allow us to continue to be profitable with those products. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability tosecure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete. We rely on a combination oftrademark and copyright laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks,software and know-how. We may be required to spend significant resources to protect our trade secrets and monitor and police ourintellectual property rights.         We are dependent uponthird party providers for certain significant information technology needs.         We have entered intoagreements with third party providers for information technology services, including software development and support services,and personal computer, telecommunications, network server and help desk services. In the event that one or more of these providersis not able to provide adequate information technology  11 services, we would be adversely affected. Although we believe thatinformation technology services are available from numerous sources, a failure to perform by one or more of our service providerscould cause a disruption in our business while we obtain an alternative source of supply.        Legislationrelating to consumer privacy protection could harm our business.         We are subject to regulationsimplementing the privacy and information security requirements of the federal financial modernization law known as theGramm-Leach-Bliley Act and other federal regulation and state law on the same subject. These laws and regulations require us todevelop and implement policies to protect the security and confidentiality of consumers nonpublic personal information andto disclose these policies to consumers before a customer relationship is established and annually thereafter. These regulationscould have the effect of foreclosing future business initiatives. In addition, new technologies and higher criminal capabilitiesmay breach or compromise the security of consumers nonpublic personal information.         More restrictive legislationor regulations have been introduced in the past and could be introduced in the future in Congress and the states. We are unable topredict whether more restrictive legislation or regulations will be adopted in the future. Any future legislation or regulationscould have a negative impact on our business, results of operations or prospects.         Laws and regulations may beadopted in the future with respect to the internet, e-commerce or marketing practices generally relating to consumer privacy. Suchlaws or regulations may impede the growth of the internet and/or use of other sales or marketing vehicles. As an example, newprivacy laws could decrease traffic to our websites, decrease telemarketing opportunities and increase the cost of obtaining newcustomers. Additionally, the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing property ownership, taxation, libel andpersonal privacy is uncertain and may remain uncertain for a considerable length of time.         We may be subject to salesand other taxes which could have adverse effects on our business.         In accordance with currentfederal, state and local tax laws, and the constitutional limitations thereon, we currently collect sales, use or other similartaxes in state and local jurisdictions where our direct-to-consumer businesses have a physical presence. One or more state orlocal jurisdictions may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on us and other out-of-state companies which engage inremote or online commerce. Further, tax law and the interpretation of constitutional limitations thereon are subject to change. Inaddition, any new operations of these businesses in states where they do not currently have a physical presence could subjectshipments of goods by these businesses into such states to sales tax under current or future laws. If one or more state or localjurisdictions successfully asserts that we must collect sales or other taxes beyond our current practices, it could have amaterial, adverse affect on our business.         Wemay be subject to environmental risks.         Our printing facilities aresubject to many existing and proposed federal and state regulations designed to protect the environment. In some instances, weowned and operated our printing facilities before the environmental regulations came into existence. We have sold former printingfacilities to third parties and in some instances have agreed to indemnify the buyer of the facility for certain environmentalliabilities. We have obtained insurance coverage related to environmental issues at certain of these facilities. We believe that,based on current information, we will not be required to incur additional material and uninsured expense with respect to thesesites, but unforeseen conditions could result in additional exposure at lesser levels"
