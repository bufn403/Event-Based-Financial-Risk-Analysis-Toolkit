.In addition to other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company’s business. The Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.8Risks Related to Our BusinessThe Company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or unavailability or shortages of raw materials, fuel and other supplies.Raw material costs, including the costs for plastic bottles, aluminum cans, PET resin, carbon dioxide and high fructose corn syrup, are subject to significant price volatility, which may be worsened by periods of increased demand, supply constraints or high inflation. International or domestic geopolitical or other events, including pandemics, armed conflict or the imposition of tariffs and/or quotas by the U.S. government on any of these raw materials, could adversely impact the supply and cost of these raw materials to the Company or render them unavailable at commercially favorable terms or at all. In addition, there are no limits on the prices The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies can charge for concentrate. If the Company cannot offset higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, effective commodity price hedging, increased sales volume or reductions in other costs, the Company’s results of operations and profitability could be adversely affected.The Company uses significant amounts of fuel for its delivery fleet and other vehicles used in the distribution of its products. International or domestic geopolitical or other events could impact the supply and cost of fuel and the timely delivery of the Company’s products to its customers. Although the Company strives to reduce fuel consumption and uses commodity hedges to manage the Company’s fuel costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting the impact of fuel price increases or price volatility on the Company’s business or future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations.The Company uses a combination of internal and external freight shipping and transportation services to transport and deliver products. The Company’s freight cost and the timely delivery of its products may be adversely impacted by a number of factors that could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations, including driver shortages, reduced availability of independent contractor drivers, higher fuel costs, weather conditions, traffic congestion, increased government regulation and other matters.The Company continues to make significant reinvestments in its business in order to evolve its operating model and to accommodate future growth and portfolio expansion, including supply chain optimization. The increased costs associated with these reinvestments, the potential for disruption in manufacturing and distribution and the risk the Company may not realize a satisfactory return on its investments could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.The reliance on purchased finished products from external sources could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability.The Company does not, and does not plan to, manufacture all of the products it distributes and, therefore, remains reliant on purchased finished products from external sources to meet customer demand. As a result, the Company is subject to incremental risk, including, but not limited to, product quality and availability, price variability and production capacity shortfalls for externally purchased finished products, which could have an impact on the Company’s profitability and customer relationships. Particularly, the Company is subject to the risk of unavailability of still products that it acquires from other manufacturers, leading to an inability to meet consumer demand for these products. In most instances, the Company’s ability to negotiate the prices at which it purchases finished products from other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers is limited pursuant to The Coca‑Cola Company’s right to unilaterally establish the prices, or certain elements of the formulas used to determine the prices, for such finished products under the RMA, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability.Changes in public and consumer perception and preferences, including concerns related to product safety and sustainability, artificial ingredients, brand reputation and obesity, could reduce demand for the Company’s products and reduce profitability.Concerns about perceived negative safety and quality consequences of certain ingredients in the Company’s products, such as non-nutritive sweeteners or ingredients in energy drinks, may erode consumers’ confidence in the safety and quality of the Company’s products, whether or not justified. The Company’s business is also impacted by changes in consumer concerns or perceptions surrounding the product manufacturing processes and packaging materials, including single-use and other plastic packaging, and the environmental and sustainability impact of such manufacturing processes and packaging materials. Any of these factors may reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase the Company’s products and any inability on the part of the Company to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for the Company’s products or erode the Company’s competitive and financial position and could adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.The Company’s success depends on its ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of its products. The Company has rigorous product safety and quality standards. However, if beverage products taken to market are or become contaminated or adulterated, the Company may be required to conduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which could cause its business and reputation to suffer.9The Company’s success also depends in large part on its ability and the ability of The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies it works with to maintain the brand image of existing products, build up brand image for new products and brand extensions and maintain its corporate reputation and social license to operate. Engagements by the Company’s executives in social and public policy debates may occasionally be the subject of criticism from advocacy groups that have differing points of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. Similarly, the Company’s sponsorship relationships and charitable giving program could subject the Company to negative publicity as a result of actual or perceived views of organizations the Company sponsors or supports financially. Likewise, negative postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company, The Coca‑Cola Company or one of the products the Company carries, even if inaccurate or malicious, could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of the Company’s brands or the Company.The Company’s business depends substantially on consumer tastes, preferences and shopping habits that change in often unpredictable ways. As a result of certain health and wellness trends, including concern over the public health consequences associated with obesity, consumer preferences over the past several years have shifted from sugar-sweetened sparkling beverages to diet sparkling beverages, tea, sports drinks, enhanced water and bottled water. As the Company distributes, markets and manufactures beverage brands owned by others, the success of the Company’s business depends in large measure on the ability of The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies to develop and introduce product innovations to meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market, and failure to satisfy these consumer preferences could adversely affect the Company’s profitability.Changes in government regulations related to nonalcoholic beverages, including regulations related to obesity, public health, artificial ingredients and product safety and sustainability, could reduce demand for the Company’s products and reduce profitability.The Company’s business and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those governing the production, packaging, quality, labeling and distribution of beverage products. Compliance with or changes in existing laws or regulations could require material expenses and negatively affect our financial results through lower sales or higher costs.The production and marketing of beverages are subject to the rules and regulations of the FDA and other federal, state and local health agencies, and extensive changes in these rules and regulations could increase the Company’s costs or adversely impact its sales. The Company cannot predict whether any such rules or regulations will be enacted or, if enacted, the impact that such rules or regulations could have on its business.In response to growing health, nutrition and wellness concerns for today’s youth, a number of state and local governments have regulations restricting the sale of soft drinks and other foods in schools, particularly elementary, middle and high schools. Many of these restrictions have existed for several years in connection with subsidized meal programs in schools. Additionally, legislation has been proposed by certain state and local governments to limit or restrict the sale of energy drinks to minors and/or persons below a specified age and/or to restrict the venues in which energy drinks can be sold. Restrictive legislation, if widely enacted, could have an adverse impact on the Company’s products, sales and reputation.Legislation has been proposed in Congress and by certain state and local governments which would prohibit the sale of soft drink products in non-refillable bottles and cans or require a mandatory deposit as a means of encouraging the return of such containers, each in an attempt to reduce solid waste and litter. Similarly, the Company is aware of proposed legislation that would impose fees or taxes on various types of containers that are used in its business, implement new recycling regulations and the reduction of single-use plastics and place the onus on plastic suppliers to identify recycling solutions. The Company is not currently impacted by the policies in these types of proposed legislation, but it is possible that similar or more restrictive legal requirements may be proposed or enacted within its distribution territories in the future.Concerns about perceived negative safety and quality consequences of certain ingredients in the Company’s products, such as non-nutritive sweeteners or ingredients in energy drinks, could result in additional governmental regulations concerning the production, marketing, labeling or availability of the Company’s products or the ingredients in such products, possible new taxes or negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against the Company or other companies in the same industry, any of which could damage the reputation of the Company or reduce demand for the Company’s products, which could adversely affect the Company’s profitability.The FDA occasionally proposes major changes to the nutrition labels required on all packaged foods and beverages, including those for most of the Company’s products, which could require the Company and its competitors to revise nutrition labels to include updated serving sizes, information about total calories in a beverage product container and information about any added sugars or nutrients. Any pervasive nutrition label changes could increase the Company’s costs and could inhibit sales of one or more of the Company’s major products.10Most beverage products sold by the Company are classified as food or food products and are therefore eligible for purchase using SNAP benefits by consumers purchasing them for home consumption. Energy drinks with a nutrition facts label are also classified as food and are eligible for purchase for home consumption using SNAP benefits, whereas energy drinks classified as a supplement by the FDA are not. Regulators may restrict the use of benefit programs, including SNAP, to purchase certain beverages and foods currently classified as food or food products.The Company relies on The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies to invest in the Company through marketing funding and to promote their own company brand identity through external advertising, marketing spending and product innovation. Decreases from historic levels of investment could negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations or profitability.The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies have historically provided financial support to the Company through marketing funding. While the Company does not believe there will be significant changes to the amount of marketing funding support provided by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies, the Company’s beverage agreements generally do not obligate such funding and there can be no assurance the historic levels will continue. Decreases in the level of marketing funding provided, material changes in the marketing funding programs’ performance requirements or the Company’s inability to meet the performance requirements for marketing funding could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations or profitability.In addition, The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies have their own external advertising campaigns, marketing spending and product innovation programs, which directly impact the Company’s operations. Decreases in advertising, marketing and product innovation spending by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies, or advertising campaigns that are negatively perceived by the public, could adversely impact the sales volume growth and profitability of the Company. While the Company does not believe there will be significant changes in the level of external advertising and marketing spending by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies, there can be no assurance the historic levels will continue or that advertising campaigns will be positively perceived by the public. The Company’s volume growth is also dependent on product innovation by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies, and their ability to develop and introduce products that meet consumer preferences.The Company is a participant in several Coca‑Cola system governance entities, and decisions made by these governance entities may be different than decisions that would have been made by the Company individually. Any failure of these governance entities to function efficiently or on the best behalf of the Company and any failure or delay of the Company to receive anticipated benefits from these governance entities could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company is a member of CONA and party to an amended and restated master services agreement with CONA, pursuant to which the Company is an authorized user of the CONA System, a uniform information technology system developed to promote operational efficiency and uniformity among North American Coca‑Cola bottlers. The Company relies on CONA to make necessary upgrades to and resolve ongoing or disaster-related technology issues with the CONA System, and it is limited in its authority and ability to timely resolve errors or to make changes to the CONA software. Any service interruptions of the CONA System could result in increased costs or adversely impact the Company’s results of operations. In addition, because other Coca‑Cola bottlers are also users of the CONA System and would likely experience similar service interruptions, the Company may not be able to have another bottler process orders on its behalf during any such interruption.The Company is also a member of the NPSG, which is comprised of The Coca‑Cola Company, the Company and certain other Coca‑Cola bottlers who are regional producing bottlers in The Coca‑Cola Company’s national product supply system. Subject to the terms and conditions of the NPSG Agreement, the Company is required to comply with certain key decisions made by the NPSG Board, which include decisions regarding strategic infrastructure investment and divestment planning, optimal national product supply sourcing and new product or packaging infrastructure planning. Although the Company has a representative on the NPSG Board, the Company cannot exercise sole decision-making authority relating to the decisions of the NPSG Board, and the interests of other members of the NPSG Board may diverge from those of the Company. Any such divergence could have a material adverse effect on the operating and financial results of the Company.Provisions in the CBA and the RMA with The Coca‑Cola Company could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or a sale of the Company’s Coca‑Cola distribution or manufacturing businesses.Provisions in the CBA and the RMA require the Company to obtain The Coca‑Cola Company’s prior approval of a potential buyer of the Company’s Coca‑Cola distribution or manufacturing businesses, which could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or the Company’s ability to sell such businesses. The Company can obtain a list of pre-approved third-party buyers from The Coca‑Cola Company annually. In addition, the Company can seek buyer-specific approval from The Coca‑Cola Company upon receipt of a third-party offer to purchase the Company or its Coca‑Cola distribution or manufacturing businesses. If a change in control 11or sale of one of our businesses is delayed or prevented by the provisions in the CBA and the RMA, the market price of our Common Stock could be negatively affected.The concentration of the Company’s capital stock ownership with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer limits other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters.As of December 31, 2023, J. Frank Harrison, III, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, controlled 1,004,394 shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock, which represented approximately 71% of the total voting power of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on a consolidated basis. Mr. Harrison also has the right to acquire 292,386 shares of Class B Common Stock from the Company in exchange for an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock. In the event of such an exchange, Mr. Harrison would control 1,296,780 shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock, which would represent approximately 76% of the total voting power of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on a consolidated basis. Furthermore, Mr. Harrison and another member of the Harrison family serve on the Company’s Board of Directors. As a result, Mr. Harrison has the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over the Company’s management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by the Company’s stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of the Company or its assets. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control otherwise favored by the Company’s other stockholders and could depress the stock price or limit other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters, which could result in the Company making decisions that stockholders outside the Harrison family may not view as beneficial.The Company’s inability to meet requirements under its beverage agreements could result in the loss of distribution and manufacturing rights.Under the CBA and the RMA, which authorize the Company to distribute and/or manufacture products of The Coca‑Cola Company, and pursuant to the Company’s distribution agreements with other beverage companies, the Company must satisfy various requirements, such as making minimum capital expenditures or maintaining certain performance rates. Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in the loss of distribution and manufacturing rights for the respective products under one or more of these beverage agreements. The occurrence of other events defined in these agreements could also result in the termination of one or more beverage agreements.The RMA also requires the Company to provide and sell covered beverages to other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers at prices established pursuant to the RMA. As the timing and quantity of such requests by other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers can be unpredictable, any failure by the Company to adequately plan for such demand could also constrain the Company’s supply chain network.Changes in the inputs used to calculate the Company’s acquisition related contingent consideration liability could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s acquisition related contingent consideration liability, which totaled $669.3 million as of December 31, 2023, consists of the estimated amounts due to The Coca‑Cola Company as acquisition related sub-bottling payments under the CBA with The Coca‑Cola Company and CCR over the useful life of the related distribution rights. Changes in business conditions or other events could materially change both the future cash flow projections and the discount rate used in the calculation of the fair value of contingent consideration under the CBA. These changes could result in material changes to the fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration liability and could materially impact the amount of non-cash expense (or income) recorded each reporting period.General Risk Factors
Technology failures or cyberattacks on the Company’s information technology systems or the Company’s effective response to technology failures or cyberattacks on its customers’, suppliers’ or other third parties’ information technology systems could disrupt the Company’s operations and negatively impact the Company’s reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.The Company increasingly relies on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information. Like most companies, the Company’s information technology systems are vulnerable to interruption due to a variety of events beyond the Company’s control, including, but not limited to, power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, other malicious computer programs and cyberattacks, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, usage errors by employees and other security issues. In addition, third-party providers of data hosting or cloud services, as well as other vendors, customers and suppliers, are vulnerable to cybersecurity incidents involving data the Company shares with them. While incidents at our third-party service providers have not materially impacted our business operations, one or more of these incidents could significantly impact the Company in the future.12The Company depends heavily upon the efficient operation of technological resources and a failure in these information technology systems or controls could negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the Company continuously upgrades and updates current technology or installs new technology. In order to address risks to its information technology systems, the Company continues to monitor networks and systems, to upgrade security policies and to train its employees, and it requires third-party service providers and business partners, customers, suppliers and other third parties to do the same. The inability to implement upgrades, updates or installations in a timely manner, to train employees effectively in the use of new or updated technology, or to obtain the anticipated benefits of the Company’s technology could adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or profitability. Additionally, the failure of the Company to successfully migrate key data to new systems could lead to data integrity issues, service interruptions or delays and other increased costs that could adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.The Company has technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate its risk to these vulnerabilities; however, these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to ensure that the Company’s operations are not disrupted. If the Company’s information technology systems, or those of its third-party service providers or business partners, are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, the Company may incur significant financial and other resources to mitigate, upgrade, repair or replace them, and the Company may suffer interruptions in its business operations, resulting in lost revenues and potential delays in reporting its financial results.Further, misuse, leakage or falsification of the Company’s information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations and damage the reputation and credibility of the Company. The Company may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to the Company, current or former employees, bottling partners, other customers, suppliers or consumers, and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight. The Company could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information technology systems, including liability for stolen information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation expense and increased insurance premiums.The Company’s financial condition can be impacted by the stability of the general economy.Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions or in the geographic markets in which the Company does business may have the temporary effect of reducing the demand for certain of the Company’s products. For example, economic forces may cause consumers to shift away from purchasing higher-margin products and packages sold through immediate consumption and other highly profitable channels. Periods of sustained high inflation may have adverse impacts on demand for the Company’s products and on the Company’s ability to sustain margins due to higher input costs. In addition, efforts by the government to curb inflation may cause a general economic slowdown. Adverse economic conditions could also increase the likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which would increase the risk of collectability of certain accounts. Each of these factors could adversely affect the Company’s overall business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s capital structure, including its cash positions and borrowing capacity with banks or other financial institutions and financial markets, exposes it to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of the Company’s counterparties were to become insolvent or enter bankruptcy, the Company’s ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. Consequently, the Company’s access to capital may be diminished. Any such event of default or failure could negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.The concentration risks among the Company’s customers and suppliers could impact our sales and our ability to access necessary product inputs at commercially advantageous prices.The Company faces concentration risks related to a few customers comprising a large portion of the Company’s annual sales volume and net sales. The Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if net sales from one or more of these significant customers is materially reduced or if the cost of complying with the customers’ demands is significant. Additionally, if receivables from one or more of these significant customers become uncollectible, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.The Company’s largest customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and The Kroger Company, accounted for approximately 35% of the Company’s 2023 total bottle/can sales volume to retail customers and approximately 28% of the Company’s 2023 total net sales. These customers typically make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand and customer service performance and generally do not enter into long-term contracts. The Company faces risks related to maintaining the volume 13demanded on a short-term basis from these customers, which can also divert resources away from other customers. The loss of Wal‑Mart Stores, Inc. or The Kroger Company as a customer could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company.Moreover, the Company’s net sales are affected by promotion of the Company’s products by significant customers, such as in-store displays created by customers or the promotion of the Company’s products in customers’ periodic advertising. If the Company’s significant customers change the manner in which they market or promote the Company’s products, or if the marketing efforts by significant customers become ineffective, the Company’s sales volume and net sales could be adversely impacted.Further, the suppliers of certain inputs of the Company’s key products, particularly plastic bottles and aluminum cans, are highly concentrated. This concentration could have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to negotiate the lowest costs and, in light of the Company’s relatively low in-plant raw material inventory levels, has the potential for causing interruptions in the Company’s supply of raw materials and in its manufacture of finished goods.The Company purchases all of the plastic bottles used in its manufacturing plants from Southeastern Container and Western Container, two manufacturing cooperatives the Company co-owns with several other Coca‑Cola bottlers, and all of its aluminum cans from two domestic suppliers. The inability of these suppliers to meet the Company’s requirements for containers could result in the Company not being able to fulfill customer orders and production demand until alternative sources of supply are located. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate. Failure of the plastic bottle or aluminum can suppliers to meet the Company’s purchase requirements could negatively impact inventory levels, customer confidence and results of operations, including sales levels and profitability.The Company may not be able to respond successfully to changes in the marketplace.The Company operates in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverage industry and faces strong competition from other general and specialty beverage companies. The Company’s response to continued and increased customer and competitor consolidations and marketplace competition may result in lower than expected net pricing of the Company’s products. The Company’s ability to gain or maintain the Company’s share of sales or gross margins may be limited by the actions of the Company’s competitors, which may have advantages in setting prices due to lower raw material costs.Competitive pressures in the markets in which the Company operates may cause channel and product mix to shift away from more profitable channels and packages. If the Company is unable to maintain or increase volume in higher-margin products and in packages sold through higher-margin channels, such as immediate consumption, pricing and gross margins could be adversely affected. Any related efforts by the Company to improve pricing and/or gross margin may result in lower than expected sales volume.In addition, the Company’s sales of finished goods to The Coca‑Cola Company and other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers are governed by the RMA, pursuant to which the prices, or certain elements of the formulas used to determine the prices, for such finished goods are unilaterally established by The Coca‑Cola Company from time to time. This limits the Company’s ability to adjust pricing in response to changes in the marketplace, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in the Company’s level of debt, borrowing costs and credit ratings could impact the Company’s access to capital and credit markets, restrict the Company’s operating flexibility and limit the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing to fund future needs.As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $599.2 million of debt outstanding. The Company’s level of debt requires a substantial portion of future cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest, which reduces funds available for other purposes. The Company’s debt level can negatively impact its operations by limiting the Company’s ability to, and/or increasing its cost to, access credit markets for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; increasing the Company’s vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions by limiting the Company’s ability to react to changing economic and business conditions; and exposing the Company to increased risk that the Company will not be able to refinance the principal amount of debt as it becomes due or that a significant decrease in cash flows from operations could make it difficult for the Company to meet its debt service requirements and to comply with financial covenants in its debt agreements.The Company’s acquisition related contingent consideration, revolving credit facility and pension and postretirement medical benefits are subject to changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase in the future, the Company’s borrowing costs could increase, which could negatively impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and limit the Company’s ability to spend in other areas of the business. Further, a decline in the interest rates used to discount the Company’s pension and postretirement medical benefits could increase the cost of these benefits and the amount of the liabilities.14In assessing the Company’s credit strength, credit rating agencies consider the Company’s capital structure, financial policies, consolidated balance sheet and other financial information, and may also consider financial information of other bottling and beverage companies. The Company’s credit ratings could be significantly impacted by the Company’s operating performance, changes in the methodologies used by rating agencies to assess the Company’s credit ratings, changes in The Coca‑Cola Company’s credit ratings and the rating agencies’ perception of the impact of credit market conditions on the Company’s current or future financial performance. Lower credit ratings could significantly increase the Company’s borrowing costs or adversely affect the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing at acceptable interest rates or to refinance existing debt.Failure to attract, train and retain qualified employees while controlling labor costs, and other labor issues could have an adverse effect on the Company’s reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations or profitability.The Company’s future growth and performance depend on its ability to attract, hire, train, develop, motivate and retain a highly skilled, diverse and properly credentialed workforce, including front-line employees. The Company’s ability to meet its labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to many external factors, including competition for and availability of qualified personnel in a given market, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage laws, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment and labor laws or other workplace regulations. The Company’s labor costs could be impacted by new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws that are adopted or implemented. Any unplanned turnover or unsuccessful implementation of the Company’s succession plans could deplete the Company’s institutional knowledge base and erode its competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect the Company’s reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.The Company uses various insurance structures to manage costs related to workers’ compensation, auto liability, medical and other insurable risks. These structures consist of retentions, deductibles, limits and a diverse group of insurers that serve to strategically finance, transfer and mitigate the financial impact of losses to the Company. Losses are accrued using assumptions and procedures followed in the insurance industry, then adjusted for company-specific history and expectations. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations.In addition, the Company’s profitability is substantially affected by the cost of pension retirement benefits, postretirement medical benefits and current employees’ medical benefits. Macroeconomic factors beyond the Company’s control, including increases in healthcare costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities, could result in significant increases in these costs for the Company. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations.Failure to maintain productive relationships with our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, including failing to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Approximately 15% of the Company’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Any inability of the Company to renegotiate subsequent agreements with labor unions on satisfactory terms and conditions could result in work interruptions or stoppages, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s profitability. In addition, the terms and conditions of existing or renegotiated agreements could increase costs or otherwise affect the Company’s ability to fully implement operational changes to improve overall efficiency.Certain employees of the Company whose employment is covered under collective bargaining agreements participate in a multiemployer pension plan, the Employers-Teamsters Local Union Nos. 175 and 505 Pension Fund (the “Teamsters Plan”). Participating in the Teamsters Plan involves certain risks in addition to the risks associated with single employer pension plans, as contributed assets are pooled and may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer stops contributing to the Teamsters Plan, the unfunded obligations of the Teamsters Plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If the Company chooses to stop participating in the Teamsters Plan, the Company could be required to pay the Teamsters Plan a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the Teamsters Plan.Changes in tax laws, disagreements with tax authorities or additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The Company is subject to income taxes within the United States. The Company’s annual income tax rate is based upon the Company’s income, federal tax laws and various state and local tax laws within the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. 15Changes in federal, state or local income tax rates and/or tax laws could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial results.Excise or other taxes imposed on the sale of certain of the Company’s products by the federal government and certain state and local governments, particularly any taxes incorporated into shelf prices and passed along to consumers, could cause consumers to shift away from purchasing products of the Company, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business and financial results.In addition, an assessment of additional taxes resulting from audits of the Company’s tax filings could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability, cash flows and financial condition.Litigation or legal proceedings could expose the Company to significant liabilities and damage the Company’s reputation.The Company is from time to time a party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, litigation claims and legal proceedings arising out of its advertising and marketing practices, product claims and labels, intellectual property and commercial disputes, and environmental and employment matters. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, the Company records reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Although the Company does not believe a material amount of loss in excess of recorded amounts is reasonably possible as a result of these claims, the Company faces risk of an adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows, depending on the outcome of the legal proceedings.Natural disasters, changing weather patterns and unfavorable weather could negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition and future results of operations or profitability.Natural disasters or unfavorable weather conditions in the geographic regions in which the Company or its suppliers operate could have an adverse impact on the Company’s revenue and profitability. For instance, unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for the Company’s products and contribute to lower sales, which could adversely affect the Company’s profitability for such periods. Prolonged drought conditions could lead to restrictions on water use, which could adversely affect the Company’s cost and ability to manufacture and distribute products. Hurricanes or similar storms may have a negative sourcing impact or cause shifts in product mix to lower-margin products and packages.Climate change may have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could cause significant changes in weather patterns and an increase in the frequency or duration of extreme weather and climate events. These changes could adversely impact some of the Company’s facilities, the availability and cost of key raw materials used by the Company in production or the demand for the Company’s products. Public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require the Company to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. In addition, federal, state or local governmental authorities may propose legislative and regulatory initiatives in response to concerns over climate change, which could directly or indirectly adversely affect the Company’s business, require additional investments or increase the cost of raw materials, fuel, ingredients and water. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on the Company’s business and results of operations"
10,COKE,COCA-COLA BTLNG CONS,2023-02-22,"Risk Factors
.In addition to other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company’s business. The Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.Risks Related to Our BusinessThe Company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or unavailability or shortages of raw materials, fuel and other supplies.Raw material costs, including the costs for plastic bottles, aluminum cans, PET resin, carbon dioxide and high fructose corn syrup, are subject to significant price volatility, which may be worsened by periods of increased demand, supply constraints or high inflation. International or domestic geopolitical or other events, including armed conflict or the imposition of tariffs and/or quotas by the U.S. government on any of these raw materials, could adversely impact the supply and cost of these raw materials to the Company. In 8recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in certain raw materials not being available at commercially favorable terms or at all, and future pandemics or other events causing widespread supply chain disruption may also have such an effect. In addition, there are no limits on the prices The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies can charge for concentrate. If the Company cannot offset higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, effective commodity price hedging, increased sales volume or reductions in other costs, the Company’s results of operations and profitability could be adversely affected.Limited suppliers for certain of the Company’s raw materials could have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to negotiate the lowest costs and, in light of the Company’s relatively low in-plant raw material inventory levels, has the potential for causing interruptions in the Company’s supply of raw materials and in its manufacture of finished goods. For example, during 2022, the Company experienced intermittent shortages of carbon dioxide supply that caused work stoppages at certain of its manufacturing facilities. These work stoppages were offset by increased production at other facilities, but similar stoppages in the future could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and profitability. The Company uses significant amounts of fuel for its delivery fleet and other vehicles used in the distribution of its products. International or domestic geopolitical or other events could impact the supply and cost of fuel and the timely delivery of the Company’s products to its customers. Although the Company strives to reduce fuel consumption and uses commodity hedges to manage the Company’s fuel costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting the impact of fuel price increases or price volatility on the Company’s business or future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations.The Company uses a combination of internal and external freight shipping and transportation services to transport and deliver products. The Company’s freight cost and the timely delivery of its products may be adversely impacted by a number of factors which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations, including driver shortages, reduced availability of independent contractor drivers, higher fuel costs, weather conditions, traffic congestion, increased government regulation and other matters.The Company purchases all of the plastic bottles used in its manufacturing plants from Southeastern Container and Western Container, two manufacturing cooperatives the Company co-owns with several other Coca‑Cola bottlers, and all of its aluminum cans from two domestic suppliers. The inability of these suppliers to meet the Company’s requirements for containers could result in the Company not being able to fulfill customer orders and production demand until alternative sources of supply are located. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate. Failure of the plastic bottle or aluminum can suppliers to meet the Company’s purchase requirements could negatively impact inventory levels, customer confidence and results of operations, including sales levels and profitability.The Company continues to make significant reinvestments in its business in order to evolve its operating model and to accommodate future growth and portfolio expansion, including supply chain optimization. The increased costs associated with these reinvestments, the potential for disruption in manufacturing and distribution and the risk the Company may not realize a satisfactory return on its investments could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.The reliance on purchased finished products from external sources could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability.The Company does not, and does not plan to, manufacture all of the products it distributes and, therefore, remains reliant on purchased finished products from external sources to meet customer demand. As a result, the Company is subject to incremental risk, including, but not limited to, product quality and availability, price variability and production capacity shortfalls for externally purchased finished products, which could have an impact on the Company’s profitability and customer relationships. Particularly, the Company is subject to the risk of unavailability of still products that it acquires from other manufacturers, leading to an inability to meet consumer demand for these products. In most instances, the Company’s ability to negotiate the prices at which it purchases finished products from other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers is limited pursuant to The Coca‑Cola Company’s right to unilaterally establish the prices, or certain elements of the formulas used to determine the prices, for such finished products under the RMA, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability.Changes in public and consumer perception and preferences, including concerns related to product safety and sustainability, artificial ingredients, brand reputation and obesity, could reduce demand for the Company’s products and reduce profitability.Concerns about perceived negative safety and quality consequences of certain ingredients in the Company’s products, such as non-nutritive sweeteners or ingredients in energy drinks, may erode consumers’ confidence in the safety and quality of the Company’s products, whether or not justified. The Company’s business is also impacted by changes in consumer concerns or perceptions surrounding the product manufacturing processes and packaging materials, including single-use and other plastic packaging, and the environmental and sustainability impact of such manufacturing processes and packaging materials. Any of these factors may reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase the Company’s products and any inability on the part of the Company to anticipate or react to such 9changes could result in reduced demand for the Company’s products or erode the Company’s competitive and financial position and could adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.The Company’s success depends on its ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of its products. The Company has rigorous product safety and quality standards. However, if beverage products taken to market are or become contaminated or adulterated, the Company may be required to conduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which could cause its business and reputation to suffer.The Company’s success also depends in large part on its ability and the ability of The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies it works with to maintain the brand image of existing products, build up brand image for new products and brand extensions and maintain its corporate reputation and social license to operate. Engagements by the Company’s executives in social and public policy debates may occasionally be the subject of criticism from advocacy groups that have differing points of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. Similarly, the Company’s sponsorship relationships and charitable giving program could subject the Company to negative publicity as a result of actual or perceived views of organizations the Company sponsors or supports financially. Likewise, negative postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company, The Coca‑Cola Company or one of the products the Company carries, even if inaccurate or malicious, could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of the Company’s brands or the Company.The Company’s business depends substantially on consumer tastes, preferences and shopping habits that change in often unpredictable ways. As a result of certain health and wellness trends, including concern over the public health consequences associated with obesity, consumer preferences over the past several years have shifted from sugar-sweetened sparkling beverages to diet sparkling beverages, tea, sports drinks, enhanced water and bottled water. As the Company distributes, markets and manufactures beverage brands owned by others, the success of the Company’s business depends in large measure on the ability of The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies to develop and introduce product innovations to meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market, and failure to satisfy these consumer preferences could adversely affect the Company’s profitability.The Company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the inability to attract and retain front-line employees in a tight labor market. In recent years, the U.S. economy has experienced a challenging labor market as the supply of available workers frequently fell short of the number of workers necessary to fill all available jobs. As a result, the Company experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining front-line workers and faced periods of high turnover. Tight labor markets and a lack of available workers has led, and may lead in the future, to increased labor costs in the form of higher salaries, increased overtime and other compensation adjustments to remain competitive in a challenging labor market. If the Company cannot retain adequate front-line employees to produce and deliver its products, its business operations may be adversely affected and higher labor costs have had, and may have in the future, an adverse effect on our results of operations.Changes in government regulations related to nonalcoholic beverages, including regulations related to obesity, public health, artificial ingredients and product safety and sustainability, could reduce demand for the Company’s products and reduce profitability.The Company’s business and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those governing the production, packaging, quality, labeling and distribution of beverage products. Compliance with or changes in existing laws or regulations could require material expenses and negatively affect our financial results through lower sales or higher costs.The production and marketing of beverages are subject to the rules and regulations of the FDA and other federal, state and local health agencies, and extensive changes in these rules and regulations could increase the Company’s costs or adversely impact its sales. The Company cannot predict whether any such rules or regulations will be enacted or, if enacted, the impact that such rules or regulations could have on its business.In response to growing health, nutrition and wellness concerns for today’s youth, a number of states and local governments have regulations restricting the sale of soft drinks and other foods in schools, particularly elementary, middle and high schools. Many of these restrictions have existed for several years in connection with subsidized meal programs in schools. Additionally, legislation has been proposed by certain state and local governments to limit or restrict the sale of energy drinks to minors and/or persons below a specified age and/or to restrict the venues in which energy drinks can be sold. Restrictive legislation, if widely enacted, could have an adverse impact on the Company’s products, sales and reputation.Legislation has been proposed in Congress and by certain state and local governments which would prohibit the sale of soft drink products in non-refillable bottles and cans or require a mandatory deposit as a means of encouraging the return of such containers, each in an attempt to reduce solid waste and litter. Similarly, the Company is aware of proposed legislation that would impose fees or 10taxes on various types of containers used in its business, as well as proposed legislation around new recycling regulations and the reduction of single-use plastics. The Company is not currently impacted by the policies in these types of proposed legislation, but it is possible that similar or more restrictive legal requirements may be proposed or enacted within its distribution territories in the future.Concerns about perceived negative safety and quality consequences of certain ingredients in the Company’s products, such as non-nutritive sweeteners or ingredients in energy drinks, could result in additional governmental regulations concerning the production, marketing, labeling or availability of the Company’s products or the ingredients in such products, possible new taxes or negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against the Company or other companies in the same industry, any of which could damage the reputation of the Company or reduce demand for the Company’s products, which could adversely affect the Company’s profitability.The FDA occasionally proposes major changes to the nutrition labels required on all packaged foods and beverages, including those for most of the Company’s products, which could require the Company and its competitors to revise nutrition labels to include updated serving sizes, information about total calories in a beverage product container and information about any added sugars or nutrients. Any pervasive nutrition label changes could increase the Company’s costs and could inhibit sales of one or more of the Company’s major products.Most beverage products sold by the Company are classified as food or food products and are therefore eligible for purchase using SNAP benefits by consumers purchasing them for home consumption. Energy drinks with a nutrition facts label are also classified as food and are eligible for purchase for home consumption using SNAP benefits, whereas energy drinks classified as a supplement by the FDA are not. Regulators may restrict the use of benefit programs, including SNAP, to purchase certain beverages and foods currently classified as food or food products.The Company relies on The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies to invest in the Company through marketing funding and to promote their own company brand identity through external advertising, marketing spending and product innovation. Decreases from historic levels of investment could negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations or profitability.The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies have historically provided financial support to the Company through marketing funding. While the Company does not believe there will be significant changes to the amount of marketing funding support provided by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies, the Company’s beverage agreements generally do not obligate such funding and there can be no assurance the historic levels will continue. Decreases in the level of marketing funding provided, material changes in the marketing funding programs’ performance requirements or the Company’s inability to meet the performance requirements for marketing funding could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations or profitability.In addition, The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies have their own external advertising campaigns, marketing spending and product innovation programs, which directly impact the Company’s operations. Decreases in advertising, marketing and product innovation spending by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies, or advertising campaigns that are negatively perceived by the public, could adversely impact the sales volume growth and profitability of the Company. While the Company does not believe there will be significant changes in the level of external advertising and marketing spending by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies, there can be no assurance the historic levels will continue or that advertising campaigns will be positively perceived by the public. The Company’s volume growth is also dependent on product innovation by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies, and their ability to develop and introduce products that meet consumer preferences.The Company is a participant in several Coca‑Cola system governance entities, and decisions made by these governance entities may be different than decisions that would have been made by the Company individually. Any failure of these governance entities to function efficiently or on the best behalf of the Company and any failure or delay of the Company to receive anticipated benefits from these governance entities could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company is a member of CONA and party to an amended and restated master services agreement with CONA, pursuant to which the Company is an authorized user of the CONA System, a uniform information technology system developed to promote operational efficiency and uniformity among North American Coca‑Cola bottlers. The Company relies on CONA to make necessary upgrades to and resolve ongoing or disaster-related technology issues with the CONA System, and it is limited in its authority and ability to timely resolve errors or to make changes to the CONA software. Any service interruptions of the CONA System could result in increased costs or adversely impact the Company’s results of operations. In addition, because other Coca‑Cola bottlers are also users of the CONA System and would likely experience similar service interruptions, the Company may not be able to have another bottler process orders on its behalf during any such interruption.11The Company is also a member of the NPSG, which is comprised of The Coca‑Cola Company, the Company and certain other Coca‑Cola bottlers who are regional producing bottlers in The Coca‑Cola Company’s national product supply system. Subject to the terms and conditions of the NPSG Agreement, the Company is required to comply with certain key decisions made by the NPSG Board, which include decisions regarding strategic infrastructure investment and divestment planning, optimal national product supply sourcing and new product or packaging infrastructure planning. Although the Company has a representative on the NPSG Board, the Company cannot exercise sole decision-making authority relating to the decisions of the NPSG Board, and the interests of other members of the NPSG Board may diverge from those of the Company. Any such divergence could have a material adverse effect on the operating and financial results of the Company.Provisions in the CBA and the RMA with The Coca‑Cola Company could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or a sale of the Company’s Coca‑Cola distribution or manufacturing businesses.Provisions in the CBA and the RMA require the Company to obtain The Coca‑Cola Company’s prior approval of a potential buyer of the Company’s Coca‑Cola distribution or manufacturing businesses, which could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or the Company’s ability to sell such businesses. The Company can obtain a list of pre-approved third-party buyers from The Coca‑Cola Company annually. In addition, the Company can seek buyer-specific approval from The Coca‑Cola Company upon receipt of a third-party offer to purchase the Company or its Coca‑Cola distribution or manufacturing businesses. If a change in control or sale of one of our businesses is delayed or prevented by the provisions in the CBA and the RMA, the market price of our Common Stock could be negatively affected.The concentration of the Company’s capital stock ownership with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer limits other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters.As of December 31, 2022, J. Frank Harrison, III, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, controlled 1,004,394 shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock, which represented approximately 71% of the total voting power of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on a consolidated basis. Mr. Harrison also has the right to acquire 292,386 shares of Class B Common Stock from the Company in exchange for an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock. In the event of such an exchange, Mr. Harrison would control 1,296,780 shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock, which would represent approximately 76% of the total voting power of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on a consolidated basis. Furthermore, Mr. Harrison and another member of the Harrison family serve on the Company’s Board of Directors.As a result, Mr. Harrison has the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over the Company’s management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by the Company’s stockholders, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of the Company or its assets. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control otherwise favored by the Company’s other stockholders and could depress the stock price or limit other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters, which could result in the Company making decisions that stockholders outside the Harrison family may not view as beneficial.The Company’s inability to meet requirements under its beverage agreements could result in the loss of distribution and manufacturing rights.Under the CBA and the RMA, which authorize the Company to distribute and/or manufacture products of The Coca‑Cola Company, and pursuant to the Company’s distribution agreements with other beverage companies, the Company must satisfy various requirements, such as making minimum capital expenditures or maintaining certain performance rates. Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in the loss of distribution and manufacturing rights for the respective products under one or more of these beverage agreements. The occurrence of other events defined in these agreements could also result in the termination of one or more beverage agreements.The RMA also requires the Company to provide and sell covered beverages to other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers at prices established pursuant to the RMA. As the timing and quantity of such requests by other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers can be unpredictable, any failure by the Company to adequately plan for such demand could also constrain the Company’s supply chain network.Changes in the inputs used to calculate the Company’s acquisition related contingent consideration liability could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s acquisition related contingent consideration liability, which totaled $541.5 million as of December 31, 2022, consists of the estimated amounts due to The Coca‑Cola Company as acquisition related sub-bottling payments under the CBA with The Coca‑Cola Company and CCR over the useful life of the related distribution rights. Changes in business conditions or other events could materially change both the future cash flow projections and the discount rate used in the calculation of the fair value of 12contingent consideration under the CBA. These changes could result in material changes to the fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration and could materially impact the amount of non-cash expense (or income) recorded each reporting period.General Risk Factors
Technology failures or cyberattacks on the Company’s technology systems or the Company’s effective response to technology failures or cyberattacks on its customers’, suppliers’ or other third parties’ technology systems could disrupt the Company’s operations and negatively impact the Company’s reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.The Company increasingly relies on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information. Like most companies, the Company’s information technology systems are vulnerable to interruption due to a variety of events beyond the Company’s control, including, but not limited to, power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, other malicious computer programs and cyberattacks, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, usage errors by employees and other security issues. In addition, third-party providers of data hosting or cloud services, as well as other vendors, customers and suppliers, are vulnerable to cybersecurity incidents involving data the Company shares with them. While incidents at our third-party service providers have not materially impacted our business operations, one or more of these incidents could significantly impact the Company in the future.The Company depends heavily upon the efficient operation of technological resources and a failure in these technology systems or controls could negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the Company continuously upgrades and updates current technology or installs new technology. In order to address risks to its technology systems, the Company continues to monitor networks and systems, upgrade security policies and train its employees, and it requires third-party service providers and business partners, customers, suppliers and other third parties to do the same. The inability to implement upgrades, updates or installations in a timely manner, to train employees effectively in the use of new or updated technology, or to obtain the anticipated benefits of the Company’s technology could adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or profitability.The Company has technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate its risk to these vulnerabilities; however, these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to ensure that the Company’s operations are not disrupted. If the Company’s technology systems, or those of its third-party service providers or business partners, are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, the Company may incur significant financial and other resources to mitigate, upgrade, repair or replace them, and the Company may suffer interruptions in its business operations, resulting in lost revenues and potential delays in reporting its financial results.Further, misuse, leakage or falsification of the Company’s information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations and damage the reputation and credibility of the Company. The Company may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to the Company, current or former employees, bottling partners, other customers, suppliers or consumers, and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight. The Company could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information technology systems, including liability for stolen information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation expense and increased insurance premiums.The Company’s financial condition can be impacted by the stability of the general economy.Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions or in the geographic markets in which the Company does business may have the temporary effect of reducing the demand for certain of the Company’s products. For example, economic forces may cause consumers to shift away from purchasing higher-margin products and packages sold through immediate consumption and other highly profitable channels. Periods of sustained high inflation may have adverse impacts on demand for the Company’s products and on the Company’s ability to sustain margins due to higher input costs. In addition, efforts by the government to curb inflation may cause a general economic slowdown. Adverse economic conditions could also increase the likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which would increase the risk of uncollectability of certain accounts. Each of these factors could adversely affect the Company’s overall business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s capital structure, including its cash positions and borrowing capacity with banks or other financial institutions and financial markets, exposes it to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of the Company’s counterparties were to become insolvent or enter bankruptcy, the Company’s ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. Consequently, the Company’s access to capital may be 13diminished. Any such event of default or failure could negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in the Company’s top customer relationships and marketing strategies could impact sales volume and net sales.The Company faces concentration risks related to a few customers comprising a large portion of the Company’s annual sales volume and net sales. The Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if net sales from one or more of these significant customers is materially reduced or if the cost of complying with the customers’ demands is significant. Additionally, if receivables from one or more of these significant customers become uncollectible, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.The Company’s largest customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and The Kroger Company, accounted for approximately 32% of the Company’s 2022 total bottle/can sales volume to retail customers and approximately 26% of the Company’s 2022 total net sales. These customers typically make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand and customer service performance and generally do not enter into long-term contracts. The Company faces risks related to maintaining the volume demanded on a short-term basis from these customers, which can also divert resources away from other customers. The loss of Wal‑Mart Stores, Inc. or The Kroger Company as a customer could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company.Further, the Company’s net sales are affected by promotion of the Company’s products by significant customers, such as in-store displays created by customers or the promotion of the Company’s products in customers’ periodic advertising. If the Company’s significant customers change the manner in which they market or promote the Company’s products, or if the marketing efforts by significant customers become ineffective, the Company’s sales volume and net sales could be adversely impacted.The Company may not be able to respond successfully to changes in the marketplace.The Company operates in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverage industry and faces strong competition from other general and specialty beverage companies. The Company’s response to continued and increased customer and competitor consolidations and marketplace competition may result in lower than expected net pricing of the Company’s products. The Company’s ability to gain or maintain the Company’s share of sales or gross margins may be limited by the actions of the Company’s competitors, which may have advantages in setting prices due to lower raw material costs.Competitive pressures in the markets in which the Company operates may cause channel and product mix to shift away from more profitable channels and packages. If the Company is unable to maintain or increase volume in higher-margin products and in packages sold through higher-margin channels, such as immediate consumption, pricing and gross margins could be adversely affected. Any related efforts by the Company to improve pricing and/or gross margin may result in lower than expected sales volume.In addition, the Company’s sales of finished goods to The Coca‑Cola Company and other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers are governed by the RMA, pursuant to which the prices, or certain elements of the formulas used to determine the prices, for such finished goods are unilaterally established by The Coca‑Cola Company from time to time. This limits the Company’s ability to adjust pricing in response to changes in the marketplace, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in the Company’s level of debt, borrowing costs and credit ratings could impact access to capital and credit markets, restrict the Company’s operating flexibility and limit the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing to fund future needs.As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $598.8 million of debt outstanding. The Company’s level of debt requires a substantial portion of future cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest, which reduces funds available for other purposes. The Company’s debt level can negatively impact its operations by limiting the Company’s ability to, and/or increasing its cost to, access credit markets for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; increasing the Company’s vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions by limiting the Company’s ability to react to changing economic and business conditions; and exposing the Company to increased risk that the Company will not be able to refinance the principal amount of debt as it becomes due or that a significant decrease in cash flows from operations could make it difficult for the Company to meet its debt service requirements and to comply with financial covenants in its debt agreements.The Company’s acquisition related contingent consideration, revolving credit facility and pension and postretirement medical benefits are subject to changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase in the future, the Company’s borrowing costs could increase, which could negatively impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and limit the Company’s ability to spend in other areas of the business. Further, a decline in the interest rates used to discount the Company’s pension and postretirement medical liabilities could increase the cost of these benefits and the amount of the liabilities.14In assessing the Company’s credit strength, credit rating agencies consider the Company’s capital structure, financial policies, consolidated balance sheet and other financial information, and may also consider financial information of other bottling and beverage companies. The Company’s credit ratings could be significantly impacted by the Company’s operating performance, changes in the methodologies used by rating agencies to assess the Company’s credit ratings, changes in The Coca‑Cola Company’s credit ratings and the rating agencies’ perception of the impact of credit market conditions on the Company’s current or future financial performance. Lower credit ratings could significantly increase the Company’s borrowing costs or adversely affect the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing at acceptable interest rates or to refinance existing debt.Failure to attract, train and retain qualified employees while controlling labor costs, and other labor issues could have an adverse effect on the Company’s reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations or profitability.The Company’s future growth and performance depend on its ability to attract, hire, train, develop, motivate and retain a highly skilled, diverse and properly credentialed workforce. The Company’s ability to meet its labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to many external factors, including competition for and availability of qualified personnel in a given market, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage laws, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment and labor laws or other workplace regulations. The Company’s labor costs could be impacted by new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws that are adopted or implemented. Any unplanned turnover or unsuccessful implementation of the Company’s succession plans could deplete the Company’s institutional knowledge base and erode its competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect the Company’s reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.The Company uses various insurance structures to manage costs related to workers’ compensation, auto liability, medical and other insurable risks. These structures consist of retentions, deductibles, limits and a diverse group of insurers that serve to strategically finance, transfer and mitigate the financial impact of losses to the Company. Losses are accrued using assumptions and procedures followed in the insurance industry, then adjusted for company-specific history and expectations. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations.In addition, the Company’s profitability is substantially affected by the cost of pension retirement benefits, postretirement medical benefits and current employees’ medical benefits. Macro-economic factors beyond the Company’s control, including increases in healthcare costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities, could result in significant increases in these costs for the Company. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations.Failure to maintain productive relationships with our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, including failing to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Approximately 13% of the Company’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Any inability of the Company to renegotiate subsequent agreements with labor unions on satisfactory terms and conditions could result in work interruptions or stoppages, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s profitability. In addition, the terms and conditions of existing or renegotiated agreements could increase costs or otherwise affect the Company’s ability to fully implement operational changes to improve overall efficiency.Certain employees of the Company whose employment is covered under collective bargaining agreements participate in a multiemployer pension plan, the Employers-Teamsters Local Union Nos. 175 and 505 Pension Fund (the “Teamsters Plan”). Participating in the Teamsters Plan involves certain risks in addition to the risks associated with single employer pension plans, as contributed assets are pooled and may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer stops contributing to the Teamsters Plan, the unfunded obligations of the Teamsters Plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If the Company chooses to stop participating in the Teamsters Plan, the Company could be required to pay the Teamsters Plan a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the Teamsters Plan.Changes in tax laws, disagreements with tax authorities or additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The Company is subject to income taxes within the United States. The Company’s annual income tax rate is based upon the Company’s income, federal tax laws and various state and local tax laws within the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. 15Changes in federal, state or local income tax rates and/or tax laws could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial results.Excise or other taxes imposed on the sale of certain of the Company’s products by the federal government and certain state and local governments, particularly any taxes incorporated into shelf prices and passed along to consumers, could cause consumers to shift away from purchasing products of the Company, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business and financial results.In addition, an assessment of additional taxes resulting from audits of the Company’s tax filings could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability, cash flows and financial condition.Litigation or legal proceedings could expose the Company to significant liabilities and damage the Company’s reputation.The Company is from time to time a party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, litigation claims and legal proceedings arising out of its advertising and marketing practices, product claims and labels, intellectual property and commercial disputes, and environmental and employment matters. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, the Company records reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Although the Company does not believe a material amount of loss in excess of recorded amounts is reasonably possible as a result of these claims, the Company faces risk of an adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows, depending on the outcome of the legal proceedings.Natural disasters, changing weather patterns and unfavorable weather could negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition and future results of operations or profitability.Natural disasters or unfavorable weather conditions in the geographic regions in which the Company or its suppliers operate could have an adverse impact on the Company’s revenue and profitability. For instance, unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for the Company’s products and contribute to lower sales, which could adversely affect the Company’s profitability for such periods. Prolonged drought conditions could lead to restrictions on water use, which could adversely affect the Company’s cost and ability to manufacture and distribute products. Hurricanes or similar storms may have a negative sourcing impact or cause shifts in product mix to lower-margin products and packages.Climate change may have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could cause significant changes in weather patterns and an increase in the frequency or duration of extreme weather and climate events. These changes could adversely impact some of the Company’s facilities, the availability and cost of key raw materials used by the Company in production or the demand for the Company’s products. Public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require the Company to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. In addition, federal, state or local governmental authorities may propose legislative and regulatory initiatives in response to concerns over climate change which could directly or indirectly adversely affect the Company’s business, require additional investments or increase the cost of raw materials, fuel, ingredients and water. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on the Company’s business and results of operations"
13,COKE,COCA-COLA BTLNG CONS,2022-02-22,"Risk Factors
.In addition to other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company’s business. The Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.Risks Related to Our BusinessThe Company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or unavailability or shortages of raw materials, fuel and other supplies.Raw material costs, including the costs for plastic bottles, aluminum cans, PET resin, carbon dioxide and high fructose corn syrup, are subject to significant price volatility, which may be worsened by periods of increased demand, supply constraints or high inflation. International or domestic geopolitical or other events, including the imposition of tariffs and/or quotas by the U.S. government on any of these raw materials, could adversely impact the supply and cost of these raw materials to the Company. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in certain raw materials not being available at commercially favorable terms or at all, and other similar pandemics may have such an effect in the future. In addition, there are no limits on the prices The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies can charge for concentrate. If the Company cannot offset higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, effective commodity price hedging, increased sales volume or reductions in other costs, the Company’s results of operations and profitability could be adversely affected.Limited suppliers for certain of the Company’s raw materials could have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to negotiate the lowest costs and, in light of the Company’s relatively low in-plant raw material inventory levels, has the potential for causing interruptions in the Company’s supply of raw materials and in its manufacture of finished goods.The Company uses significant amounts of fuel for its delivery fleet and other vehicles used in the distribution of its products. International or domestic geopolitical or other events could impact the supply and cost of fuel and the timely delivery of the Company’s products to its customers. Although the Company strives to reduce fuel consumption and uses commodity hedges to manage the Company’s fuel costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting the impact of fuel price increases or price volatility on the Company’s business or future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations.The Company uses a combination of internal and external freight shipping and transportation services to transport and deliver products. The Company’s freight cost and the timely delivery of its products may be adversely impacted by a number of factors which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations, including driver shortages, reduced availability of independent contractor drivers, higher fuel costs, weather conditions, traffic congestion, increased government regulation and other matters.The Company purchases all of the plastic bottles used in its manufacturing plants from Southeastern Container and Western Container, two manufacturing cooperatives the Company co-owns with several other Coca‑Cola bottlers, and a majority of its aluminum cans from two domestic suppliers. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant tightening in the domestic market for aluminum cans due to changing consumer purchasing patterns and, as a result, the Company changed its typical sourcing model and began to source aluminum cans from international locations. The inability of these plastic bottle or aluminum can suppliers to meet the Company’s requirements for containers could result in the Company not being able to fulfill customer orders and production demand until alternative sources of supply are located. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate. Failure of the plastic bottle or aluminum can suppliers to meet the Company’s purchase requirements could negatively impact inventory levels, customer confidence and results of operations, including sales levels and profitability.The Company continues to make significant reinvestments in its business in order to evolve its operating model and to accommodate future growth and portfolio expansion, including supply chain optimization. The increased costs associated with these reinvestments, the potential for disruption in manufacturing and distribution and the risk the Company may not realize a satisfactory return on its investments could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.The Company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the inability to attract and retain front-line employees in a tight labor market. In 2021, the U.S. economy experienced unusually tight labor market conditions as the supply of available workers frequently fell short of the number of workers necessary to fill all available jobs. As a result, the Company experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining front-line workers and significant turnover. Tight labor markets and a lack of available workers has led, and may lead in the future, to increased labor costs in the form of higher salaries and increased overtime. If the Company cannot retain adequate front-line 9employees to produce and deliver its products, its business operations may be adversely affected and higher labor costs have had, and may have in the future, an adverse effect on our results of operations.   Moreover, the supply of front-line workers, and the Company’s ability to retain such workers, may be adversely impacted by future COVID-19 regulations and policies. The Company is actively monitoring the status of announced and potential regulations concerning vaccination or periodic testing for COVID-19 and the impact that such regulations, if implemented, may have on its workforce. If a significant number of our teammates are negatively impacted by regulations requiring vaccination or periodic testing of unvaccinated teammates, it may result in teammate attrition and our business operations may be adversely affected. The reliance on purchased finished products from external sources could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability.The Company does not, and does not plan to, manufacture all products it distributes and, therefore, remains reliant on purchased finished products from external sources to meet customer demand. As a result, the Company is subject to incremental risk, including, but not limited to, product quality and availability, price variability and production capacity shortfalls for externally purchased finished products, which could have an impact on the Company’s profitability and customer relationships. Particularly, the Company is subject to the risk of unavailability of still products that it acquires from other manufacturers, leading to an inability to meet consumer demand for these products. In most instances, the Company’s ability to negotiate the prices at which it purchases finished products from other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers is limited pursuant to The Coca‑Cola Company’s right to unilaterally establish the prices, or certain elements of the formulas used to determine the prices, for such finished products under the RMA, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability.Changes in public and consumer perception and preferences, including concerns related to product safety and sustainability, artificial ingredients, brand reputation and obesity, could reduce demand for the Company’s products and reduce profitability.Concerns about perceived negative safety and quality consequences of certain ingredients in the Company’s products, such as non-nutritive sweeteners or ingredients in energy drinks, may erode consumers’ confidence in the safety and quality of the Company’s products, whether or not justified. The Company’s business is also impacted by changes in consumer concerns or perceptions surrounding the product manufacturing processes and packaging materials, including single-use and other plastic packaging, and the environmental and sustainability impact of such manufacturing processes and packaging materials. Any of these factors may reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase the Company’s products and any inability on the part of the Company to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for the Company’s products or erode the Company’s competitive and financial position and could adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.The Company’s success depends on its ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of its products. The Company has rigorous product safety and quality standards. However, if beverage products taken to market are or become contaminated or adulterated, the Company may be required to conduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which could cause its business and reputation to suffer.The Company’s success also depends in large part on its ability and the ability of The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies it works with to maintain the brand image of existing products, build up brand image for new products and brand extensions and maintain its corporate reputation and social license to operate. Engagements by the Company’s executives in social and public policy debates may occasionally be the subject of criticism from advocacy groups that have differing points of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. Similarly, the Company’s sponsorship relationships and charitable giving program could subject the Company to negative publicity as a result of actual or perceived views of organizations the Company sponsors or supports financially. Likewise, negative postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company, The Coca‑Cola Company or one of the products the Company carries, even if inaccurate or malicious, could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of the Company’s brands or the Company.The Company’s business depends substantially on consumer tastes, preferences and shopping habits that change in often unpredictable ways. As a result of certain health and wellness trends, including concern over the public health consequences associated with obesity, consumer preferences over the past several years have shifted from sugar-sweetened sparkling beverages to diet sparkling beverages, tea, sports drinks, enhanced water and bottled water. As the Company distributes, markets and manufactures beverage brands owned by others, the success of the Company’s business depends in large measure on the ability of The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies to develop and introduce product innovations to meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market, and failure to satisfy these consumer preferences could adversely affect the Company’s profitability.10The COVID-19 pandemic and other pandemic outbreaks in the future could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our business. Future pandemics may also pose risks similar to, or more severe than, the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and such risks are impossible to predict with certainty at this time. Any of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those described below, alone or in combination with others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.•The closing or restricted operations of many public locations, which caused a decrease in sales volume in on-premise locations during 2020 and parts of 2021.•Consumer demand may shift from higher margin products sold for immediate consumption through smaller retail stores and on-premise locations to lower margin, take-home products sold in grocery stores, mass merchandise stores and club stores, as experienced during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.•Disruptions in our concentrate suppliers’ production and distribution operations could increase concentrate costs and create delays in delivery of concentrate, which could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and distribute certain products. Further, disruptions in supply chains have placed, and may continue to place, constraints on our ability to procure beverage containers, such as plastic bottles and aluminum cans. These supply chain disruptions have increased, and in the future could increase further, our packaging costs and alter the product offerings to our customers.•Actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, because of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in legal claims or litigation against us.•The resumption of normal business operations may be delayed or constrained by the persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic, including variants of the disease, and lingering effects on our consumers, customers, suppliers and/or third-party service providers and business partners.Changes in government regulations related to nonalcoholic beverages, including regulations related to obesity, public health, artificial ingredients and product safety and sustainability, could reduce demand for the Company’s products and reduce profitability.The Company’s business and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those governing the production, packaging, quality, labeling and distribution of beverage products. Compliance with or changes in existing laws or regulations could require material expenses and negatively affect our financial results through lower sales or higher costs.The production and marketing of beverages are subject to the rules and regulations of the FDA and other federal, state and local health agencies, and extensive changes in these rules and regulations could increase the Company’s costs or adversely impact its sales. The Company cannot predict whether any such rules or regulations will be enacted or, if enacted, the impact that such rules or regulations could have on its business.In response to growing health, nutrition and wellness concerns for today’s youth, a number of states and local governments have regulations restricting the sale of soft drinks and other foods in schools, particularly elementary, middle and high schools. Many of these restrictions have existed for several years in connection with subsidized meal programs in schools. Additionally, legislation has been proposed by certain state and local governments to limit or restrict the sale of energy drinks to minors and/or persons below a specified age and/or to restrict the venues in which energy drinks can be sold. Restrictive legislation, if widely enacted, could have an adverse impact on the Company’s products, sales and reputation.Legislation has been proposed in Congress and by certain state and local governments which would prohibit the sale of soft drink products in non-refillable bottles and cans or require a mandatory deposit as a means of encouraging the return of such containers, each in an attempt to reduce solid waste and litter. Similarly, the Company is aware of proposed legislation that would impose fees or taxes on various types of containers used in its business. The Company is not currently impacted by the policies in these types of proposed legislation, but it is possible that similar or more restrictive legal requirements may be proposed or enacted within its distribution territories in the future.Concerns about perceived negative safety and quality consequences of certain ingredients in the Company’s products, such as non-nutritive sweeteners or ingredients in energy drinks, could result in additional governmental regulations concerning the production, marketing, labeling or availability of the Company’s products or the ingredients in such products, possible new taxes or negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against the Company or other companies in the same industry, any of which 11could damage the reputation of the Company or reduce demand for the Company’s products, which could adversely affect the Company’s profitability.The FDA occasionally proposes major changes to the nutrition labels required on all packaged foods and beverages, including those for most of the Company’s products, which could require the Company and its competitors to revise nutrition labels to include updated serving sizes, information about total calories in a beverage product container and information about any added sugars or nutrients. Any pervasive nutrition label changes could increase the Company’s costs and could inhibit sales of one or more of the Company’s major products.Most beverage products sold by the Company are classified as food or food products and are therefore eligible for purchase using SNAP benefits by consumers purchasing them for home consumption. Energy drinks with a nutrition facts label are also classified as food and are eligible for purchase for home consumption using SNAP benefits, whereas energy drinks classified as a supplement by the FDA are not. Regulators may restrict the use of benefit programs, including SNAP, to purchase certain beverages and foods currently classified as food or food products.The Company relies on The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies to invest in the Company through marketing funding and to promote their own company brand identity through external advertising, marketing spending and product innovation. Decreases from historic levels of investment could negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations or profitability.The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies have historically provided financial support to the Company through marketing funding. While the Company does not believe there will be significant changes to the amount of marketing funding support provided by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies, the Company’s beverage agreements generally do not obligate such funding and there can be no assurance the historic levels will continue. Decreases in the level of marketing funding provided, material changes in the marketing funding programs’ performance requirements or the Company’s inability to meet the performance requirements for marketing funding could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations or profitability.In addition, The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies have their own external advertising campaigns, marketing spending and product innovation programs, which directly impact the Company’s operations. Decreases in advertising, marketing and product innovation spending by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies, or advertising campaigns that are negatively perceived by the public, could adversely impact the sales volume growth and profitability of the Company. While the Company does not believe there will be significant changes in the level of external advertising and marketing spending by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies, there can be no assurance the historic levels will continue or that advertising campaigns will be positively perceived by the public. The Company’s volume growth is also dependent on product innovation by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies, and their ability to develop and introduce products that meet consumer preferences.The Company is a participant in several Coca‑Cola system governance entities, and decisions made by these governance entities may be different than decisions that would have been made by the Company individually. Any failure of these governance entities to function efficiently or on the best behalf of the Company and any failure or delay of the Company to receive anticipated benefits from these governance entities could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company is a member of CONA and party to an amended and restated master services agreement with CONA, pursuant to which the Company is an authorized user of the CONA System, a uniform information technology system developed to promote operational efficiency and uniformity among North American Coca‑Cola bottlers. The Company relies on CONA to make necessary upgrades to and resolve ongoing or disaster-related technology issues with the CONA System, and it is limited in its authority and ability to timely resolve errors or to make changes to the CONA software. Any service interruptions of the CONA System could result in increased costs or adversely impact the Company’s results of operations. In addition, because other Coca‑Cola bottlers are also users of the CONA System and would likely experience similar service interruptions, the Company may not be able to have another bottler process orders on its behalf during any such interruption.The Company is also a member of the NPSG, which is comprised of The Coca‑Cola Company, the Company and certain other Coca‑Cola bottlers who are regional producing bottlers in The Coca‑Cola Company’s national product supply system. Pursuant to the NPSG Agreement, the Company has agreed to abide by decisions made by the NPSG Board, which include decisions regarding strategic infrastructure investment and divestment planning, optimal national product supply sourcing and new product or packaging infrastructure planning. Although the Company has a representative on the NPSG Board, the Company cannot exercise sole decision-making authority relating to the decisions of the NPSG Board, and the interests of other members of the NPSG Board may diverge from those of the Company. Any such divergence could have a material adverse effect on the operating and financial results of the Company.12Provisions in the CBA and the RMA with The Coca‑Cola Company could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or a sale of the Company’s Coca‑Cola distribution or manufacturing businesses.Provisions in the CBA and the RMA require the Company to obtain The Coca‑Cola Company’s prior approval of a potential buyer of the Company’s Coca‑Cola distribution or manufacturing businesses, which could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or the Company’s ability to sell such businesses. The Company can obtain a list of pre-approved third-party buyers from The Coca‑Cola Company annually. In addition, the Company can seek buyer-specific approval from The Coca‑Cola Company upon receipt of a third-party offer to purchase the Company or its Coca‑Cola distribution or manufacturing businesses. If a change in control or sale of one of our businesses is delayed or prevented by the provisions in the CBA and the RMA, the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected.The concentration of the Company’s capital stock ownership with the Harrison family limits other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters.Members of the Harrison family, including the Company’s Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, J. Frank Harrison, III, beneficially own shares representing approximately 86% of the total voting power of the Company’s total outstanding Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on a consolidated basis. In addition, three members of the Harrison family, including Mr. Harrison, serve on the Company’s Board of Directors.As a result, members of the Harrison family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over the Company’s management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by the Company’s stockholders. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control otherwise favored by the Company’s other stockholders and could depress the stock price or limit other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters, which could result in the Company making decisions that stockholders outside the Harrison family may not view as beneficial.The Company’s inability to meet requirements under its beverage agreements could result in the loss of distribution and manufacturing rights.Under the CBA and the RMA, which authorize the Company to distribute and/or manufacture products of The Coca‑Cola Company, and pursuant to the Company’s distribution agreements with other beverage companies, the Company must satisfy various requirements, such as making minimum capital expenditures or maintaining certain performance rates. Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in the loss of distribution and manufacturing rights for the respective products under one or more of these beverage agreements. The occurrence of other events defined in these agreements could also result in the termination of one or more beverage agreements.The RMA also requires the Company to provide and sell covered beverages to other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers at prices established pursuant to the RMA. As the timing and quantity of such requests by other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers can be unpredictable, any failure by the Company to adequately plan for such demand could also constrain the Company’s supply chain network.Changes in the inputs used to calculate the Company’s acquisition related contingent consideration liability could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s acquisition related contingent consideration liability, which totaled $542.1 million as of December 31, 2021, consists of the estimated amounts due to The Coca‑Cola Company as sub-bottling payments under the CBA with The Coca‑Cola Company and CCR over the useful life of the related distribution rights. Changes in business conditions or other events could materially change both the future cash flow projections and the discount rate used in the calculation of the fair value of contingent consideration under the CBA. These changes could result in material changes to the fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration and could materially impact the amount of non-cash expense (or income) recorded each reporting period.General Risk Factors
Technology failures or cyberattacks on the Company’s technology systems or the Company’s effective response to technology failures or cyberattacks on its customers’, suppliers’ or other third parties’ technology systems could disrupt the Company’s operations and negatively impact the Company’s reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.The Company increasingly relies on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information. Like most companies, the Company’s information technology systems are vulnerable to interruption due to a variety of events beyond the Company’s control, including, but not limited to, power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, other malicious computer programs and cyberattacks, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, 13tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, usage errors by employees and other security issues. In addition, third-party providers of data hosting or cloud services, as well as other vendors, customers and suppliers, are vulnerable to cybersecurity incidents involving data the Company shares with them.The third-party service provider for our employee digital timekeeping system suffered a cybersecurity incident that prevented us from accessing the information contained therein during the fourth quarter of 2021 and continuing through the beginning of 2022. The Company immediately responded and implemented mitigation measures to reduce disruptions to our normal operations during the period we could not access the system. While the information technology system and data incidents we have experienced in the past (including the incident involving our employee digital timekeeping system) have not materially impacted our business operations, we expect to continue experiencing these types of incidents in the future, one or more of which could significantly impact the Company.The Company depends heavily upon the efficient operation of technological resources and a failure in these technology systems or controls could negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the Company continuously upgrades and updates current technology or installs new technology. In order to address risks to its technology systems, the Company continues to monitor networks and systems, upgrade security policies and train its employees, and it requires third-party service providers and business partners, customers, suppliers and other third parties to do the same. The inability to implement upgrades, updates or installations in a timely manner, to train employees effectively in the use of new or updated technology, or to obtain the anticipated benefits of the Company’s technology could adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or profitability.The Company has technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate its risk to these vulnerabilities; however, these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to ensure that the Company’s operations are not disrupted. If the Company’s technology systems, or those of its third-party service providers or business partners, are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, the Company may incur significant financial and other resources to mitigate, upgrade, repair or replace them, and the Company may suffer interruptions in its business operations, resulting in lost revenues and potential delays in reporting its financial results.Further, misuse, leakage or falsification of the Company’s information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations and damage the reputation and credibility of the Company. The Company may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to the Company, current or former employees, bottling partners, other customers, suppliers or consumers, and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight. The Company could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information technology systems, including liability for stolen information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation expense and increased insurance premiums.The Company’s financial condition can be impacted by the stability of the general economy.Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions or in the geographic markets in which the Company does business may have the temporary effect of reducing the demand for certain of the Company’s products. For example, economic forces may cause consumers to shift away from purchasing higher-margin products and packages sold through immediate consumption and other highly profitable channels. Periods of sustained high inflation may have adverse impacts on demand for the Company’s products and on the Company’s ability to sustain margins due to higher input costs. Adverse economic conditions could also increase the likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which would increase the risk of uncollectability of certain accounts. Each of these factors could adversely affect the Company’s overall business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s capital structure, including its cash positions and borrowing capacity with banks or other financial institutions and financial markets, exposes it to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of the Company’s counterparties were to become insolvent or enter bankruptcy, the Company’s ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. Consequently, the Company’s access to capital may be diminished. Any such event of default or failure could negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in the Company’s top customer relationships and marketing strategies could impact sales volume and revenues.The Company faces concentration risks related to a few customers comprising a large portion of the Company’s annual sales volume and net revenue. The Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if revenue from one or more of these significant customers is materially reduced or if the cost of complying with the customers’ demands is 14significant. Additionally, if receivables from one or more of these significant customers become uncollectible, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.The Company’s largest customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and The Kroger Company, accounted for approximately 33% of the Company’s 2021 bottle/can sales volume to retail customers and approximately 23% of the Company’s 2021 total net sales. These customers typically make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand and customer service performance and generally do not enter into long-term contracts. The Company faces risks related to maintaining the volume demanded on a short-term basis from these customers, which can also divert resources away from other customers. The loss of Wal‑Mart Stores, Inc. or The Kroger Company as a customer could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company.Further, the Company’s net sales are affected by promotion of the Company’s products by significant customers, such as in-store displays created by customers or the promotion of the Company’s products in customers’ periodic advertising. If the Company’s significant customers change the manner in which they market or promote the Company’s products, or if the marketing efforts by significant customers become ineffective, the Company’s sales volume and revenue could be adversely impacted.The Company may not be able to respond successfully to changes in the marketplace.The Company operates in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverage industry and faces strong competition from other general and specialty beverage companies. The Company’s response to continued and increased customer and competitor consolidations and marketplace competition may result in lower than expected net pricing of the Company’s products. The Company’s ability to gain or maintain the Company’s share of sales or gross margins may be limited by the actions of the Company’s competitors, which may have advantages in setting prices due to lower raw material costs.Competitive pressures in the markets in which the Company operates may cause channel and product mix to shift away from more profitable channels and packages. If the Company is unable to maintain or increase volume in higher-margin products and in packages sold through higher-margin channels, such as immediate consumption, pricing and gross margins could be adversely affected. Any related efforts by the Company to improve pricing and/or gross margin may result in lower than expected sales volume.In addition, the Company’s sales of finished goods to The Coca‑Cola Company and other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers are governed by the RMA, pursuant to which the prices, or certain elements of the formulas used to determine the prices, for such finished goods are unilaterally established by The Coca‑Cola Company from time to time. This limits the Company’s ability to adjust pricing in response to changes in the marketplace, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in the Company’s level of debt, borrowing costs and credit ratings could impact access to capital and credit markets, restrict the Company’s operating flexibility and limit the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing to fund future needs.As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $723.4 million of debt outstanding. The Company’s level of debt requires a substantial portion of future cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest, which reduces funds available for other purposes. The Company’s debt level can negatively impact its operations by limiting the Company’s ability to, and/or increasing its cost to, access credit markets for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; increasing the Company’s vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions by limiting the Company’s ability to react to changing economic and business conditions; and exposing the Company to increased risk that the Company will not be able to refinance the principal amount of debt as it becomes due or that a significant decrease in cash flows from operations could make it difficult for the Company to meet its debt service requirements and to comply with financial covenants in its debt agreements.The Company’s acquisition related contingent consideration, revolving credit facility, term loan facility and pension and postretirement medical benefits are subject to changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase in the future, the Company’s borrowing costs could increase, which could negatively impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and limit the Company’s ability to spend in other areas of the business. Further, a decline in the interest rates used to discount the Company’s pension and postretirement medical liabilities could increase the cost of these benefits and the amount of the liabilities.In 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) announced that it will not require banks to submit rates for the London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) after 2021. In March 2021, the FCA extended the transition dates of certain LIBOR tenors (including all U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors other than one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors) to June 30, 2023, after which LIBOR reference rates will cease to be provided. The Company has identified its $500 million revolving credit facility as its only LIBOR-indexed financial instrument which extends after 2023 and has included successor LIBOR rate provisions in the underlying loan agreement based on the Alternative Reference Rates Committee’s suggested fallback language. The revolving credit facility’s underlying loan agreement provides that the Secured Overnight Funding Rate (the “SOFR”) will be used as the LIBOR 15replacement rate for borrowings under the facility unless the Company and its lenders agree to an alternative reference rate based on prevailing market convention at the replacement date. The use of alternative reference rates or other reforms could cause the interest rate calculated for the Company’s revolving credit facility to be materially different than expected. As of December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility and currently does not expect the discontinuation of LIBOR to have a material effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.In assessing the Company’s credit strength, credit rating agencies consider the Company’s capital structure, financial policies, consolidated balance sheet and other financial information, and may also consider financial information of other bottling and beverage companies. The Company’s credit ratings could be significantly impacted by the Company’s operating performance, changes in the methodologies used by rating agencies to assess the Company’s credit ratings, changes in The Coca‑Cola Company’s credit ratings and the rating agencies’ perception of the impact of credit market conditions on the Company’s current or future financial performance. Lower credit ratings could significantly increase the Company’s borrowing costs or adversely affect the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing at acceptable interest rates or to refinance existing debt.Failure to attract, train and retain qualified employees while controlling labor costs, and other labor issues could have an adverse effect on the Company’s reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations or profitability.The Company’s future growth and performance depend on its ability to attract, hire, train, develop, motivate and retain a highly skilled, diverse and properly credentialed workforce. The Company’s ability to meet its labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to many external factors, including competition for and availability of qualified personnel in a given market, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage laws, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment and labor laws or other workplace regulations. The Company’s labor costs could be impacted by new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws that are adopted or implemented. Any unplanned turnover or unsuccessful implementation of the Company’s succession plans could deplete the Company’s institutional knowledge base and erode its competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect the Company’s reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.The Company uses various insurance structures to manage costs related to workers’ compensation, auto liability, medical and other insurable risks. These structures consist of retentions, deductibles, limits and a diverse group of insurers that serve to strategically finance, transfer and mitigate the financial impact of losses to the Company. Losses are accrued using assumptions and procedures followed in the insurance industry, then adjusted for company-specific history and expectations. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations.In addition, the Company’s profitability is substantially affected by the cost of pension retirement benefits, postretirement medical benefits and current employees’ medical benefits. Macro-economic factors beyond the Company’s control, including increases in healthcare costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities, could result in significant increases in these costs for the Company. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations.Failure to maintain productive relationships with our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, including failing to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Approximately 13% of the Company’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Any inability of the Company to renegotiate subsequent agreements with labor unions on satisfactory terms and conditions could result in work interruptions or stoppages, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s profitability. In addition, the terms and conditions of existing or renegotiated agreements could increase costs or otherwise affect the Company’s ability to fully implement operational changes to improve overall efficiency.Certain employees of the Company whose employment is covered under collective bargaining agreements participate in a multiemployer pension plan, the Employers-Teamsters Local Union Nos. 175 and 505 Pension Fund (the “Teamsters Plan”). Participating in the Teamsters Plan involves certain risks in addition to the risks associated with single employer pension plans, as contributed assets are pooled and may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer stops contributing to the Teamsters Plan, the unfunded obligations of the Teamsters Plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If the Company chooses to stop participating in the Teamsters Plan, the Company could be required to pay the Teamsters Plan a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the Teamsters Plan.16Changes in tax laws, disagreements with tax authorities or additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The Company is subject to income taxes within the United States. The Company’s annual income tax rate is based upon the Company’s income, federal tax laws and various state and local tax laws within the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Changes in federal, state or local income tax rates and/or tax laws could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial results.Excise or other taxes imposed on the sale of certain of the Company’s products by the federal government and certain state and local governments, particularly any taxes incorporated into shelf prices and passed along to consumers, could cause consumers to shift away from purchasing products of the Company, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business and financial results.Governmental authorities in the United States may increase or impose new income taxes or indirect taxes, or revise interpretations of existing tax rules and regulations, as a means to finance the cost of stimulus packages and other relief measures enacted or taken, or that may be enacted or taken in the future, to protect populations and economies from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such actions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.In addition, an assessment of additional taxes resulting from audits of the Company’s tax filings could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability, cash flows and financial condition.Litigation or legal proceedings could expose the Company to significant liabilities and damage the Company’s reputation.The Company is from time to time a party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, litigation claims and legal proceedings arising out of its advertising and marketing practices, product claims and labels, intellectual property and commercial disputes, and environmental and employment matters. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, the Company records reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Although the Company does not believe a material amount of loss in excess of recorded amounts is reasonably possible as a result of these claims, the Company faces risk of an adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows, depending on the outcome of the legal proceedings.Natural disasters, changing weather patterns and unfavorable weather could negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition and future results of operations or profitability.Natural disasters or unfavorable weather conditions in the geographic regions in which the Company or its suppliers operate could have an adverse impact on the Company’s revenue and profitability. For instance, unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for the Company’s products and contribute to lower sales, which could adversely affect the Company’s profitability for such periods. Prolonged drought conditions could lead to restrictions on water use, which could adversely affect the Company’s cost and ability to manufacture and distribute products. Hurricanes or similar storms may have a negative sourcing impact or cause shifts in product mix to lower-margin products and packages.Climate change may have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could cause significant changes in weather patterns and an increase in the frequency or duration of extreme weather and climate events. These changes could adversely impact some of the Company’s facilities, the availability and cost of key raw materials used by the Company in production or the demand for the Company’s products. Public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require the Company to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. In addition, federal, state or local governmental authorities may propose legislative and regulatory initiatives in response to concerns over climate change which could directly or indirectly adversely affect the Company’s business, require additional investments or increase the cost of raw materials, fuel, ingredients and water. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on the Company’s business and results of operations"
8,COKE,COCA-COLA BTLNG CONS,2021-02-26,"Risk Factors
.In addition to other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company’s business. The Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.Risks Related to Our BusinessThe Company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials, fuel and other supplies.Raw material costs, including the costs for plastic bottles, aluminum cans, PET resin and high fructose corn syrup, are subject to significant price volatility. International or domestic geopolitical or other events, including the imposition of tariffs and/or quotas by the U.S. government on any of these raw materials, could adversely impact the supply and cost of these raw materials to the Company. In addition, there are no limits on the prices The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies can charge for concentrate. If the Company cannot offset higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, effective commodity price hedging, increased sales volume or reductions in other costs, the Company’s results of operations and profitability could be adversely affected.Continued consolidation among suppliers of certain of the Company’s raw materials could have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to negotiate the lowest costs and, in light of the Company’s relatively low in-plant raw material inventory levels, has the potential for causing interruptions in the Company’s supply of raw materials and in its manufacture of finished goods.The Company purchases all of the plastic bottles used in its manufacturing plants from Southeastern Container and Western Container, two manufacturing cooperatives the Company co-owns with several other Coca‑Cola bottlers, and a majority of its aluminum cans from two domestic suppliers. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant tightening in the domestic market for aluminum cans due to changing consumer purchasing patterns and, as a result, the Company changed its typical sourcing model and sourced aluminum cans from international locations and may continue to do so if the domestic supply of aluminum cans remains constrained. The inability of these plastic bottle or aluminum can suppliers to meet the Company’s requirements for containers could result in the Company not being able to fulfill customer orders and production demand until alternative sources of supply are located. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate. Failure of the plastic bottle or aluminum can suppliers to meet the Company’s purchase requirements could negatively impact inventory levels, customer confidence and results of operations, including sales levels and profitability.The Company uses a combination of internal and external freight shipping and transportation services to transport and deliver products. The Company’s freight cost and the timely delivery of its products may be adversely impacted by a number of factors which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations, including driver shortages, reduced availability of independent contractor drivers, higher fuel costs, weather conditions, traffic congestion, increased government regulation and other matters.In addition, the Company uses significant amounts of fuel for its delivery fleet and other vehicles used in the distribution of its products. International or domestic geopolitical or other events could impact the supply and cost of fuel and the timely delivery of the Company’s products to its customers. Although the Company strives to reduce fuel consumption and uses commodity hedges to manage the Company’s fuel costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting the impact of fuel price volatility on the Company’s business or future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations.The Company continues to make significant reinvestments in its business in order to evolve its operating model and to accommodate future growth and portfolio expansion, including supply chain optimization. The increased costs associated with these reinvestments, the potential for disruption in manufacturing and distribution and the risk the Company may not realize a satisfactory return on its investments could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.The reliance on purchased finished products from external sources could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability.The Company does not, and does not plan to, manufacture all products it distributes and, therefore, remains reliant on purchased finished products from external sources to meet customer demand. As a result, the Company is subject to incremental risk, including, but not limited to, product quality and availability, price variability and production capacity shortfalls for externally purchased finished products, which could have an impact on the Company’s profitability and customer relationships. In most instances, the Company’s ability to negotiate the prices at which it purchases finished products from other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers is limited pursuant to The Coca‑Cola Company’s right to unilaterally establish the prices, or certain elements of the formulas used to determine the prices, for such finished products under the RMA, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability.9Changes in public and consumer perception and preferences, including concerns related to obesity, artificial ingredients, product safety and sustainability and brand reputation, could reduce demand for the Company’s products and reduce profitability.The Company’s business depends substantially on consumer tastes, preferences and shopping habits that change in often unpredictable ways. As a result of certain health and wellness trends, consumer preferences over the past several years have shifted from sugar-sweetened sparkling beverages to diet sparkling beverages, tea, sports drinks, enhanced water and bottled water. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, consumer demand shifted in 2020 from products sold for immediate consumption through smaller retail stores and on‑premise locations to take-home products sold in grocery stores, mass merchandise stores and club stores. In addition, consumers, public health officials, public health advocates and government officials have become increasingly concerned about the public health consequences associated with obesity. As the Company distributes, markets and manufactures beverage brands owned by others, the success of the Company’s business depends in large measure on the ability of The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies to develop and introduce product innovations to meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market, and failure to satisfy these consumer preferences could adversely affect the Company’s profitability.Concerns about perceived negative safety and quality consequences of certain ingredients in the Company’s products, such as non-nutritive sweeteners or ingredients in energy drinks, may erode consumers’ confidence in the safety and quality of the Company’s products, whether or not justified. The Company’s business is also impacted by changes in consumer concerns or perceptions surrounding the product manufacturing processes and packaging materials, including single-use and other plastic packaging, and the environmental and sustainability impact of such manufacturing processes and packaging materials. Any of these factors may reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase the Company’s products and any inability on the part of the Company to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for the Company’s products or erode the Company’s competitive and financial position and could adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.The Company’s success depends on its ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of its products. The Company has rigorous product safety and quality standards. However, if beverage products taken to market are or become contaminated or adulterated, the Company may be required to conduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which could cause its business and reputation to suffer.The Company’s success also depends in large part on its ability and the ability of The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies it works with to maintain the brand image of existing products, build up brand image for new products and brand extensions and maintain its corporate reputation and social license to operate. Engagements by the Company’s executives in social and public policy debates may occasionally be the subject of criticism from advocacy groups that have differing points of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. Similarly, the Company’s sponsorship relationships and charitable giving program could subject the Company to negative publicity as a result of actual or perceived views of organizations the Company sponsors or supports financially. Likewise, negative postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company, The Coca‑Cola Company or one of the products the Company carries, even if inaccurate or malicious, could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of the Company’s brands or the Company.Changes in government regulations related to nonalcoholic beverages, including regulations related to obesity, public health, artificial ingredients and product safety and sustainability, could reduce demand for the Company’s products and reduce profitability.The Company’s business and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those governing the production, packaging, quality, labeling and distribution of beverage products. Compliance with or changes in existing laws or regulations could require material expenses and negatively affect our financial results through lower sales or higher costs.The production and marketing of beverages are subject to the rules and regulations of the FDA and other federal, state and local health agencies, and extensive changes in these rules and regulations could increase the Company’s costs or adversely impact its sales. The Company cannot predict whether any such rules or regulations will be enacted or, if enacted, the impact that such rules or regulations could have on its business.In response to growing health, nutrition and wellness concerns for today’s youth, a number of states and local governments have regulations restricting the sale of soft drinks and other foods in schools, particularly elementary, middle and high schools. Many of these restrictions have existed for several years in connection with subsidized meal programs in schools. Additionally, legislation has been proposed by certain state and local governments to limit or restrict the sale of energy drinks to minors and/or persons below a specified age and/or to restrict the venues in which energy drinks can be sold. Restrictive legislation, if widely enacted, could have an adverse impact on the Company’s products, sales and reputation.Legislation has been proposed in Congress and by certain state and local governments which would prohibit the sale of soft drink products in non-refillable bottles and cans or require a mandatory deposit as a means of encouraging the return of such containers, 10each in an attempt to reduce solid waste and litter. Similarly, the Company is aware of proposed legislation that would impose fees or taxes on various types of containers used in its business. The Company is not currently impacted by the policies in these types of proposed legislation, but it is possible that similar or more restrictive legal requirements may be proposed or enacted within its distribution territories in the future.Concerns about perceived negative safety and quality consequences of certain ingredients in the Company’s products, such as non-nutritive sweeteners or ingredients in energy drinks, could result in additional governmental regulations concerning the production, marketing, labeling or availability of the Company’s products or the ingredients in such products, possible new taxes or negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against the Company or other companies in the same industry, any of which could damage the reputation of the Company or reduce demand for the Company’s products, which could adversely affect the Company’s profitability.The FDA occasionally proposes major changes to the nutrition labels required on all packaged foods and beverages, including those for most of the Company’s products, which could require the Company and its competitors to revise nutrition labels to include updated serving sizes, information about total calories in a beverage product container and information about any added sugars or nutrients. Any pervasive nutrition label changes could increase the Company’s costs and could inhibit sales of one or more of the Company’s major products.Most beverage products sold by the Company are classified as food or food products and are therefore eligible for purchase using SNAP benefits by consumers purchasing them for home consumption. Energy drinks with a nutrition facts label are also classified as food and are eligible for purchase for home consumption using SNAP benefits, whereas energy drinks classified as a supplement by the FDA are not. Regulators may restrict the use of benefit programs, including SNAP, to purchase certain beverages and foods currently classified as food or food products.The COVID-19 pandemic and other pandemic outbreaks in the future could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is continuing to have, a significant impact on our business and results of operations, as government-imposed restrictions on social and commercial activity to promote social distancing has caused significant changes to consumer purchasing behavior. Future pandemics may also pose risks similar to, or more severe than, the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Such risks are impossible to predict at this time. Any of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those described below, alone or in combination with others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.•The closing or restricted operations of many public locations caused a decrease in sales volume in on-premise locations. This negative trend is likely to continue during 2021, and, if the COVID‑19 pandemic continues or intensifies, its negative impact on our net sales may persist or become more severe. In 2020, we experienced increased sales volume in our larger retail customer outlets as consumers stocked up on certain of our products with the expectation of spending more time at home during the pandemic; however, such increased sales volume may not continue in the long term and may not offset the margin pressure we are experiencing in our on-premise locations.•Consumer demand shifted from higher margin products sold for immediate consumption through smaller retail stores and on-premise locations to lower margin, take-home products sold in grocery stores, mass merchandise stores and club stores. We expect this shift in consumer purchasing behavior to continue while shelter-in-place and social distancing behaviors are mandated or encouraged, and possibly for a period of time thereafter.•The COVID-19 pandemic caused, and future pandemics may cause, deteriorating economic conditions in our territories, such as increasing unemployment, declining consumer confidence, or economic slowdowns or recessions, which could cause an overall decrease in demand for our products or a shift in the types of products sold.•Disruptions in our concentrate suppliers’ production and distribution operations could increase concentrate costs and create delays in delivery of concentrate, which could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and distribute certain products. Further, disruptions in supply chains have placed, and may continue to place, constraints on our ability to procure beverage containers, such as plastic bottles and aluminum cans. These supply chain disruptions have increased, and in the future could increase further, our packaging costs and alter the product offerings to our customers.•We may be required to write off obsolete inventory, accounts receivable and balances of advanced funding provided to customers that permanently close or suffer financial hardships as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemics.11•Governmental authorities in the United States may increase or impose new income taxes or indirect taxes, or revise interpretations of existing tax rules and regulations, as a means to finance the cost of stimulus packages and other relief measures enacted or taken, or that may be enacted or taken in the future, to protect populations and economies from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Alternatively, concerns about the difficulty or desirability of financing additional fiscal stimulus at the federal level could prevent such stimulus from being authorized in a timely manner or at all. Such actions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.•We rely on third-party service providers and business partners, such as cloud data storage and other information technology service providers, suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners and other external business partners, for certain functions or for services in support of key portions of our operations. These third-party service providers and business partners are subject to risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may interfere with their ability to fulfill their respective commitments and responsibilities to us in a timely manner and in accordance with our agreed-upon terms.•As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including related governmental guidance or directives, we have encouraged, and in some cases required, most office-based employees, including most employees based at our corporate headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina, to work remotely. We may experience reductions in productivity and disruptions to our business routines while our remote-work policy remains in place.•Actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, because of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in legal claims or litigation against us.•The resumption of normal business operations after the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may be delayed or constrained by its lingering effects on our consumers, customers, suppliers and/or third-party service providers and business partners.The Company relies on The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies to invest in the Company through marketing funding and to promote their own company brand identity through external advertising, marketing spending and product innovation. Decreases from historic levels of investment could negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations or profitability.The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies have historically provided financial support to the Company through marketing funding. While the Company does not believe there will be significant changes to the amount of marketing funding support provided by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies, the Company’s beverage agreements generally do not obligate such funding and there can be no assurance the historic levels will continue. Decreases in the level of marketing funding provided, material changes in the marketing funding programs’ performance requirements or the Company’s inability to meet the performance requirements for marketing funding could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations or profitability.In addition, The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies have their own external advertising campaigns, marketing spending and product innovation programs, which directly impact the Company’s operations. Decreases in advertising, marketing and product innovation spending by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies, or advertising campaigns that are negatively perceived by the public, could adversely impact the sales volume growth and profitability of the Company. While the Company does not believe there will be significant changes in the level of external advertising and marketing spending by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies, there can be no assurance the historic levels will continue or that advertising campaigns will be positively perceived by the public. The Company’s volume growth is also dependent on product innovation by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies, and their ability to develop and introduce products that meet consumer preferences.The Company is a participant in several Coca‑Cola system governance entities, and decisions made by these governance entities may be different than decisions that would have been made by the Company individually. Any failure of these governance entities to function efficiently or on the best behalf of the Company and any failure or delay of the Company to receive anticipated benefits from these governance entities could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company is a member of CONA and party to an amended and restated master services agreement with CONA, pursuant to which the Company is an authorized user of the CONA System, a uniform information technology system developed to promote operational efficiency and uniformity among North American Coca‑Cola bottlers. The Company relies on CONA to make necessary upgrades to and resolve ongoing or disaster-related technology issues with the CONA System, and it is limited in its authority and ability to timely resolve errors or to make changes to the CONA software. Any service interruptions of the CONA System could result in increased costs or adversely impact the Company’s results of operations. In addition, because other Coca‑Cola bottlers are also users of the 12CONA System and would likely experience similar service interruptions, the Company may not be able to have another bottler process orders on its behalf during any such interruption.The Company is also a member of the NPSG, which is comprised of The Coca‑Cola Company, the Company and certain other Coca‑Cola bottlers who are regional producing bottlers in The Coca‑Cola Company’s national product supply system. Pursuant to the NPSG Governance Agreement, the Company has agreed to abide by decisions made by the NPSG Board, which include decisions regarding strategic infrastructure investment and divestment planning, optimal national product supply sourcing and new product or packaging infrastructure planning. Although the Company has a representative on the NPSG Board, the Company cannot exercise sole decision-making authority relating to the decisions of the NPSG Board, and the interests of other members of the NPSG Board may diverge from those of the Company. Any such divergence could have a material adverse effect on the operating and financial results of the Company.Provisions in the CBA and the RMA with The Coca‑Cola Company could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or a sale of the Company’s Coca‑Cola distribution or manufacturing businesses.Provisions in the CBA and the RMA require the Company to obtain The Coca‑Cola Company’s prior approval of a potential buyer of the Company’s Coca‑Cola distribution or manufacturing businesses, which could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or the Company’s ability to sell such businesses. The Company can obtain a list of pre-approved third-party buyers from The Coca‑Cola Company annually. In addition, the Company can seek buyer-specific approval from The Coca‑Cola Company upon receipt of a third-party offer to purchase the Company or its Coca‑Cola distribution or manufacturing businesses. If a change in control or sale of one of our businesses is delayed or prevented by the provisions in the CBA and the RMA, the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected.The concentration of the Company’s capital stock ownership with the Harrison family limits other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters.Members of the Harrison family, including the Company’s Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, J. Frank Harrison, III, beneficially own shares representing approximately 86% of the total voting power of the Company’s total outstanding Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on a consolidated basis. In addition, three members of the Harrison family, including Mr. Harrison, serve on the Company’s Board of Directors.As a result, members of the Harrison family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over the Company’s management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by the Company’s stockholders. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control otherwise favored by the Company’s other stockholders and could depress the stock price or limit other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters, which could result in the Company making decisions that stockholders outside the Harrison family may not view as beneficial.The Company’s inability to meet requirements under its beverage agreements could result in the loss of distribution and manufacturing rights.Under the CBA and the RMA, which authorize the Company to distribute and/or manufacture products of The Coca‑Cola Company, and pursuant to the Company’s distribution agreements with other beverage companies, the Company must satisfy various requirements, such as making minimum capital expenditures or maintaining certain performance rates. Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in the loss of distribution and manufacturing rights for the respective products under one or more of these beverage agreements. The occurrence of other events defined in these agreements could also result in the termination of one or more beverage agreements.The RMA also requires the Company to provide and sell covered beverages to other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers at prices established pursuant to the RMA. As the timing and quantity of such requests by other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers can be unpredictable, any failure by the Company to adequately plan for such demand could also constrain the Company’s supply chain network.Changes in the inputs used to calculate the Company’s acquisition related contingent consideration liability could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s acquisition related contingent consideration liability, which totaled $434.7 million as of December 31, 2020, consists of the estimated amounts due to The Coca‑Cola Company as sub-bottling payments under the CBA with The Coca‑Cola Company and CCR over the useful life of the related distribution rights. Changes in business conditions or other events could materially change both the future cash flow projections and the discount rate used in the calculation of the fair value of contingent consideration under the CBA. These changes could result in material changes to the fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration and could materially impact the amount of non-cash expense (or income) recorded each reporting period.13General Risk Factors
Technology failures or cyberattacks on the Company’s technology systems or the Company’s effective response to technology failures or cyberattacks on its customers’, suppliers’ or other third parties’ technology systems could disrupt the Company’s operations and negatively impact the Company’s reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.The Company increasingly relies on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information. Like most companies, the Company’s information technology systems may be vulnerable to interruption due to a variety of events beyond the Company’s control, including, but not limited to, power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, other malicious computer programs and cyberattacks, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, usage errors by employees and other security issues. In addition, third-party providers of data hosting or cloud services, as well as customers and suppliers, could experience cybersecurity incidents involving data the Company shares with them.The Company depends heavily upon the efficient operation of technological resources and a failure in these technology systems or controls could negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the Company continuously upgrades and updates current technology or installs new technology. In order to address risks to its technology systems, the Company continues to monitor networks and systems, upgrade security policies and train its employees, and it requires third-party service providers and business partners, customers, suppliers and other third parties to do the same. The inability to implement upgrades, updates or installations in a timely manner, to train employees effectively in the use of new or updated technology, or to obtain the anticipated benefits of the Company’s technology could adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or profitability.The Company has technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate its risk to these vulnerabilities; however, these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to ensure that the Company’s operations are not disrupted. If the Company’s technology systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, it may incur significant financial and other resources to upgrade, repair or replace them, and the Company may suffer interruptions in its business operations, resulting in lost revenues and potential delays in reporting its financial results.Further, misuse, leakage or falsification of the Company’s information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations and damage the reputation and credibility of the Company. The Company may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to the Company, current or former employees, bottling partners, other customers, suppliers or consumers, and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight. The Company could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information technology systems, including liability for stolen information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation expense and increased insurance premiums.The Company’s financial condition can be impacted by the stability of the general economy.Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions or in the geographic markets in which the Company does business may have the temporary effect of reducing the demand for certain of the Company’s products. For example, economic forces may cause consumers to shift away from purchasing higher-margin products and packages sold through immediate consumption and other highly profitable channels. Adverse economic conditions could also increase the likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which would increase the risk of uncollectability of certain accounts. Each of these factors could adversely affect the Company’s overall business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s capital structure, including its cash positions and borrowing capacity with banks or other financial institutions and financial markets, exposes it to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of the Company’s counterparties were to become insolvent or enter bankruptcy, the Company’s ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. Consequently, the Company’s access to capital may be diminished. Any such event of default or failure could negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in the Company’s top customer relationships and marketing strategies could impact sales volume and revenues.The Company faces concentration risks related to a few customers comprising a large portion of the Company’s annual sales volume and net revenue. The Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if revenue from 14one or more of these significant customers is materially reduced or if the cost of complying with the customers’ demands is significant. Additionally, if receivables from one or more of these significant customers become uncollectible, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.The Company’s largest customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and The Kroger Company, accounted for approximately 32% of the Company’s 2020 bottle/can sales volume to retail customers and approximately 24% of the Company’s 2020 total net sales. These customers typically make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand and customer service performance and generally do not enter into long-term contracts. The Company faces risks related to maintaining the volume demanded on a short-term basis from these customers, which can also divert resources away from other customers. The loss of Wal‑Mart Stores, Inc. or The Kroger Company as a customer could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company.Further, the Company’s net sales are affected by promotion of the Company’s products by significant customers, such as in-store displays created by customers or the promotion of the Company’s products in customers’ periodic advertising. If the Company’s significant customers change the manner in which they market or promote the Company’s products, or if the marketing efforts by significant customers become ineffective, the Company’s sales volume and revenue could be adversely impacted.The Company may not be able to respond successfully to changes in the marketplace.The Company operates in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverage industry and faces strong competition from other general and specialty beverage companies. The Company’s response to continued and increased customer and competitor consolidations and marketplace competition may result in lower than expected net pricing of the Company’s products. The Company’s ability to gain or maintain the Company’s share of sales or gross margins may be limited by the actions of the Company’s competitors, which may have advantages in setting prices due to lower raw material costs.Competitive pressures in the markets in which the Company operates may cause channel and product mix to shift away from more profitable channels and packages. If the Company is unable to maintain or increase volume in higher-margin products and in packages sold through higher-margin channels, such as immediate consumption, pricing and gross margins could be adversely affected. Any related efforts by the Company to improve pricing and/or gross margin may result in lower than expected sales volume.In addition, the Company’s sales of finished goods to The Coca‑Cola Company and other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers are governed by the RMA, pursuant to which the prices, or certain elements of the formulas used to determine the prices, for such finished goods are unilaterally established by The Coca‑Cola Company from time to time. This limits the Company’s ability to adjust pricing in response to changes in the marketplace, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in the Company’s level of debt, borrowing costs and credit ratings could impact access to capital and credit markets, restrict the Company’s operating flexibility and limit the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing to fund future needs.As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $940.5 million of debt outstanding. The Company’s level of debt requires a substantial portion of future cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest, which reduces funds available for other purposes. The Company’s debt level can negatively impact its operations by limiting the Company’s ability to, and/or increasing its cost to, access credit markets for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; increasing the Company’s vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions by limiting the Company’s ability to react to changing economic and business conditions; and exposing the Company to increased risk that the Company will not be able to refinance the principal amount of debt as it becomes due or that a significant decrease in cash flows from operations could make it difficult for the Company to meet its debt service requirements and to comply with financial covenants in its debt agreements.The Company’s acquisition related contingent consideration, revolving credit facility, term loan facility and pension and postretirement medical benefits are subject to changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase in the future, the Company’s borrowing costs could increase, which could negatively impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and limit the Company’s ability to spend in other areas of the business. Further, a decline in the interest rates used to discount the Company’s pension and postretirement medical liabilities could increase the cost of these benefits and the amount of the liabilities.In 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will not require banks to submit rates for the London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) after 2021. The Company has identified its revolving credit facility as its only LIBOR-indexed financial instrument which extends after 2021 and has included language in the underlying loan agreement which allows the Company and its lenders to agree to an alternative reference rate upon the discontinuation of LIBOR. The use of alternative reference rates or other reforms could cause the interest rate calculated for the Company’s revolving credit facility to be materially different than 15expected. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of and mitigate the risk associated with the expected discontinuation of LIBOR on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.In assessing the Company’s credit strength, credit rating agencies consider the Company’s capital structure, financial policies, consolidated balance sheet and other financial information, and may also consider financial information of other bottling and beverage companies. The Company’s credit ratings could be significantly impacted by the Company’s operating performance, changes in the methodologies used by rating agencies to assess the Company’s credit ratings, changes in The Coca‑Cola Company’s credit ratings and the rating agencies’ perception of the impact of credit market conditions on the Company’s current or future financial performance. Lower credit ratings could significantly increase the Company’s borrowing costs or adversely affect the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing at acceptable interest rates or to refinance existing debt.Failure to attract, train and retain qualified employees while controlling labor costs, and other labor issues could have an adverse effect on the Company’s reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations or profitability.The Company’s future growth and performance depend on its ability to attract, hire, train, develop, motivate and retain a highly skilled, diverse and properly credentialed workforce. The Company’s ability to meet its labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to many external factors, including competition for and availability of qualified personnel in a given market, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage laws, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment and labor laws or other workplace regulations. The Company’s labor costs could be impacted by new or revised labor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws that are adopted or implemented. Any unplanned turnover or unsuccessful implementation of the Company’s succession plans could deplete the Company’s institutional knowledge base and erode its competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect the Company’s reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.The Company uses various insurance structures to manage costs related to workers’ compensation, auto liability, medical and other insurable risks. These structures consist of retentions, deductibles, limits and a diverse group of insurers that serve to strategically finance, transfer and mitigate the financial impact of losses to the Company. Losses are accrued using assumptions and procedures followed in the insurance industry, then adjusted for company-specific history and expectations. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations.In addition, the Company’s profitability is substantially affected by the cost of pension retirement benefits, postretirement medical benefits and current employees’ medical benefits. Macro-economic factors beyond the Company’s control, including increases in healthcare costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities, could result in significant increases in these costs for the Company. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations.Failure to maintain productive relationships with our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, including failing to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Approximately 14% of the Company’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Any inability of the Company to renegotiate subsequent agreements with labor unions on satisfactory terms and conditions could result in work interruptions or stoppages, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s profitability. In addition, the terms and conditions of existing or renegotiated agreements could increase costs or otherwise affect the Company’s ability to fully implement operational changes to improve overall efficiency.Certain employees of the Company whose employment is covered under collective bargaining agreements participate in a multiemployer pension plan, the Employers-Teamsters Local Union Nos. 175 and 505 Pension Fund (the “Teamsters Plan”). Participating in the Teamsters Plan involves certain risks in addition to the risks associated with single employer pension plans, as contributed assets are pooled and may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer stops contributing to the Teamsters Plan, the unfunded obligations of the Teamsters Plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If the Company chooses to stop participating in the Teamsters Plan, the Company could be required to pay the Teamsters Plan a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the Teamsters Plan.16Changes in tax laws, disagreements with tax authorities or additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The Company is subject to income taxes within the United States. The Company’s annual income tax rate is based upon the Company’s income, federal tax laws and various state and local tax laws within the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Changes in federal, state or local income tax rates and/or tax laws could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial results.Excise or other taxes imposed on the sale of certain of the Company’s products by the federal government and certain state and local governments, particularly any taxes incorporated into shelf prices and passed along to consumers, could cause consumers to shift away from purchasing products of the Company, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business and financial results.In addition, an assessment of additional taxes resulting from audits of the Company’s tax filings could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability, cash flows and financial condition.Litigation or legal proceedings could expose the Company to significant liabilities and damage the Company’s reputation.The Company is from time to time a party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, litigation claims and legal proceedings arising out of its advertising and marketing practices, product claims and labels, intellectual property and commercial disputes, and environmental and employment matters. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, the Company records reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Although the Company does not believe a material amount of loss in excess of recorded amounts is reasonably possible as a result of these claims, the Company faces risk of an adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows, depending on the outcome of the legal proceedings.Natural disasters, changing weather patterns and unfavorable weather could negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition and future results of operations or profitability.Natural disasters or unfavorable weather conditions in the geographic regions in which the Company or its suppliers operate could have an adverse impact on the Company’s revenue and profitability. For instance, unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for the Company’s products and contribute to lower sales, which could adversely affect the Company’s profitability for such periods. Prolonged drought conditions could lead to restrictions on water use, which could adversely affect the Company’s cost and ability to manufacture and distribute products. Hurricanes or similar storms may have a negative sourcing impact or cause shifts in product mix to lower-margin products and packages.Climate change may have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could cause significant changes in weather patterns and an increase in the frequency or duration of extreme weather and climate events. These changes could adversely impact some of the Company’s facilities, the availability and cost of key raw materials used by the Company in production or the demand for the Company’s products. Public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require the Company to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. In addition, federal, state or local governmental authorities may propose legislative and regulatory initiatives in response to concerns over climate change which could directly or indirectly adversely affect the Company’s business, require additional investments or increase the cost of raw materials, fuel, ingredients and water. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on the Company’s business and results of operations"
11,COKE,COCA-COLA BTLNG CONS,2020-02-25,"Risk Factors
. In addition to other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company’s business. The Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. 9 The Company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials, fuel and other supplies. Raw material costs, including the costs for plastic bottles, aluminum cans, resin and high fructose corn syrup, have historically been subject to significant price volatility and may continue to be in the future. International or domestic geopolitical or other events, including the imposition of tariffs and/or quotas by the U.S. government on any of these raw materials, could adversely impact the supply and cost of these raw materials to the Company. In addition, there are no limits on the prices The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies can charge for concentrate. If the Company cannot offset higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, effective commodity price hedging, increased sales volume or reductions in other costs, the Company’s results of operations and profitability could be adversely affected. Continued consolidation among suppliers of certain of the Company’s raw materials could have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to negotiate the lowest costs and, in light of the Company’s relatively low in-plant raw material inventory levels, has the potential for causing interruptions in the Company’s supply of raw materials and in its manufacture of finished goods. The Company purchases all of its plastic bottles from Southeastern Container and Western Container, two manufacturing cooperatives the Company co-owns with several other Coca‑Cola bottlers, and all of its aluminum cans from two domestic suppliers. The inability of these plastic bottle or aluminum can suppliers to meet the Company’s requirements for containers could result in the Company not being able to fulfill customer orders and production demand until alternative sources of supply are located. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate. Failure of the plastic bottle or aluminum can suppliers to meet the Company’s purchase requirements could negatively impact inventory levels, customer confidence and results of operations, including sales levels and profitability. The Company uses a combination of internal and external freight shipping and transportation services to transport and deliver products. The Company’s freight cost and the timely delivery of its products may be adversely impacted by a number of factors which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations, including driver shortages, reduced availability of independent contractor drivers, higher fuel costs, weather conditions, traffic congestion, increased government regulation and other matters. In addition, the Company uses significant amounts of fuel for its delivery fleet and other vehicles used in the distribution of its products. International or domestic geopolitical or other events could impact the supply and cost of fuel and the timely delivery of the Company’s products to its customers. Although the Company strives to reduce fuel consumption and uses commodity hedges to manage the Company’s fuel costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting the impact of fuel price volatility on the Company’s business or future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations. The Company continues to make significant reinvestments in its business in order to evolve its operating model and to accommodate future growth and portfolio expansion, including supply chain optimization. The increased costs associated with these reinvestments, the potential for disruption in manufacturing and distribution and the risk the Company may not realize a satisfactory return on its investments could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. The reliance on purchased finished products from external sources could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability. The Company does not, and does not plan to, manufacture all products it distributes and, therefore, remains reliant on purchased finished products from external sources to meet customer demand. As a result, the Company is subject to incremental risk, including, but not limited to, product quality and availability, price variability and production capacity shortfalls for externally purchased finished products, which could have an impact on the Company’s profitability and customer relationships. In most instances, the Company’s ability to negotiate the prices at which it purchases finished products from other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers is limited pursuant to The Coca‑Cola Company’s right to unilaterally establish the prices, or certain elements of the formulas used to determine the prices, for such finished products under the RMA, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability. Changes in public and consumer perception and preferences, including concerns related to obesity, artificial ingredients, product safety and sustainability and brand reputation, could reduce demand for the Company’s products and reduce profitability. The Company’s business depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. Over the past several years, consumer preferences have shifted from sugar-sweetened sparkling beverages to diet sparkling beverages, tea, sports drinks, enhanced water and bottled water as a result of certain health and wellness trends. In addition, consumers, public health officials, public health advocates and government officials have become increasingly concerned about the public health consequences associated with obesity. As the Company distributes, markets and manufactures beverage brands owned by others, the success of the Company’s business depends in large measure on working with The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies. The Company is reliant upon the ability of The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies to develop and introduce product 10 innovations to meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market, and failure to satisfy these consumer preferences could adversely affect the Company’s profitability. Concerns about perceived negative safety and quality consequences of certain ingredients in the Company’s products, such as non-nutritive sweeteners, may erode consumers’ confidence in the safety and quality of the Company’s products, whether or not justified. The Company’s business is also impacted by changes in consumer concerns or perceptions surrounding the product manufacturing processes and packaging materials, including single-use and other plastic packaging, and the environmental and sustainability impact of such manufacturing processes and packaging. Any of these factors may reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase the Company’s products and any inability on the part of the Company to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for the Company’s products or erode the Company’s competitive and financial position and could adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. The Company’s success depends on its ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of its products. The Company has rigorous product safety and quality standards. However, if beverage products taken to market are or become contaminated or adulterated, the Company may be required to conduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which could cause its business and reputation to suffer. The Company’s success also depends in large part on its ability and the ability of The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies it works with to maintain the brand image of existing products, build up brand image for new products and brand extensions and maintain its corporate reputation and social license to operate. Engagements by the Company’s executives in social and public policy debates may occasionally be the subject of criticism from advocacy groups that have differing points of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. Similarly, the Company’s sponsorship relationships and charitable giving program could subject the Company to negative publicity as a result of actual or perceived views of organizations the Company sponsors or supports financially. Likewise, negative postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company, The Coca‑Cola Company or one of the products the Company carries, even if inaccurate or malicious, could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of the Company’s brands or the Company. Changes in government regulations related to nonalcoholic beverages, including regulations related to obesity, public health, artificial ingredients and product safety and sustainability, could reduce demand for the Company’s products and reduce profitability. The Company’s business and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those governing the production, packaging, quality, labeling and distribution of beverage products. Compliance with or changes in existing laws or regulations could require material expenses and negatively affect our financial results through lower sales or higher costs. The production and marketing of beverages are subject to the rules and regulations of the FDA and other federal, state and local health agencies, and extensive changes in these rules and regulations could increase the Company’s costs or adversely impact its sales. The Company cannot predict whether any such rules or regulations will be enacted or, if enacted, the impact that such rules or regulations could have on its business. In response to growing health, nutrition and obesity concerns for today’s youth, a number of states and local governments have regulations restricting the sale of soft drinks and other foods in schools, particularly elementary, middle and high schools. Many of these restrictions have existed for several years in connection with subsidized meal programs in schools. Restrictive legislation, if widely enacted, could have an adverse impact on the Company’s products, image and reputation. Legislation has been proposed in Congress and by certain state and local governments which would prohibit the sale of soft drink products in non-refillable bottles and cans or require a mandatory deposit as a means of encouraging the return of such containers, each in an attempt to reduce solid waste and litter. Similarly, the Company is aware of proposed legislation that would impose fees or taxes on various types of containers used in its business. The Company is not currently impacted by the policies in these types of proposed legislation, but it is possible that similar or more restrictive legal requirements may be proposed or enacted within its distribution territories in the future. Concerns about perceived negative safety and quality consequences of certain ingredients in the Company’s products, such as non-nutritive sweeteners could result in additional governmental regulations concerning the production, marketing, labeling or availability of the Company’s products or the ingredients in such products, possible new taxes or negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against the Company or other companies in the same industry, any of which could damage the reputation of the Company or reduce demand for the Company’s products, which could adversely affect the Company’s profitability. 11 The FDA occasionally proposes major changes to the nutrition labels required on all packaged foods and beverages, including those for most of the Company’s products, which could require the Company and its competitors to revise nutrition labels to include updated serving sizes, information about total calories in a beverage product container and information about any added sugars or nutrients. Any pervasive nutrition label changes could increase the Company’s costs and could inhibit sales of one or more of the Company’s major products. Most beverage products sold by the Company are classified as food or food products and are therefore eligible for purchase using SNAP benefits by consumers purchasing them for home consumption. Energy drinks with a nutrition facts label are also classified as food and are eligible for purchase for home consumption using SNAP benefits, whereas energy drinks classified as a supplement by the FDA are not. Regulators may restrict the use of benefit programs, including SNAP, to purchase certain beverages and foods currently classified as food or food products. Technology failures or cyberattacks on the Company’s technology systems or the Company’s effective response to technology failures or cyberattacks on its customers, suppliers or other third parties technology systems could disrupt the Company’s operations and negatively impact the Company’s reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. The Company increasingly relies on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information. Like most companies, the Company’s information technology systems may be vulnerable to interruption due to a variety of events beyond the Company’s control, including, but not limited to, power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, other malicious computer programs and cyberattacks, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, usage errors by employees and other security issues. In addition, third-party providers of data hosting or cloud services, as well as customers and suppliers, could experience cybersecurity incidents involving data the Company shares with them. The Company depends heavily upon the efficient operation of technological resources and a failure in these technology systems or controls could negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the Company continuously upgrades and updates current technology or installs new technology. In order to address risks to its technology systems, the Company continues to monitor networks and systems, upgrade security policies and train its employees, and it requires third-party service providers, customers, suppliers and other third parties to do the same. The inability to implement upgrades, updates or installations in a timely manner, to train employees effectively in the use of new or updated technology, or to obtain the anticipated benefits of the Company’s technology could adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or profitability. The Company has technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate its risk to these vulnerabilities; however, these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to ensure that the Company’s operations are not disrupted. If the Company’s technology systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly, it may incur significant financial and other resources to upgrade, repair or replace them, and the Company may suffer interruptions in its business operations, resulting in lost revenues and potential delays in reporting its financial results. Further, misuse, leakage or falsification of the Company’s information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations and damage the reputation and credibility of the Company. The Company may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to the Company, current or former employees, bottling partners, other customers, suppliers or consumers, and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight. The Company could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information technology systems, including liability for stolen information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation expense and increased insurance premiums. The Company relies on The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies to invest in the Company through marketing funding and to promote their own company brand identity through external advertising, marketing spending and product innovation. Decreases from historic levels of investment could negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations or profitability. The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies have historically provided financial support to the Company through marketing funding. While the Company does not believe there will be significant changes to the amount of marketing funding support provided by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies, the Company’s beverage agreements generally do not obligate such funding and there can be no assurance the historic levels will continue. Decreases in the level of marketing funding provided, material changes in the marketing funding programs’ performance requirements or the Company’s inability to meet the performance requirements for marketing funding could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations or profitability.12  In addition, The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies have their own external advertising campaigns, marketing spending and product innovation programs, which directly impact the Company’s operations. Decreases in marketing, advertising and product innovation spending by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies, or advertising campaigns that are negatively perceived by the public, could adversely impact the sales volume growth and profitability of the Company. While the Company does not believe there will be significant changes in the level of external advertising and marketing spending by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies, there can be no assurance the historic levels will continue or that advertising campaigns will be positively perceived by the public. The Company’s volume growth is also dependent on product innovation by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies, and their ability to develop and introduce products that meet consumer preferences. The Company is a participant in several Coca‑Cola system governance entities, and decisions made by these governance entities may be different than decisions that would have been made by the Company individually. Any failure of these governance entities to function efficiently or on the best behalf of the Company and any failure or delay of the Company to receive anticipated benefits from these governance entities could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company is a member of CONA and party to a master services agreement with CONA, pursuant to which the Company is an authorized user of the CONA System, a uniform information technology system developed to promote operational efficiency and uniformity among all North American Coca‑Cola bottlers. The Company relies on CONA to make necessary upgrades to and resolve ongoing or disaster-related technology issues with the CONA System, and it is limited in its authority and ability to timely resolve errors or to make changes to the CONA software. Any service interruptions of the CONA System could result in increased costs or adversely impact the Company’s results of operations. In addition, because other Coca‑Cola bottlers are also users of the CONA System and would likely experience similar service interruptions, the Company may not be able to have another bottler process orders on its behalf during any such interruption. The Company is also member of the NPSG, which consists of The Coca‑Cola Company, the Company and certain other Coca‑Cola bottlers. Pursuant to the NPSG Governance Agreement, the Company has agreed to abide by decisions made by the NPSG Board, which include decisions regarding strategic infrastructure investment and divestment planning, optimal national product supply sourcing and new product or packaging infrastructure planning. Although the Company has a representative on the NPSG Board, the Company cannot exercise sole decision-making authority relating to the decisions of the NPSG Board, and the interests of other members of the NPSG Board may diverge from those of the Company. Any such divergence could have a material adverse effect on the operating and financial results of the Company. Provisions in the CBA and the RMA with The Coca‑Cola Company could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or a sale of the Company’s Coca‑Cola distribution or manufacturing businesses. Provisions in the CBA and the RMA require the Company to obtain The Coca‑Cola Company’s prior approval of a potential buyer of the Company’s Coca‑Cola distribution or manufacturing businesses, which could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or the Company’s ability to sell such businesses. The Company can obtain a list of pre-approved third-party buyers from The Coca‑Cola Company annually. In addition, the Company can seek buyer-specific approval from The Coca‑Cola Company upon receipt of a third-party offer to purchase the Company or its Coca‑Cola related businesses. If a change in control or sale of one of our businesses is delayed or prevented by the provisions in the CBA and the RMA, the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected. The concentration of the Company’s capital stock ownership with the Harrison family limits other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters. Members of the Harrison family, including the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, J. Frank Harrison, III, beneficially own shares of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock representing approximately 86% of the total voting power of the Company’s outstanding common stock. In addition, three members of the Harrison family, including Mr. Harrison, serve on the Company’s Board of Directors. As a result, members of the Harrison family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over the Company’s management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by the Company’s stockholders. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control otherwise favored by the Company’s other stockholders and could depress the stock price or limit other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters, which could result in the Company making decisions that stockholders outside the Harrison family may not view as beneficial. 13 The Company’s financial condition can be impacted by the stability of the general economy. Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions or in the geographic markets in which the Company does business may have the temporary effect of reducing the demand for certain of the Company’s products. For example, economic forces may cause consumers to shift away from purchasing higher-margin products and packages sold through immediate consumption and other highly profitable channels. Adverse economic conditions could also increase the likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which would increase the risk of uncollectibility of certain accounts. Each of these factors could adversely affect the Company’s overall business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company’s capital structure, including its cash positions and borrowing capacity with banks or other financial institutions and financial markets, exposes it to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of the Company’s counterparties were to become insolvent or enter bankruptcy, the Company’s ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. Consequently, the Company’s access to capital may be diminished. Any such event of default or failure could negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in the Company’s top customer relationships and marketing strategies could impact sales volume and revenues. The Company faces concentration risks related to a few customers comprising a large portion of the Company’s annual sales volume and net revenue. The Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if revenue from one or more of these significant customers is materially reduced or if the cost of complying with the customers’ demands is significant. Additionally, if receivables from one or more of these significant customers become uncollectible, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted. The Company’s largest customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and The Kroger Company, accounted for approximately 31% of the Company’s 2019 bottle/can sales volume to retail customers and approximately 21% of the Company’s 2019 total net sales. These customers typically make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand and customer service performance and generally do not enter into long-term contracts. The Company faces risks related to maintaining the volume demanded on a short-term basis from these customers, which can also divert resources away from other customers. The loss of Wal‑Mart Stores, Inc. or The Kroger Company as a customer could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company. Further, the Company’s revenue is affected by promotion of the Company’s products by significant customers, such as in-store displays created by customers or the promotion of the Company’s products in customers’ periodic advertising. If the Company’s significant customers change the manner in which they market or promote the Company’s products, or if the marketing efforts by significant customers become ineffective, the Company’s sales volume and revenue could be adversely impacted. The Company may not be able to respond successfully to changes in the marketplace. The Company operates in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverage industry and faces strong competition from other general and specialty beverage companies. The Company’s response to continued and increased customer and competitor consolidations and marketplace competition may result in lower than expected net pricing of the Company’s products. The Company’s ability to gain or maintain the Company’s share of sales or gross margins may be limited by the actions of the Company’s competitors, which may have advantages in setting prices due to lower raw material costs. Competitive pressures in the markets in which the Company operates may cause channel and product mix to shift away from more profitable channels and packages. If the Company is unable to maintain or increase volume in higher-margin products and in packages sold through higher-margin channels, such as immediate consumption, pricing and gross margins could be adversely affected. Any related efforts by the Company to improve pricing and/or gross margin may result in lower than expected sales volume. In addition, the Company’s sales of finished goods to The Coca‑Cola Company and other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers are governed by the RMA, pursuant to which the prices, or certain elements of the formulas used to determine the prices, for such finished goods are unilaterally established by The Coca‑Cola Company from time to time. This limits the Company’s ability to adjust pricing in response to changes in the marketplace, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. 14 The Company’s inability to meet requirements under its beverage agreements could result in the loss of distribution and manufacturing rights. Under the CBA and the RMA, which authorize the Company to distribute and/or manufacture products of The Coca‑Cola Company, and pursuant to the Company’s distribution agreements with other beverage companies, the Company must satisfy various requirements, such as making minimum capital expenditures or maintaining certain performance rates. Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in the loss of distribution and manufacturing rights for the respective products under one or more of these beverage agreements. The occurrence of other events defined in these agreements could also result in the termination of one or more beverage agreements. The RMA also requires the Company to provide and sell covered beverages to other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers at prices established pursuant to the RMA. As the timing and quantity of such requests by other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers can be unpredictable, any failure by the Company to adequately plan for such demand could also constrain the Company’s supply chain network. Changes in the Company’s level of debt, borrowing costs and credit ratings could impact access to capital and credit markets, restrict the Company’s operating flexibility and limit the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing to fund future needs. As of December 29, 2019, the Company had $1.03 billion of debt outstanding. The Company’s level of debt requires a substantial portion of future cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest, which reduces funds available for other purposes. The Company’s debt level can negatively impact its operations by limiting the Company’s ability to, and/or increasing its cost to, access credit markets for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; increasing the Company’s vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions by limiting the Company’s ability to react to changing economic and business conditions; and exposing the Company to increased risk that the Company will not be able to refinance the principal amount of debt as it becomes due or that a significant decrease in cash flows from operations could make it difficult for the Company to meet its debt service requirements and to comply with financial covenants in its debt agreements. The Company’s acquisition related contingent consideration, revolving credit facility, term loan facility and pension and postretirement medical benefits are subject to changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase in the future, the Company’s borrowing costs could increase, which could negatively impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and limit the Company’s ability to spend in other areas of the business. Further, a decline in the interest rates used to discount the Company’s pension and postretirement medical liabilities could increase the cost of these benefits and the amount of the liabilities. In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will not require banks to submit rates for the London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) after 2021. The Company has identified its revolving credit facility as its only LIBOR-indexed financial instrument which extends after 2021. The use of alternative reference rates or other reforms could cause the interest rate calculated for our revolving credit facility to be materially different than expected. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of and mitigate the risk associated with the expected discontinuation of LIBOR on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In assessing the Company’s credit strength, credit rating agencies consider the Company’s capital structure, financial policies, consolidated balance sheet and other financial information, and may also consider financial information of other bottling and beverage companies. The Company’s credit ratings could be significantly impacted by the Company’s operating performance, changes in the methodologies used by rating agencies to assess the Company’s credit ratings, changes in The Coca‑Cola Company’s credit ratings and the rating agencies’ perception of the impact of credit market conditions on the Company’s current or future financial performance. Lower credit ratings could significantly increase the Company’s borrowing costs or adversely affect the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing at acceptable interest rates or to refinance existing debt. Failure to attract, train and retain qualified employees while controlling labor costs, and other labor issues could have an adverse effect on the Company’s reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations or profitability. The Company’s future growth and performance depend on its ability to attract, hire, train, develop, motivate and retain a highly skilled, diverse and properly credentialed workforce. The Company’s ability to meet its labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to many external factors, including competition for and availability of qualified personnel in a given market, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage laws, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment and labor laws or other workplace regulations. Any unplanned turnover or unsuccessful implementation of the Company’s succession plans could deplete the Company’s institutional knowledge base and erode its competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect the Company’s reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. 15 The Company uses various insurance structures to manage costs related to workers’ compensation, auto liability, medical and other insurable risks. These structures consist of retentions, deductibles, limits and a diverse group of insurers that serve to strategically finance, transfer and mitigate the financial impact of losses to the Company. Losses are accrued using assumptions and procedures followed in the insurance industry, then adjusted for company-specific history and expectations. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations. In addition, the Company’s profitability is substantially affected by the cost of pension retirement benefits, postretirement medical benefits and current employees’ medical benefits. Macro-economic factors beyond the Company’s control, including increases in healthcare costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities, could result in significant increases in these costs for the Company. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations. Failure to maintain productive relationships with our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, including failing to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Approximately 14% of the Company’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Any inability of the Company to renegotiate subsequent agreements with labor unions on satisfactory terms and conditions could result in work interruptions or stoppages, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s profitability. In addition, the terms and conditions of existing or renegotiated agreements could increase costs or otherwise affect the Company’s ability to fully implement operational changes to improve overall efficiency. Certain employees of the Company whose employment is covered under collective bargaining agreements participate in a multiemployer pension plan, the Employers-Teamsters Local Union Nos. 175 and 505 Pension Fund (the “Teamsters Plan”). Participating in the Teamsters Plan involves certain risks in addition to the risks associated with single employer plans, as contributed assets are pooled and may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer stops contributing to the Teamsters Plan, the unfunded obligations of the Teamsters Plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If the Company chooses to stop participating in the Teamsters Plan, the Company could be required to pay the Teamsters Plan a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the Teamsters Plan. Changes in the inputs used to calculate the Company’s acquisition related contingent consideration liability could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. The Company’s acquisition related contingent consideration liability, which totaled $446.7 million as of December 29, 2019, consists of the estimated amounts due to The Coca‑Cola Company as sub-bottling payments under the CBA over the remaining useful life of the related distribution rights, which is generally 40 years. Changes in business conditions or other events could materially change both the future cash flow projections and the discount rate used in the calculation of the fair value of contingent consideration under the CBA. These changes could materially impact the fair value of the related contingent consideration and the amount of noncash expense (or income) recorded each reporting period. Changes in tax laws, disagreements with tax authorities or additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. The Company is subject to income taxes within the United States. The Company’s annual income tax rate is based upon the Company’s income, federal tax laws and various state and local tax laws within the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Changes in federal, state or local income tax rates and/or tax laws could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial results. Excise or other taxes imposed on the sale of certain of the Company’s products by the federal government and certain state and local governments, particularly any taxes incorporated into shelf prices and passed along to consumers, could cause consumers to shift away from purchasing products of the Company, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business and financial results. In addition, an assessment of additional taxes resulting from audits of the Company’s tax filings could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability, cash flows and financial condition. 16 Litigation or legal proceedings could expose the Company to significant liabilities and damage the Company’s reputation. The Company is from time to time a party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, litigation claims and legal proceedings arising out of its advertising and marketing practices, product claims and labels, intellectual property and commercial disputes, and environmental and employment matters. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, the Company records reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Although the Company does not believe a material amount of loss in excess of recorded amounts is reasonably possible as a result of these claims, the Company faces risk of an adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows, depending on the outcome of the legal proceedings. Natural disasters, changing weather patterns and unfavorable weather could negatively impact the Company’s business, financial condition and future results of operations or profitability. Natural disasters or unfavorable weather conditions in the geographic regions in which the Company or its suppliers operate could have an adverse impact on the Company’s revenue and profitability. For instance, unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for the Company’s products and contribute to lower sales, which could adversely affect the Company’s profitability for such periods. Prolonged drought conditions could lead to restrictions on water use, which could adversely affect the Company’s cost and ability to manufacture and distribute products. Hurricanes or similar storms may have a negative sourcing impact or cause shifts in product mix to lower-margin products and packages. Climate change may have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations. There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could cause significant changes in weather patterns and an increase in the frequency or duration of extreme weather and climate events. These changes could adversely impact some of the Company’s facilities, the availability and cost of key raw materials used by the Company in production or the demand for the Company’s products. Public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require the Company to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. In addition, federal, state or local governmental authorities may propose legislative and regulatory initiatives in response to concerns over climate change which could directly or indirectly adversely affect the Company’s business, require additional investments or increase the cost of raw materials, fuel, ingredients and water. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on the Company’s business and results of operations. "
15,COKE,COCA-COLA BTLNG CONS,2019-02-27,"Risk Factors
 In addition to other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company’s business. The Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. 11 The Company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials, fuel and other supplies. Raw material costs, including the costs for plastic bottles, aluminum cans, resin and high fructose corn syrup, have historically been subject to significant price volatility and may continue to be in the future. International or domestic geopolitical or other events, including the imposition of any tariffs and/or quotas by the U.S. government on any of these raw materials, could adversely impact the supply and cost of these raw materials to the Company. In addition, there is no limit on the prices The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies can charge for concentrate. If the Company cannot offset higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, effective commodity price hedging, increased sales volume or reductions in other costs, the Company’s profitability could be adversely affected. In recent years, there has been consolidation among suppliers of certain of the Company’s raw materials, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to negotiate the lowest costs and, in light of the Company’s relatively low in-plant raw material inventory levels, has the potential for causing interruptions in the Company’s supply of raw materials and in its manufacture of finished goods. The Company purchases all its plastic bottles from Southeastern Container and Western Container, two manufacturing cooperatives the Company co-owns with several other Coca‑Cola bottlers, and all its aluminum cans from two domestic suppliers. The inability of these plastic bottle or aluminum can suppliers to meet the Company’s requirements for containers could result in the Company not being able to fulfill customer orders and production demand until alternative sources of supply are located. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate. Failure of the aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Company’s purchase requirements could negatively impact inventory levels, customer confidence and results of operations, including sales levels and profitability. The Company uses a combination of internal and external freight shipping and transportation services to transport and deliver products. The Company’s freight cost and the timely delivery of its products may be adversely impacted by a number of factors which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations, including driver shortages, reduced availability of independent contractor drivers, higher fuel costs, weather conditions, traffic congestion, increased government regulation and other matters. In addition, the Company uses significant amounts of fuel for its delivery fleet and other vehicles used in the distribution of its products. International or domestic geopolitical or other events could impact the supply and cost of fuel and could impact the timely delivery of the Company’s products to its customers. Although the Company strives to reduce fuel consumption and uses commodity hedges to manage the Company’s fuel costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting the impact of fuel price volatility on the Company’s business or future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations. The inability of the Company to successfully integrate the operations and employees acquired in the System Transformation into existing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, culture or results of operations. During 2017, the Company completed its System Transformation transactions, through which it acquired additional distribution territories and regional manufacturing facilities from CCR and United. Through these acquisitions and the additional resources needed to support the Company’s growth, the Company added approximately 10,000 employees and nearly 45 million additional customers over the four-year period of the System Transformation.  Although the System Transformation transactions were completed in 2017, the Company continues to face risk in its ability to continue to integrate the Company’s culture, information technology systems, production, distribution, sales and administrative support activities, internal controls over financial reporting, environmental compliance and health and safety compliance, procedures and policies across all its territories. The completed System Transformation transactions involve certain other financial and business risks. The Company may not realize a satisfactory return, including economic benefit and productivity levels, on the Company’s investments. In addition, the Company’s assumptions for potential growth, synergies or cost savings at the time of the distribution territory and regional manufacturing facilities acquisitions may prove to be incorrect. The occurrence of these events could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. 12 Changes in public and consumer perception and preferences or government regulations related to nonalcoholic beverages, including concerns or regulations related to obesity, public health, artificial ingredients and product safety, could reduce demand for the Company’s products and reduce profitability. The Company’s business depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. As the Company distributes, markets and manufactures beverage brands owned by others, the success of the Company’s business depends in large measure on working with The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies. The Company is reliant upon the ability of The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies to develop and introduce product innovations to meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market, and failure to satisfy these consumer preferences could adversely affect the profitability of the Company’s business. Health and wellness trends over the past several years have resulted in a shift in consumer preferences from sugar-sweetened sparkling beverages to diet sparkling beverages, tea, sports drinks, enhanced water and bottled water. Consumers, public health officials, public health advocates and government officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the public health consequences associated with obesity, particularly among young people. The production and marketing of beverages are subject to the rules and regulations of the FDA and other federal, state and local health agencies, and extensive changes in these rules and regulations could increase the Company’s costs or adversely impact its sales. The Company cannot predict whether any such rules or regulations will be enacted or, if enacted, the impact that such rules or regulations could have on its business. In response to the growing health, nutrition and obesity concerns of today’s youth, a number of states have regulations restricting the sale of soft drinks and other foods in schools, particularly elementary, middle and high schools. Many of these restrictions have existed for several years in connection with subsidized meal programs in schools. Restrictive legislation, if widely enacted, could have an adverse impact on our products, image and reputation. Most beverage products sold by the Company are classified as food or food products and are therefore eligible for purchase using supplemental nutrition assistance (“SNAP”) benefits by consumers purchasing them for home consumption. Energy drinks with a nutrition facts label are also classified as food and are eligible for purchase for home consumption using SNAP benefits, whereas energy drinks classified as a supplement by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) are not. Regulators may restrict the use of benefit programs, including SNAP, to purchase certain beverages and foods. Legislation has been proposed in Congress and by certain state and local governments which would prohibit the sale of soft drink products in non-refillable bottles and cans or require a mandatory deposit as a means of encouraging the return of such containers, each in an attempt to reduce solid waste and litter. Similarly, we are aware of legislation that would impose fees or taxes on various types of containers that are used in our business. We are currently not impacted by these types of proposed legislation, but it is possible that similar or more restrictive legal requirements may be proposed or enacted within our territories in the future. In addition, regulatory actions, activities by nongovernmental organizations and public debate and concerns about perceived negative safety and quality consequences of certain ingredients in the Company’s products, such as non-nutritive sweeteners, may erode consumers’ confidence in the safety and quality of the Company’s products, whether or not justified. These actions could result in additional governmental regulations concerning the production, marketing, labeling or availability of the Company’s products or the ingredients in such products, possible new taxes or negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against the Company or other companies in the same industry, any of which could damage the reputation of the Company or reduce demand for the Company’s products, which could adversely affect the Company’s profitability. The Company’s success also depends on its ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all its products. The Company has rigorous product safety and quality standards. However, if beverage products taken to market are or become contaminated or adulterated, the Company may be required to conduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which could cause its business and reputation to suffer. Technology failures or cyberattacks on the Company’s technology systems could disrupt the Company’s operations and negatively impact the Company’s reputation, business or results of operations. The Company depends heavily upon the efficient operation of technological resources and a failure in these technology systems or controls could negatively impact the Company’s operations, business or results of operations. In addition, the Company continuously upgrades and updates current technology or installs new technology. The inability to implement upgrades, updates or installations in a timely manner, to train employees effectively in the use of new or updated technology, or to obtain the anticipated benefits of the Company’s technology could adversely impact results of operations or profitability. 13 The Company increasingly relies on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information. For example, the Company’s manufacturing plants and distribution centers, inventory management and driver handheld devices all utilize information technology to maximize efficiencies and minimize costs. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communication between personnel, customers and suppliers depends on information technology. Like most companies, the Company’s information technology systems may be vulnerable to interruption due to a variety of events beyond the Company’s control, including, but not limited to, power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, other malicious computer programs and cyberattacks, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, usage errors by employees and other security issues. The Company has technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate its risk to these vulnerabilities, however these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to ensure that the Company’s operations are not disrupted. If the Company’s technology systems are damaged, breached, or cease to function properly, it may incur significant costs to repair or replace them, and the Company may suffer interruptions in operations, resulting in lost revenues and delays in reporting its financial results. Further, misuse, leakage or falsification of the Company’s information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations and damage the reputation and credibility of the Company. The Company may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to the Company, current or former employees, bottling partners, other customers, suppliers or consumers, and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight. The Company could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information technology systems, including liability for stolen information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation expense and increased insurance premiums. Any failure or delay of the Company to receive anticipated benefits from CONA could negatively impact the Company’s results of operations. The Company is a member of CONA and party to the CONA MSA, pursuant to which the Company is an authorized user of the CONA System, a uniform information technology system developed to promote operational efficiency and uniformity among all North American Coca‑Cola bottlers. Over the past two years, the Company has been transitioning its legacy technology system platform to the CONA System for its manufacturing plants, distribution centers and corporate headquarters using a phased cut-over process, and has now completed the transition of all locations to the CONA System. Although the Company believes the transition to the CONA System was successful and that it took the necessary steps before and during the transition to mitigate risk, including a comprehensive review of internal controls, extensive employee training, and additional verifications and testing to ensure data integrity, any service interruptions of the CONA System could result in increased costs or adversely impact the Company’s results of operations. In addition, because other Coca‑Cola bottlers are also users of the CONA System and would likely experience similar service interruptions, the Company may not be able to have another bottler process orders on its behalf during any such event. The Company relies on CONA to make necessary upgrades and resolve ongoing or disaster-related technology issues with the CONA System and is limited in its authority and ability to timely resolve errors or make changes to the CONA software. Significant additional labeling or warning requirements may increase costs and inhibit sales of affected products. The FDA occasionally proposes major changes to the nutrition labels required on all packaged foods and beverages, including those for most of the Company’s products. Any pervasive nutrition label changes could increase the Company’s costs and could inhibit sales of one or more of the Company’s major products. Certain nutrition label changes announced by the FDA in 2016, which were originally to become effective in 2018, have been delayed until 2020 or later. These proposed changes will require the Company and its competitors to revise nutrition labels to include updated serving sizes, information about total calories in a beverage product container and information about any added sugars or nutrients. The Company’s financial condition can be impacted by the stability of the general economy. Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions in the geographic markets in which the Company does business may have the temporary effect of reducing the demand for certain of the Company’s products. For example, economic forces may cause consumers to shift away from purchasing higher-margin products and packages sold through immediate consumption and other highly profitable channels. Adverse economic conditions could also increase the likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which would 14 increase the risk of uncollectibility of certain accounts. Each of these factors could adversely affect the Company’s overall financial condition and operating results. The Company’s capital structure, including its cash positions and debt borrowing capacity with banks or other financial institutions, exposes it to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of the Company’s counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, the Company’s ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings and the Company’s access to capital may be diminished. Any such event of default or failure could negatively impact the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Changes in the Company’s top customer relationships and marketing strategies could impact sales volume and revenues. The Company faces concentration risks related to a few customers comprising a large portion of the Company’s annual sales volume and net revenue. The Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected if revenue from one or more of these significant customers is materially reduced or if the cost of complying with the customers’ demands is significant. Additionally, if receivables from one or more of these significant customers become uncollectible, the Company’s results of operations may be adversely impacted. The Company’s largest customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and The Kroger Company accounted for approximately 30% of the Company’s 2018 bottle/can sales volume to retail customers and approximately 22% of the Company’s 2018 total net sales. These customers typically make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand and customer service performance and generally do not enter into long-term contracts. The Company faces risks related to maintaining the volume demanded on a short-term basis from these customers, which can also divert resources away from other customers. The loss of Wal‑Mart Stores, Inc. or The Kroger Company as a customer could have a material adverse effect on the operating and financial results of the Company. Further, the Company’s revenue is affected by promotion of the Company’s products by significant customers, such as in-store displays created by customers or the promotion of the Company’s products in customers’ periodic advertising. If the Company’s significant customers change the manner in which they market or promote the Company’s products, or if the marketing efforts by significant customers become ineffective, the Company’s sales volume and revenue could be adversely impacted. The Company may not be able to respond successfully to changes in the marketplace. The Company operates in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverage industry and faces strong competition from other general and specialty beverage companies. The Company’s response to continued and increased customer and competitor consolidations and marketplace competition may result in lower than expected net pricing of the Company’s products. The Company’s ability to gain or maintain the Company’s share of sales or gross margins may be limited by the actions of the Company’s competitors, which may have advantages in setting prices due to lower raw material costs. Competitive pressures in the markets in which the Company operates may cause channel and product mix to shift away from more profitable channels and packages. If the Company is unable to maintain or increase volume in higher-margin products and in packages sold through higher-margin channels such as immediate consumption, pricing and gross margins could be adversely affected. Any related efforts by the Company to improve pricing and/or gross margin may result in lower than expected sales volume. In addition, the Company’s sales of finished goods to CCNA and other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers are governed by the RMA, pursuant to which the prices, or certain elements of the formulas used to determine the prices, for such finished goods are unilaterally established by CCNA from time to time. This limits the Company’s ability to adjust pricing in response to changes in the marketplace, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability. The reliance on purchased finished products from external sources could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability. The Company does not, and does not plan to, manufacture all products it distributes and, therefore, remains reliant on purchased finished products from external sources to meet customer demand. As a result, the Company is subject to incremental risk including, but not limited to, product quality and availability, price variability and production capacity shortfalls for externally purchased finished products, which could have an impact on the Company’s profitability and customer relationships. In most instances, the Company’s ability to negotiate the prices at which it purchases finished products from other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers is limited pursuant to CCNA’s right to unilaterally establish the prices, or certain elements of the formulas used to determine the prices, for such finished products under the RMA, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability.15  The decisions made by the NPSG regarding product sourcing, product and packaging infrastructure and strategic investment and divestment may be different than decisions that would have been made by the Company individually. Any failure of the NPSG to function efficiently could adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations. The Company is a member of the NPSG, which consists of The Coca‑Cola Company, the Company and certain other Coca‑Cola bottlers which are regional producing bottlers in The Coca‑Cola Company’s national product supply system, each of which has representation on the NPSG Board. Pursuant to the NPSG Governance Agreement, the Company has agreed to abide by decisions made by the NPSG Board, which include decisions regarding strategic investment and divestment, optimal national product supply sourcing and new product or packaging infrastructure planning. Although the Company has a representative on the NPSG Board, the Company cannot exercise sole decision-making authority relating to the decisions of the NPSG Board, and the interests of other members of the NPSG Board may diverge from those of the Company. For example, the NPSG Board may require the Company to make investments in its manufacturing assets, subject to certain limitations and consistent with the NPSG Governance Agreement, which the Company would not have chosen to make on its own. Any such requirement could have a material adverse effect on the operating and financial results of the Company. Decreases from historic levels of marketing funding provided to the Company from The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies could reduce the Company’s profitability. The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies have historically provided financial support to the Company through marketing funding. While the Company does not believe there will be significant changes to the amount of marketing funding support provided by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies, the Company’s beverage agreements generally do not obligate such funding and there can be no assurance the historic levels will continue. Decreases in the level of marketing funding provided, material changes in the marketing funding programs’ performance requirements or the Company’s inability to meet the performance requirements for marketing funding could adversely affect the Company’s profitability. Changes in The Coca‑Cola Company’s and other beverage companies’ levels of external advertising, marketing spending and product innovation could reduce the Company’s sales volume. The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies have their own external advertising campaigns, marketing spending and product innovation programs, which directly impact the Company’s operations. Decreases in marketing, advertising and product innovation spending by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies, or advertising campaigns that are negatively perceived by the public, could adversely impact the sales volume growth and profitability of the Company. While the Company does not believe there will be significant changes in the level of external advertising and marketing spending by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies, there can be no assurance historic levels will continue or that advertising campaigns will be positively perceived by the public. The Company’s volume growth is also dependent on product innovation by The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies, and their ability to develop and introduce products that meet consumer preferences. The Company’s inability to meet requirements under its beverage agreements could result in the loss of distribution and manufacturing rights. Under the CBA and the RMA, which authorize the Company to distribute and/or manufacture products of The Coca‑Cola Company, and pursuant to the Company’s distribution agreements with other beverage companies, the Company must satisfy various requirements, such as making minimum capital expenditures or maintaining certain performance rates. Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in the loss of distribution and manufacturing rights for the respective products under one or more of these beverage agreements. The occurrence of other events defined in these agreements could also result in the termination of one or more beverage agreements. The RMA also requires the Company to provide and sell covered beverages to other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers at prices established pursuant to the RMA. As the timing and quantity of such requests by other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers can be unpredictable, any failure by the Company to adequately plan for such demand could also constrain the Company’s supply chain network. 16 Changes in the Company’s level of debt, borrowing costs and credit ratings could impact access to capital and credit markets, restrict the Company’s operating flexibility and limit the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing to fund future needs. As of December 30, 2018, the Company had $1.14 billion of debt and capital lease obligations. The Company’s level of debt requires a substantial portion of future cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest, which reduces funds available for other purposes. The Company’s debt level can negatively impact its operations by:  •limiting the Company’s ability to, and/or increasing its cost to, access credit markets for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; •increasing the Company’s vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions by limiting the Company’s ability to react to changing economic and business conditions; and •exposing the Company to increased risk that a significant decrease in cash flows from operations could make it difficult for the Company to meet its debt service requirements and to comply with financial covenants in its debt agreements. The Company’s acquisition related contingent consideration, revolving credit facility, term loan facility and pension and postretirement medical benefits are subject to changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase in the future, the Company’s borrowing costs could increase, which could result in a reduction of the Company’s overall profitability and limit the Company’s ability to spend in other areas. Further, a decline in the interest rates used to discount the Company’s pension and postretirement medical liabilities could increase the cost of these benefits and the amount of the liabilities. In assessing the Company’s credit strength, credit rating agencies consider the Company’s capital structure, financial policies, consolidated balance sheet and other financial information, and may also consider financial information of other bottling companies. The Company’s credit ratings could be significantly impacted by the Company’s operating performance, changes in the methodologies used by rating agencies to assess the Company’s credit ratings, changes in The Coca‑Cola Company’s credit ratings and the rating agencies’ perception of the impact of credit market conditions on the Company’s current or future financial performance. Lower credit ratings could significantly increase the Company’s borrowing costs or adversely affect the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing at acceptable interest rates or refinance existing debt. Failure to attract, train and retain qualified employees while controlling labor costs, and other labor issues, including a failure to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s profitability. The Company’s future growth and performance depend on its ability to attract, hire, train, develop, motivate and retain a highly skilled, diverse and properly credentialed workforce. The Company’s ability to meet its labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to many external factors, including competition for and availability of qualified personnel in a given market, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage laws, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment and labor laws or other workplace regulations. Any unplanned turnover or unsuccessful implementation of the Company’s succession plans could deplete the Company’s institutional knowledge base and erode its competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect the Company’s reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. The Company uses various insurance structures to manage costs related to workers’ compensation, auto liability, medical and other insurable risks. These structures consist of retentions, deductibles, limits and a diverse group of insurers that serve to strategically finance, transfer and mitigate the financial impact of losses to the Company. Losses are accrued using assumptions and procedures followed in the insurance industry, then adjusted for company-specific history and expectations. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations. In addition, the Company’s profitability is substantially affected by the cost of pension retirement benefits, postretirement medical benefits and current employees’ medical benefits. Macro-economic factors beyond the Company’s control, including increases in healthcare costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities, could result in significant increases in these costs for the Company. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations. Approximately 15% of the Company’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Any inability of the Company to renegotiate subsequent agreements with labor unions on satisfactory terms and conditions could result in work interruptions or stoppages, which could have a material impact on the Company’s profitability. In addition, the terms and conditions of existing or renegotiated agreements could increase costs or otherwise affect the Company’s ability to fully implement operational changes to improve overall efficiency.17  Changes in the inputs used to calculate the Company’s acquisition related contingent consideration liability could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial results. The Company’s acquisition related contingent consideration liability consists of the estimated amounts due to The Coca‑Cola Company as sub-bottling payments under the CBA over the remaining useful life of the related distribution rights, which is generally 40 years. Changes in business conditions or other events could materially change both the projection of future cash flows and the discount rate used in the calculation of the fair value of contingent consideration under the CBA. These changes could materially impact the fair value of the related contingent consideration and the amount of noncash expense (or income) recorded each reporting period. Changes in tax laws, disagreements with tax authorities or additional tax liabilities could have a material impact on the Company’s financial results. The Company is subject to income taxes within the United States. The Company’s annual income tax rate is based upon the Company’s income, federal tax laws and various state and local tax laws within the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Changes in federal, state or local income tax rates and/or tax laws could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial results. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) was signed into law and significantly reformed the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Shortly after the Tax Act was enacted, the SEC issued guidance under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to address the application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and direct taxpayers to consider the impact of the Tax Act as “provisional” when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for the change in tax law. Regulatory guidance or related interpretations of the Tax Act may continue to be issued by the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, changes in accounting standards, legislative actions and future actions by states within the U.S. may cause certain changes in the assumptions made by the Company related to the Tax Act. Excise or other taxes imposed on the sale of certain of the Company’s products by the federal government and certain state and local governments, particularly any taxes incorporated into shelf prices and passed along to consumers, could cause consumers to shift away from purchasing products of the Company, which could materially affect the Company’s business and financial results. In addition, an assessment of additional taxes resulting from audits of the Company’s tax filings could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability, cash flows and financial condition. Litigation or legal proceedings could expose the Company to significant liabilities and damage the Company’s reputation. The Company is from time to time a party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, litigation claims and legal proceedings arising out of its advertising and marketing practices, product claims and labels, intellectual property and commercial disputes, and environmental and employment matters. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, the Company records reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Although the Company does not believe a material amount of loss in excess of recorded amounts is reasonably possible as a result of these claims, the Company faces risk of an adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows, depending on the outcome of the legal proceedings. Natural disasters, changing weather patterns and unfavorable weather could negatively impact the Company’s future profitability. Natural disasters or unfavorable weather conditions in the geographic regions in which the Company or its suppliers operate could have an adverse impact on the Company’s revenue and profitability. For instance, unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for the Company’s products and contribute to lower sales, which could adversely affect the Company’s profitability for such periods. Prolonged drought conditions could lead to restrictions on water use, which could adversely affect the Company’s cost and ability to manufacture and distribute products. Hurricanes or similar storms may have a negative sourcing impact or cause shifts in product mix to lower-margin products and packages. Changing weather patterns, along with the increased frequency or duration of extreme weather and climate events, could impact some of the Company’s facilities or the availability and cost of key raw materials used by the Company in production. In addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency could directly or indirectly affect the Company’s production, distribution and packaging, and the cost of raw materials, fuel, ingredients and water, which could adversely impact the Company’s profitability.18  Provisions in the CBA and the RMA with The Coca‑Cola Company could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or a sale of the Company’s Coca‑Cola distribution or manufacturing businesses. Provisions in the CBA and the RMA require the Company to obtain The Coca‑Cola Company’s prior approval of a potential buyer of the Company’s Coca‑Cola distribution or manufacturing businesses, which could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or the Company’s ability to sell such businesses. The Company can obtain a list of approved third-party buyers from The Coca‑Cola Company annually. In addition, the Company can seek buyer-specific approval from The Coca‑Cola Company upon receipt of a third party offer to purchase the Company or its Coca‑Cola related businesses. The concentration of the Company’s capital stock ownership with the Harrison family limits other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters. Members of the Harrison family, including the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, J. Frank Harrison, III, beneficially own shares of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock representing approximately 86% of the total voting power of the Company’s outstanding capital stock. In addition, three members of the Harrison family, including Mr. Harrison, serve on the Company’s Board of Directors. As a result, members of the Harrison family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over the Company’s management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by the Company’s stockholders. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control otherwise favored by the Company’s other stockholders and could depress the stock price or limit other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters, which could result in the Company making decisions that stockholders outside the Harrison family may not view as beneficial. "
12,COKE,COCA-COLA BTLNG CONS,2018-02-28,"Risk Factors
 In addition to other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company’s business. The Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. The inability of the Company to successfully integrate the operations and employees acquired in the System Transformation into existing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, culture or results of operations. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company completed its System Transformation transactions, through which it acquired additional distribution territories and manufacturing facilities from CCR and United. Through these acquisitions and the additional resources needed to support the Company’s growth, the Company has grown from 6,700 employees serving 20.6 million customers in fiscal 2013 to 16,500 employees serving 65 million customers in 2017.  Although the System Transformation acquisitions are now complete, the Company continues to face risk in its ability to continue to integrate the Company’s culture, information technology systems, production, distribution, sales and administrative support activities, internal controls over financial reporting, environmental compliance and health and safety compliance, procedures and policies across all its territories. The completed System Transformation acquisitions involve certain other financial and business risks. The Company may not realize a satisfactory return, including economic benefit and productivity levels, on the Company’s investments. In addition, the Company’s assumptions for potential growth, synergies or cost savings at the time of the distribution territory and manufacturing facilities acquisitions may prove to be incorrect. The occurrence of these events could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Changes in public and consumer perception and preferences or government regulations related to nonalcoholic beverages, including concerns or regulations related to obesity, public health, artificial ingredients and product safety, could reduce demand for the Company’s products and reduce profitability. The Company’s business depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. As the Company distributes, markets and manufactures beverage brands owned by others, the success of the Company’s business depends in large measure on working with the Beverage Companies. The Company is reliant upon the ability of The Coca‑Cola Company and other Beverage Companies to develop and introduce product innovations to meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market, and failure to satisfy these consumer preferences could adversely affect the profitability of the Company’s business. Health and wellness trends over the past several years have resulted in a shift in consumer preferences from sugar sweetened sparkling beverages to diet sparkling beverages, tea, sports drinks, enhanced water and bottled water. Consumers, public health officials, public health advocates and government officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the public health consequences associated with obesity, particularly among young people. The production and marketing of beverages are subject to the rules and regulations of the FDA and other federal, state and local health agencies, and extensive changes in these rules and regulations could increase the Company’s costs or adversely impact its sales. The Company cannot predict whether any such rules or regulations will be enacted or, if enacted, the impact that such rules or regulations could have on its business. In addition, regulatory actions, activities by nongovernmental organizations and public debate and concerns about perceived negative safety and quality consequences of certain ingredients in the Company’s products, such as non-nutritive sweeteners, may erode consumers’ confidence in the safety and quality of the Company’s products, whether or not justified. These actions could result in additional governmental regulations concerning the production, marketing, labeling or availability of the Company’s products or the ingredients in such products, possible new taxes or negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against the Company or other companies in the same industry, any of which could damage the reputation of the Company or reduce demand for the Company’s products, which could adversely affect the Company’s profitability. The Company’s success also depends on its ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all its products. The Company has rigorous product safety and quality standards. However, if beverage products taken to market are or become contaminated or adulterated, the Company may be required to conduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which could cause its business and reputation to suffer. 15 The Company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials, fuel and other supplies. Raw material costs, including the costs for plastic bottles, aluminum cans, resin and high fructose corn syrup, have historically been subject to significant price volatility and may continue to be in the future. International or domestic geopolitical or other events, including the imposition of any tariffs and/or quotas by the U.S. government on any of these raw materials, could adversely impact the supply and cost of these raw materials to us. In addition, there is no limit on the prices The Coca‑Cola Company and other Beverage Companies can charge for concentrate. If the Company cannot offset higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, effective commodity price hedging, increased sales volume or reductions in other costs, the Company’s profitability could be adversely affected. In recent years, there has been consolidation among suppliers of certain of the Company’s raw materials, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to negotiate the lowest costs and, in light of the Company’s relatively low in-plant raw material inventory levels, has the potential for causing interruptions in the Company’s supply of raw materials and in its manufacture of finished goods. The Company purchases all of its plastic bottles from Southeastern Container and Western Container, two manufacturing cooperatives the Company co-owns with several other Coca‑Cola bottlers, and all of its aluminum cans from two domestic suppliers. The inability of these plastic bottle or aluminum can suppliers to meet the Company’s requirements for containers could result in the Company not being able to fulfill customer orders and production demand until alternative sources of supply are located. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate. Failure of the aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Company’s purchase requirements could negatively impact inventory levels, customer confidence and results of operations, including sales levels and profitability. The Company uses a combination of internal and external freight shipping and transportation services to transport and deliver products.  The Company’s freight cost and the timely delivery of our products may be adversely impacted by a number of factors which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations, including driver shortages, reduced availability of independent contractor drivers, higher fuel costs, weather conditions, traffic congestion, increased government regulation and other matters. In addition, the Company uses significant amounts of fuel for its delivery fleet and other vehicles used in the distribution of its products. International or domestic geopolitical or other events could impact the supply and cost of fuel and could impact the timely delivery of the Company’s products to its customers. Although the Company strives to reduce fuel consumption and uses commodity hedges to manage the Company’s fuel costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting the impact of fuel price volatility on the Company’s business or future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations. Technology failures or cyberattacks on the Company’s technology systems could disrupt the Company’s operations and negatively impact the Company’s reputation, business or results of operations. The Company depends heavily upon the efficient operation of technological resources and a failure in these technology systems or controls could negatively impact the Company’s operations, business or results of operations. In addition, the Company continuously upgrades and updates current technology or installs new technology. The inability to implement upgrades, updates or installations in a timely manner, to train employees effectively in the use of new or updated technology, or to obtain the anticipated benefits of the Company’s technology could adversely impact results of operations or profitability. The Company increasingly relies on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information. For example, the Company’s production and distribution facilities, inventory management and driver handheld devices all utilize information technology to maximize efficiencies and minimize costs. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communication between personnel, customers and suppliers depends on information technology. Like most companies, the Company’s information technology systems may be vulnerable to interruption due to a variety of events beyond the Company’s control, including, but not limited to, power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, other malicious computer programs and cyberattacks, denial-of-service attacks, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes, usage errors by employees and other security issues. The Company has technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate its risk to these vulnerabilities, however these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to ensure that the Company’s operations are not disrupted. If the Company’s technology systems are damaged, breached, or cease to function properly, it may incur significant costs to repair or replace them, and the Company may suffer interruptions in operations, resulting in lost revenues, and delays in reporting its financial results. 16  Further, misuse, leakage or falsification of the Company’s information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations and damage the reputation and credibility of the Company. The Company may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to the Company, current or former employees, bottling partners, other customers, suppliers or consumers, and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight. The Company could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information technology systems, including liability for stolen information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation expense and increased insurance premiums. Any failure or delay of the Company to transition to, and receive anticipated benefits from, the CONA System or the decisions made by the CONA Board could negatively impact the Company’s results of operations. The Company is a member of CONA and party to the CONA MSA, pursuant to which the Company is an authorized user of the CONA System, a uniform information technology system developed to promote operational efficiency and uniformity among all North American Coca‑Cola bottlers. The Company is continuing the process of transitioning its legacy technology system platform to the CONA System for its manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities and corporate headquarters. The Company anticipates completing the transition of all locations to the CONA System by the end of fiscal 2018. Although the Company believes it has taken the necessary steps to mitigate risk associated with a phased cut-over to the CONA System, including a comprehensive review of internal controls, extensive employee training, and additional verifications and testing to ensure data integrity, any service interruptions or delays in the Company’s transition to the CONA System could result in increased costs or adversely impact the Company’s results of operations. In addition, because other Coca‑Cola bottlers are also transitioning to the CONA System and would likely experience similar service interruptions or delays, the Company may not be able to have another bottler process orders on its behalf during any such event. The Company currently has the right to designate one of the members of the CONA Board and has a percentage interest in CONA of approximately 20% but cannot unilaterally control the actions of CONA or the CONA Board. The Company faces the risk that a software solution beneficial to the Company is not approved by the CONA Board, requiring the Company to invest additional time and financial resources in developing a solution outside the CONA System to meet its requirements, or that the CONA Board makes decisions regarding CONA or the CONA System which may be different than decisions the Company would have made on its own behalf. Further, the Company remains obligated to pay service fees under the CONA MSA even if it is not using the CONA System for all or any portion of its distribution and manufacturing operations. There is additional risk involved with the CONA System as the Company relies on CONA to make necessary upgrades and resolve ongoing or disaster-related technology issues with the CONA System and is limited in its authority and ability to timely resolve errors or make changes to the CONA software. Miscalculation of the Company’s need for infrastructure investment could impact the Company’s financial results. Significant changes from the Company’s expected returns on cold drink equipment, fleet, technology and supply chain infrastructure investments could adversely affect the Company’s consolidated financial results. Projected requirements for infrastructure investments may differ from actual levels if the Company does not achieve the sales volume growth it anticipates. The Company’s infrastructure investments are generally long-term in nature; therefore, it is possible the investments made today may not generate the returns expected by the Company as a result of future changes in the marketplace. In addition, the Company faces risk in determining the level of infrastructure investment needed in territories and facilities recently acquired in the System Transformation. Any failure of the Company to adequately forecast these infrastructure investment requirements could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations. Significant additional labeling or warning requirements may increase costs and inhibit sales of affected products. The FDA occasionally proposes major changes to the nutrition labels required on all packaged foods and beverages, including those for most of the Company’s products. Any pervasive nutrition label changes could increase the Company’s costs and could inhibit sales of one or more of the Company’s major products. Certain nutrition label changes announced by the FDA in 2016, which were originally to become effective in July 2018, have been delayed until 2020 or later. These proposed changes will require the Company and its competitors to revise nutrition labels to include updated serving sizes, information about total calories in a beverage product container and information about any added sugars or nutrients. 17 The Company’s financial condition can be impacted by the stability of the general economy. Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions in the geographic markets in which the Company does business may have the temporary effect of reducing the demand for certain of the Company’s products. For example, economic forces may cause consumers to shift away from purchasing higher-margin products and packages sold through immediate consumption and other highly profitable channels. Adverse economic conditions could also increase the likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which would increase the risk of uncollectibility of certain accounts. Each of these factors could adversely affect the Company’s overall financial condition and operating results. The Company’s capital structure, including its cash positions and debt borrowing capacity with banks or other financial institutions, exposes it to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of the Company’s counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, the Company’s ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings and the Company’s access to capital may be diminished. Any such event of default or failure could negatively impact the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Changes in the Company’s top customer relationships and marketing strategies could impact sales volume and revenues. The Company faces concentration risks related to a few customers comprising a large portion of the Company’s annual sales volume and net revenue. The Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected if revenue from one or more of these significant customers is materially reduced or if the cost of complying with the customers’ demands is significant. Additionally, if receivables from one or more of these significant customers become uncollectible, the Company’s results of operations may be adversely impacted. The Company’s largest customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., The Kroger Company and Food Lion, LLC, accounted for approximately 35% of the Company’s 2017 bottle/can sales volume to retail customers and approximately 24% of the Company’s 2017 total net sales. These customers typically make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand and customer service performance and generally do not enter into long-term contracts. The Company faces risks related to maintaining the volume demanded on a short-term basis from these customers, which can also divert resources away from other customers. The loss of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., The Kroger Company or Food Lion, LLC as a customer could have a material adverse effect on the operating and financial results of the Company. Further, the Company’s revenue is affected by promotion of the Company’s products by significant customers, such as in-store displays created by customers or the promotion of the Company’s products in customers’ periodic advertising. If the Company’s significant customers change the manner in which they market or promote the Company’s products, or if the marketing efforts by significant customers become ineffective, the Company’s sales volume and revenue could be adversely impacted. The Company may not be able to respond successfully to changes in the marketplace. The Company operates in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverage industry and faces strong competition from other general and specialty beverage companies. The Company’s response to continued and increased customer and competitor consolidations and marketplace competition may result in lower than expected net pricing of the Company’s products. The Company’s ability to gain or maintain the Company’s share of sales or gross margins may be limited by the actions of the Company’s competitors, which may have advantages in setting prices due to lower raw material costs. Competitive pressures in the markets in which the Company operates may cause channel and product mix to shift away from more profitable channels and packages. If the Company is unable to maintain or increase volume in higher-margin products and in packages sold through higher-margin channels such as immediate consumption, pricing and gross margins could be adversely affected. Any related efforts by the Company to improve pricing may result in lower than expected sales volume. In addition, the Company’s sales of finished goods to CCNA and other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers are governed by the RMA, pursuant to which the prices, or certain elements of the formulas used to determine the prices, for such finished goods are unilaterally established by CCNA from time to time, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability. The reliance on purchased finished goods from external sources could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability. The Company does not, and does not plan to, manufacture all products it distributes and, therefore, remains reliant on purchased finished goods from external sources to meet customer demand. As a result, the Company is subject to incremental risk including, but 18 not limited to, product quality and availability, price variability and production capacity shortfalls for externally purchased finished goods, which could have an impact on the Company’s profitability and customer relationships. In most instances, the Company’s ability to negotiate the prices at which it purchases finished goods from other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers is limited pursuant to CCNA’s right to unilaterally establish the prices, or certain elements of the formulas used to determine the prices, for such finished goods under the RMA, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability. The decisions made by the NPSG regarding product sourcing, product and packaging infrastructure and strategic investment and divestment may be different than decisions that would have been made by the Company individually. Any failure of the NPSG to function efficiently could adversely affect our business and results of operations. The Company is a member of the NPSG, which consists of The Coca‑Cola Company, the Company and other RPBs in The Coca‑Cola Company’s national product supply system, each of which has a representative on the NPSG Board. Pursuant to the NPSG Governance Agreement, the Company has agreed to abide by decisions made by the NPSG Board, which include decisions regarding strategic investment and divestment, optimal national product supply sourcing and new product or packaging infrastructure planning. Although the Company has a representative on the NPSG Board, the Company cannot exercise sole decision-making authority relating to the decisions of the NPSG Board, and the interests of other members of the NPSG Board may diverge from those of the Company. For example, the NPSG Board may require the Company to make investments in its manufacturing assets, subject to certain limitations and consistent with the NPSG Governance Agreement, which the Company would not have chosen to make on its own. Decreases from historic levels of marketing funding provided to the Company from The Coca‑Cola Company and other Beverage Companies could reduce the Company’s profitability. The Coca‑Cola Company and other Beverage Companies have historically provided financial support to the Company through marketing funding. In 2017, the Company received $120.1 million in marketing funding. While the Company does not believe there will be significant changes to the amount of marketing funding support by the Beverage Companies, there can be no assurance the historic levels will continue. Decreases in the level of marketing funding provided, material changes in the marketing funding programs’ performance requirements or the Company’s inability to meet the performance requirements for marketing funding could adversely affect the Company’s profitability. Changes in The Coca‑Cola Company’s and other Beverage Companies’ levels of external advertising, marketing spending and product innovation could reduce the Company’s sales volume. The Coca‑Cola Company and other Beverage Companies have their own external advertising campaigns, marketing spending and product innovation programs, which directly impact the Company’s operations. Decreases in marketing, advertising and product innovation spending by the Beverage Companies, or advertising campaigns that are negatively perceived by the public, could adversely impact the sales volume growth and profitability of the Company. While the Company does not believe there will be significant changes in the level of external advertising and marketing spending by the Beverage Companies, there can be no assurance historic levels will continue in the future. The Company’s volume growth is also dependent on product innovation by the Beverage Companies, especially The Coca‑Cola Company, and their ability to develop and introduce products that meet consumer preferences. The Company’s inability to meet requirements under its beverage agreements could result in the loss of distribution and manufacture rights. Approximately 93% of the Company’s bottle/can sales volume to retail customers in 2017 consisted of products of The Coca‑Cola Company, which is the sole supplier of these products or the concentrates and syrups required to manufacture these products. Under the CBA and the RMA, which authorize the Company to distribute and/or manufacture products of The Coca‑Cola Company, and pursuant to the Company’s distribution agreements with other Beverage Companies, the Company must satisfy various requirements, such as making minimum capital expenditures or maintaining certain performance rates. Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in the loss of distribution and manufacture rights for the respective products under one or more of these beverage agreements. The occurrence of other events defined in these agreements could also result in the termination of one or more beverage agreements. The RMA also requires the Company to provide and sell covered beverages to other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers at prices established pursuant to the RMA. As the timing and quantity of such requests by other U.S. Coca‑Cola bottlers can be unpredictable, any failure by the Company to adequately plan for such demand could also constrain the Company’s supply chain network. 19 Changes in the Company’s level of debt, borrowing costs and credit ratings could impact access to capital and credit markets, restrict the Company’s operating flexibility and limit the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing to fund future needs. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $1.13 billion of debt and capital lease obligations. The Company’s level of debt requires a substantial portion of future cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest, which reduces funds available for other purposes. The Company’s debt level can negatively impact its operations by:  •limiting the Company’s ability to, and/or increasing its cost to, access credit markets for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; •increasing the Company’s vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions by limiting the Company’s ability to react to changing economic and business conditions; and •exposing the Company to increased risk that a significant decrease in cash flows from operations could make it difficult for the Company to meet its debt service requirements and to comply with financial covenants in its debt agreements. The Company’s revolving credit facility, term loan facility and pension and postretirement medical benefits are subject to changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase in the future, the Company’s borrowing costs could increase, which could result in a reduction of the Company’s overall profitability and limit the Company’s ability to spend in other areas. Further, a decline in the interest rates used to discount the Company’s pension and postretirement medical liabilities could increase the cost of these benefits and increase the total liabilities. The Company’s credit ratings could be significantly impacted by the Company’s operating performance, changes in the methodologies used by rating agencies to assess the Company’s credit ratings and by changes in The Coca‑Cola Company’s credit ratings. Lower credit ratings could significantly increase the Company’s interest costs or adversely affect the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing at acceptable interest rates or refinance existing debt. Failure to attract, train and retain qualified employees while controlling labor costs, as well as other labor issues, including a failure to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s profitability. The Company’s future growth and performance depends on its ability to attract, hire, train, develop, motivate and retain a highly skilled, diverse and properly credentialed workforce. The Company’s ability to meet its labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to many external factors, including competition for and availability of qualified personnel in a given market, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage laws, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment and labor laws or other workplace regulations. Any unplanned turnover or unsuccessful implementation of the Company’s succession plans could deplete the Company’s institutional knowledge base and erode its competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect the Company’s reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. The Company uses various insurance structures to manage costs related to workers’ compensation, auto liability, medical and other insurable risks. These structures consist of retentions, deductibles, limits and a diverse group of insurers that serve to strategically transfer and mitigate the financial impact of losses. The Company uses commercial insurance as a risk reduction strategy to minimize catastrophic losses from claims. Losses are accrued using assumptions and procedures followed in the insurance industry, then adjusted for company-specific history and expectations. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations. In addition, the Company’s profitability is substantially affected by the cost of pension retirement benefits, postretirement medical benefits and current employees’ medical benefits. Macro-economic factors beyond the Company’s control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities could result in significant increases in these costs for the Company. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations. Approximately 14% of the Company’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Any inability by the Company to renegotiate subsequent agreements with labor unions on satisfactory terms and conditions could result in work interruptions or stoppages, which could have a material impact on the Company’s profitability. In addition, the terms and conditions of existing or renegotiated agreements could increase costs or otherwise affect the Company’s ability to fully implement operational changes to improve overall efficiency. 20 Changes in the inputs used to calculate the Company’s acquisition related contingent consideration liability could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial results. The Company’s acquisition related contingent consideration liability, which was $381.3 million as of December 31, 2017, consists of the estimated amounts due to The Coca‑Cola Company under the CBA over the remaining useful life of the related distribution rights. Changes in business conditions or other events could materially change both the projection of future cash flows and the discount rate used in the calculation of the fair value of contingent consideration under the CBA. These changes could materially impact the fair value of the related contingent consideration and could materially impact the amount of noncash expense (or income) recorded each reporting period. Changes in tax laws, disagreements with tax authorities or additional tax liabilities could have a material impact on the Company’s financial results. The Company is subject to income taxes within the United States. The Company’s annual income tax rate is based upon the Company’s income, federal tax laws and various state and local tax laws within the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Changes in federal, state or local income tax rates and changes in federal, state or local tax laws could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial results. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) was signed into law and significantly reformed the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Shortly after the Tax Act was enacted, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“SAB 118”) to address the application of GAAP and direct taxpayers to consider the impact of the Act as “provisional” when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for the change in tax law. In accordance with SAB 118, the Company has recognized the provisional tax impacts, outlined above, related to the re-measurement of its net deferred tax liability. The ultimate impact may differ from the provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, the significant complexity of the Tax Act, anticipated additional regulatory guidance or related interpretations that may be issued by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), changes in accounting standards, legislative actions, future actions by states within the U.S. and changes in estimate, analysis, interpretations and assumptions the Company has made. Excise or other taxes imposed on the sale of certain of the Company’s products by the federal government and certain state and local governments, particularly if the taxes were incorporated into shelf prices and passed along to consumers, could cause consumers to shift away from purchasing products of the Company, which could materially affect the Company’s business and financial results. In addition, an assessment of additional taxes resulting from audits of the Company’s tax filings could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability, cash flows and financial condition. Litigation or legal proceedings could expose the Company to significant liabilities and damage the Company’s reputation. The Company is from time to time a party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, litigation claims and legal proceedings arising out of its advertising and marketing practices, product claims and labels, intellectual property and commercial disputes, and environmental and employment matters. With respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, the Company records reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Although the Company does not believe a material amount of loss in excess of recorded amounts is reasonably possible as a result of these claims, the Company faces risk of an adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows, depending on the outcome of the legal proceedings. Natural disasters, changing weather patterns and unfavorable weather could negatively impact the Company’s future profitability. Natural disasters or unfavorable weather conditions in the geographic regions in which the Company or its suppliers operate could have an adverse impact on the Company’s revenue and profitability. For instance, unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for the Company’s products and contribute to lower sales, which could adversely affect the Company’s profitability for such periods. Prolonged drought conditions could lead to restrictions on water use, which could adversely affect the Company’s cost and ability to manufacture and distribute products. Hurricanes or similar storms may have a negative sourcing impact or cause shifts in product mix to lower-margin products and packages. Changing weather patterns, along with the increased frequency or duration of extreme weather and climate events, could impact some of the Company’s facilities or the availability and cost of key raw materials used by the Company in production. In addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency could directly or indirectly affect the 21 Company’s production, distribution and packaging, and the cost of raw materials, fuel, ingredients and water, which could adversely impact the Company’s profitability. Provisions in the CBA and the RMA with The Coca‑Cola Company could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company and a sale of the Company’s Coca‑Cola distribution or manufacturing businesses. Provisions in the CBA and the RMA require the Company to obtain The Coca‑Cola Company’s prior approval of a potential buyer of the Company’s Coca‑Cola distribution or manufacturing businesses, which could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or the Company’s ability to sell such businesses. The Company can obtain a list of approved third-party buyers from The Coca‑Cola Company annually. In addition, the Company can seek buyer-specific approval from The Coca‑Cola Company upon receipt of a third party offer to purchase the Company or its Coca‑Cola related businesses. The concentration of the Company’s capital stock ownership with the Harrison family limits other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters. Members of the Harrison family, including the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, J. Frank Harrison, III, beneficially own shares of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock representing approximately 86% of the total voting power of the Company’s outstanding capital stock. In addition, three members of the Harrison family, including Mr. Harrison, serve on the Company’s Board of Directors. As a result, members of the Harrison family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over the Company’s management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by the Company’s stockholders. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control otherwise favored by the Company’s other stockholders and could depress the stock price or limit other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters, which could result in the Company making decisions that stockholders outside the Harrison family may not view as beneficial. "
3,COKE,COCA-COLA BTLNG CONS,2017-03-14,"Risk Factors
 In addition to other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company’s business. The Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. The inability of the Company to successfully integrate the operations and employees acquired in the Expansion Transactions and in any future Expansion Transactions into existing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, culture or results of operations. The Company is engaged in a multi-year series of transactions through which it is acquiring distribution territories and manufacturing facilities from Coca‑Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (“CCR”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Coca‑Cola Company. Through these acquisitions and additional resources needed to support the Company’s growth, the number of employees has grown to more than 13,100 as of January 1, 2017 from 6,500 as of February 1, 2013. There are many risks faced by the Company as it continues to acquire new workforces in new geographic areas. The Company must comply with local laws, including employment laws, for the new geographic areas in which it is expanding its business. The Company must ensure it has proper staffing with the availability and knowledge to support the volume of acquired employees and transactions. Also, the Company must devote resources to communicate its culture and to integrate new employees from previous employers’ culture to the Company’s culture. The inability to support the volume of employees and the inability to successfully integrate employees to one common culture could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business. The Company faces additional risk in its ability to successfully combine the Company’s existing business with the acquired distribution territories and manufacturing facilities. It must integrate production, distribution, sales and administrative support activities and information technology systems between the Legacy Territories and the Expansion Territories. It must also conform standards, controls, including internal controls over financial reporting, environmental compliance and health and safety compliance, procedures and policies between the Legacy Territories and the Expansion Territories. The completed Expansion Transactions and any future expansion transactions involve certain other financial and business risks. The Company may not realize a satisfactory return, including economic benefit and productivity levels, on the Company’s investment. The Company’s assumptions for potential growth, synergies or cost savings at the time of the Expansion Transactions may prove to be incorrect. Also, the Expansion Transactions could divert the attention of key members of the Company’s management and other available resources from its existing business in the Legacy Territories and previously acquired Expansion Territories. Sustained increases in the costs of labor and employment matters, for current, future and retired employees, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s profitability. The Company uses various insurance structures to manage costs related to workers’ compensation, auto liability, medical and other insurable risks. These structures consist of retentions, deductibles, limits and a diverse group of insurers that serve to strategically transfer and mitigate the financial impact of losses. The Company uses commercial insurance as a risk reduction strategy to minimize catastrophic losses from claims. Losses are accrued using assumptions and procedures followed in the insurance industry, then adjusted for company-specific history and expectations. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations. The Company’s profitability is substantially affected by the cost of pension retirement benefits, postretirement medical benefits and current employees’ medical benefits. Macro-economic factors beyond the Company’s control, including increases in health care costs, 17 declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities could result in significant increases in these costs for the Company. Also, the acquisition of Expansion Territories and employees, including integrating programs in the Expansion Territories, requires additional costs and resources. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations. As the Company’s workforce grows, it faces additional risk for employment-related claims and assessments. In addition, workplace safety programs must be expanded to cover a larger workforce. Miscalculation of the Company’s need for infrastructure investment could impact the Company’s financial results in both the Company’s Legacy and Expansion Territories and any future expansion territories. Significant changes from the Company’s expected returns on cold drink equipment, fleet, technology and supply chain infrastructure investments could adversely affect the Company’s consolidated financial results. Projected requirements of the Company’s infrastructure investments in the Company’s Legacy Territories, Expansion Territories and any future expansion territories may differ from actual levels if the Company’s volume growth is not as the Company anticipates. The Company’s infrastructure investments are generally long-term in nature; therefore, it is possible the investments made today may not generate the returns expected by the Company as a result of future changes in the marketplace. Technology failures or cyberattacks on the Company’s systems could disrupt the Company’s operations and negatively impact the Company’s business. The Company depends heavily upon the efficient operation of technological resources. A failure in information technology systems or controls could negatively impact operations. In addition, the Company continuously upgrades and updates current technology or installs new technology. The inability to implement upgrades, updates, or installations in a timely manner, to train employees effectively in the use of technology, or to obtain the anticipated benefits of the Company’s technology could adversely impact results of operations or profitability. The Company is a member of CONA Services LLC (“CONA”) and party to a Master Services Agreement with CONA, pursuant to which the Company is an authorized user of the Coke One North America system (the “CONA System”), which is a uniform information technology system developed to promote operational efficiency and uniformity among all North American Coca‑Cola bottlers. The Company is in process of transitioning Legacy Territories and Expansion Territories to the CONA System. The Company believes it has taken the necessary steps to mitigate risk associated with a phased cut-over to the CONA System, including a comprehensive review of internal controls, extensive employee training, and additional verifications and testing to ensure data integrity. There is additional risk involved with the CONA System as the Company relies on The Coca‑Cola Company to resolve technology issues and is limited in its authority and ability to resolve errors or make changes to the software. The Company increasingly relies on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information. For example, the Company’s production and distribution facilities, inventory management and driver handheld devices all utilize information technology to maximize efficiencies and minimize costs. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communication between personnel, customers and suppliers depends on information technology. Like most companies, the Company’s information technology systems may be vulnerable to interruption due to a variety of events beyond the Company’s control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. The Company may also experience difficulties integrating systems from Expansion Territories with those in its Legacy Territories. The Company has technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate the Company’s risk to these vulnerabilities, however these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to ensure that the Company’s operations are not disrupted. Changes in public and consumer preferences related to nonalcoholic beverages, including concerns related to obesity and health concerns, as well as perception of artificial ingredients, could reduce demand for the Company’s products and reduce profitability. The Company’s business depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of the Company’s business depends in large measure on working with the Beverage Companies, and the Company is reliant upon The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies’ product innovations to meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market. Failure to satisfy changing consumer preferences could adversely affect the profitability of the Company’s business. The Company’s success also depends in large part on its ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all its products. The Company has rigorous product safety and quality standards. However, if beverage products taken to market are or 18 become contaminated or adulterated, the Company may be required to conduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which would cause its business to suffer. Health and wellness trends over the past several years have resulted in a shift from sugar sparkling beverages to diet sparkling beverages, tea, sports drinks, enhanced water and bottled water. Consumers, public health officials, public health advocates and government officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the public health consequences associated with obesity, particularly among young people. The production and marketing of beverages are subject to the rules and regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and other federal, state and local health agencies.  In addition, regulatory actions, activities by nongovernmental organizations and public debate and concerns about perceived negative safety and quality consequences of certain ingredients in the Company’s products, such as non-nutritive sweeteners, may erode consumers’ confidence in the safety and quality of the Company’s products, whether or not justified, and could result in additional governmental regulations concerning the production, marketing, labeling or availability of the Company’s products, possible new taxes or negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against the Company or other companies in the same industry, all of which could damage the reputation of the Company’s products and may reduce demand for the Company’s products, which could adversely affect the Company’s profitability. Changes in the Company’s top customer relationships and marketing strategies could impact volume and revenues. The Company faces concentration risks related to a few customers comprising a large portion of the Company’s annual sales volume and net revenue. The Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected if revenue from one or more of these significant customers is significantly reduced or if the cost of complying with the customers’ demands is significant. Additionally, if receivables from one or more of these significant customers become uncollectible, the Company’s results of operations may be adversely impacted. The Company’s largest customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Food Lion, LLC and The Kroger Company accounted for approximately 34% of the Company’s 2016 bottle/can volume to retail customers and approximately 24% of the Company’s 2016 total net sales. These customers typically make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand and customer service performance and generally do not enter into long-term contracts. The Company faces risks to maintain the volume demanded on a short-term basis from these customers, which can also divert resources away from other customers. The loss of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Food Lion, LLC or The Kroger Company as a customer could have a material adverse effect on the operating and financial results of the Company. The Company’s revenue is affected by promotion of the Company’s products by significant customers, such as the customers creating in-store displays or promoting the Company’s products in their weekly circulars. If the Company’s significant customers change the manner in which they market or promote the Company’s products, or if the marketing efforts by significant customers become ineffective, the Company’s volume and revenue could be adversely impacted. The Company may not be able to respond successfully to changes in the marketplace. The Company operates in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverage industry and faces strong competition from other general and specialty beverage companies. The Company’s response to continued and increased customer and competitor consolidations and marketplace competition may result in lower than expected net pricing of the Company’s products. The Company’s ability to gain or maintain the Company’s share of sales or gross margins may be limited by the actions of the Company’s competitors, which may have advantages in setting prices due to lower raw material costs. Competitive pressures in the markets in which the Company operates may cause channel and product mix to shift away from more profitable channels and packages. If the Company is unable to maintain or increase volume in higher-margin products and in packages sold through higher-margin channels such as immediate consumption, pricing and gross margins could be adversely affected. The Company’s efforts to improve pricing may result in lower than expected sales volume. The Company’s financial condition can be impacted by the stability of the general economy. Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the geographic markets in which the Company does business, may have the temporary effect of reducing the demand for certain of the Company’s products. For example, economic forces may cause consumers to shift away from purchasing higher-margin products and packages sold through immediate consumption and other highly profitable channels. Adverse economic conditions could also increase the likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which would increase the risk of uncollectibility of certain accounts. Each of these factors could adversely affect the Company’s overall financial condition and operating results. 19 The Company’s capital structure, including its cash positions and debt borrowing capacity with banks or other financial institutions, exposes it to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of the Company’s counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, the Company’s ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty's liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. The Company’s results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by an event of default by or failure of one or more of its counterparties. The Company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials and other supplies. In recent years, there has been consolidation among suppliers of certain of the Company’s raw materials, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to negotiate the lowest costs and, in light of the Company’s relatively small in-plant raw material inventory levels, has the potential for causing interruptions in the Company’s supply of raw materials. The Company currently obtains all aluminum cans from two domestic suppliers and all plastic bottles from two domestic cooperatives. The inability of these aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Company’s requirements for containers could result in the Company not being able to fulfill customer orders and production demand until alternative sources of supply are located. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate. Failure of the aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Company’s purchase requirements could negatively impact inventory levels, customer confidence and results of operations, including sales levels and profitability. Raw material costs, including the costs for plastic bottles, aluminum cans and high fructose corn syrup, have historically been subject to significant price volatility and may continue to be in the future. In addition, there are no limits on the prices The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies can charge for concentrate. If the Company cannot offset higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, effective commodity price hedging, increased sales volume or reductions in other costs, the Company’s profitability could be adversely affected. The reliance on purchased finished goods from external sources could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability. The Company does not manufacture and does not plan to manufacture all products it distributes and, therefore, remains reliant on purchased finished goods from external sources. As a result, the Company is subject to incremental risk including, but not limited to, product quality and availability, price variability and production capacity shortfalls for externally purchased finished goods, which could have an impact on the Company’s profitability. The decisions made by the National Product Supply Group (the “NPSG”) may be different than decisions that would have been made by the Company individually. The NPSG was created in October 2015, and consists of The Coca‑Cola Company, the Company and other RPBs in The Coca‑Cola Company’s national product supply system. The Coca‑Cola Company and each member RPB has a representative on the governing board (the “NPSG Board”). As of January 2017, the NPSG Board consisted of The Coca‑Cola‑Company, the Company and five other RPBs, including CCR. Pursuant to the NPSG Governance Agreement, the Company has agreed to abide by decisions made by the NPSG Board, which include decisions regarding strategic investment and divestment, optimal national product supply sourcing and new product or packaging infrastructure planning. Even though the Company has a representative on the NPSG Board, the Company will not exercise sole decision-making authority relating to the decisions of the NPSG Board, and the interests of other members of the NPSG Board may diverge from those of the Company and may require the Company to make investments in its manufacturing assets consistent with the NPSG Governance Agreement. Decreases from historic levels of marketing funding provided to the Company from The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies could reduce the Company’s profitability. The Coca‑Cola Company and other beverage companies have historically provided financial support to the Company through marketing funding. In 2016, the Company received $99.4 million in marketing funding. While the Company does not believe there will be significant changes to the amount of marketing funding support by the beverage companies, there can be no assurance the historic levels will continue. Material changes in the marketing funding programs’ performance requirements, decreases in the level of marketing funding provided or the Company’s inability to meet the performance requirements for marketing funding could adversely affect the Company’s profitability. 20 Changes in The Coca-Cola Company’s and other beverage companies’ levels of external advertising, marketing spending and product innovation could reduce the Company’s sales volume. The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies have their own external advertising campaigns, marketing spending and product innovation programs, which directly impact the Company’s operations. Decreases in marketing, advertising and product innovation spending by the Beverage Companies, or Beverage Company campaigns that are negatively perceived by the public, could adversely impact the volume growth and profitability of the Company. While the Company does not believe there will be significant changes in the level of external advertising and marketing spending by the Beverage Companies, there can be no assurance historic levels will continue. The Company’s volume growth is also dependent on product innovation by the Beverage Companies, especially The Coca-Cola Company. The Company’s inability to meet requirements under its beverage agreements could result in the loss of distribution rights. Approximately 90% of the Company’s bottle/can volume to retail customers in 2016 consisted of products of The Coca‑Cola Company, which is the sole supplier of these products or the concentrates and syrups required to manufacture these products. The Company enters into CBAs and other beverage agreements with The Coca‑Cola Company, which authorize the Company to produce and/or distribute the covered beverages defined in these beverage agreements. The Company must satisfy various requirements under its beverage agreements and failure to satisfy these requirements could result in the loss of distribution rights for the respective products under one or more of these beverage agreements. The occurrence of other events defined in these agreements could also result in the termination of one or more beverage agreements. Changes in the Company’s level of debt, borrowing costs and credit ratings could impact access to capital and credit markets, restrict the Company’s operating flexibility and limit the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing to fund future needs. As of January 1, 2017, the Company had $956.0 million of debt and capital lease obligations. The Company’s level of debt requires a substantial portion of future cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest, which reduces funds available for other purposes. The Company’s debt level can negatively impact the Company’s operations by:  •Limiting the Company’s ability and/or increasing the cost to obtain funding for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including funding the cash purchase price of future territory expansions;  •Increasing the Company’s vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions by limiting the Company’s ability to react to changing economic and business conditions; and  •Exposing the Company to a risk that a significant decrease in cash flows from operations could make it difficult for the Company to meet its debt service requirements and to comply with financial covenants in its debt agreements. The Company’s Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan Facility and pension and postretirement medical benefits are subject to changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase in the future, the Company’s borrowing cost could increase, which could result in a reduction of the Company’s overall profitability and limit the Company’s ability to spend in other areas. A decline in interest rates used to discount the Company’s pension and postretirement medical liabilities could increase the cost of these benefits and increase the overall liability. The Company’s credit rating could be significantly impacted by changes in the methodologies used by rating agencies to assess the Company’s credit rating and by changes in the credit ratings of The Coca‑Cola Company. A lower credit rating could significantly increase the Company’s interest costs or could have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing at acceptable interest rates or to refinance existing debt. Changes in the inputs used to calculate the Company’s acquisition related contingent consideration liability could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial results. The acquisition related contingent consideration liability, which was $253.4 million as of January 1, 2017, consists of the estimated amounts due to The Coca‑Cola Company under the CBAs over the remaining useful life of the related distribution rights. Changes in business conditions or other events could materially change both the projection of future cash flows and the discount rate used in the calculation of the fair value of contingent consideration under the CBAs. These changes could materially impact the fair value of the related contingent consideration and could materially impact the amount of noncash expense (or income) recorded each reporting period. 21 Changes in tax laws, disagreements with tax authorities or additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial results. The Company is subject to income taxes within the United States. The Company’s annual income tax rate is based upon the Company’s income and the federal tax laws and the various state and local tax laws within the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Increases in federal, state or local income tax rates and changes in federal, state or local tax laws could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial results. Excise or other taxes imposed on the sale of certain of the Company’s products by the federal government and certain state and local governments, particularly if the taxes were incorporated into shelf prices and passed along to consumers, could cause consumers to shift away from purchasing products of the Company, which could materially affect the Company’s business and financial results. In addition, an assessment of additional taxes resulting from audits of the Company’s tax filings could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability, cash flows and financial condition. Issues surrounding labor relations could adversely impact the Company’s future profitability and/or its operating efficiency. Approximately 9% of the Company’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The inability to renegotiate subsequent agreements on satisfactory terms and conditions could result in work interruptions or stoppages, which could have a material impact on the profitability of the Company. Also, the terms and conditions of existing or renegotiated agreements could increase costs or otherwise affect the Company’s ability to fully implement operational changes to improve overall efficiency. In addition, as the Company has acquired the Expansion Territories, it has become engaged with new and different labor unions than those with which it has historically interacted. Terms and conditions of the new labor union agreements could result in delays of closings for new Expansion Territories and also increases the Company’s exposure to work interruptions or stoppages, as an increased percentage of its workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements. Natural disasters, changing weather patterns and unfavorable weather could negatively impact the Company’s future profitability. Natural disasters or unfavorable weather conditions in the geographic regions in which the Company operates could have an adverse impact on the Company’s revenue and profitability. For instance, unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for the Company’s products and contribute to lower sales, which could adversely affect the Company’s profitability for such periods. Prolonged drought conditions could lead to restrictions on water use, which could adversely affect the Company’s cost and ability to manufacture and distribute products. Changing weather patterns, along with the increased frequency or duration of extreme weather and climate events could impact some of the Company’s facilities or the availability and cost of key raw materials used by the Company in production. In addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency could directly or indirectly affect the Company’s production, distribution and packaging, the cost of raw materials, fuel, ingredients and water, which would impact the Company’s profitability. Increases in fuel prices or the inability of the Company to secure adequate supplies of fuel could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability. The Company uses significant amounts of fuel for its delivery fleet and other vehicles used in the distribution of its products. International or domestic geopolitical or other events could impact the supply and cost of fuel and could impact the timely delivery of the Company’s products to its customers. Although the Company strives to reduce fuel consumption and uses commodity hedges to manage the Company’s fuel costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting the impact of fuel price volatility on the Company’s business or future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations. Significant additional labeling or warning requirements may inhibit sales of affected products. The FDA occasionally proposes major changes to the nutrition labels required on all packaged foods and beverages, including those for most of the Company’s products. If the proposed changes are adopted, the Company and its competitors will be required to overhaul nutrition labels, including updating serving sizes, information about total calories in a beverage product container and information about any added sugars or nutrients. Pervasive nutrition label changes could increase the Company’s costs and could inhibit sales of one or more of the Company’s major products. 22 Provisions in the Final CBA and the Final RMA with The Coca‑Cola Company could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company.  Provisions in the Final CBA and the Final RMA require the Company to obtain The Coca‑Cola Company’s prior approval of a potential buyer of the Company’s Coca‑Cola distribution or manufacturing related businesses, which could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or the ability of the Company to sell such businesses. The Company can obtain a list of approved third-party buyers from The Coca‑Cola Company annually. In addition, the Company can seek buyer-specific approval from The Coca‑Cola Company upon receipt of a third party offer to purchase the Company or its Coca‑Cola related business. The concentration of the Company’s capital stock ownership with the Harrison family limits other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters. Members of the Harrison family, including the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, J. Frank Harrison, III, beneficially own shares of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock representing approximately 86% of the total voting power of the Company’s outstanding capital stock. In addition, three members of the Harrison family, including Mr. Harrison, serve on the Board of Directors of the Company. As a result, members of the Harrison family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over the Company’s management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by the Company’s stockholders. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control otherwise favored by the Company’s other stockholders and could depress the stock price and limits other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters, which could result in the Company making decisions that stockholders outside the Harrison family may not view as beneficial. "
6,COKE,COCA-COLA BTLNG CONS,2016-03-18,"Risk Factors
In addition to other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company’s business. The Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.The Company may not be able to respond successfully to changes in the marketplace.The Company operates in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverage industry and faces strong competition from other general and specialty beverage companies. The Company’s response to continued and increased customer and competitor consolidations and marketplace competition may result in lower than expected net pricing of the Company’s products. The Company’s ability to gain or maintain the Company’s share of sales or gross margins may be limited by the actions of the Company’s competitors, which may have advantages in setting their prices due to lower raw material costs. Competitive pressures in the markets in which the Company operates may cause channel and product mix to shift away from more profitable channels and packages. If the Company is unable to maintain or increase volume in higher-margin products and in packages sold through higher-margin channels (e.g., immediate consumption), pricing and gross margins could be adversely affected. The Company’s efforts to improve pricing may result in lower than expected sales volume.14Changes in how significant customers market or promote the Company’s products could reduce revenue.The Company’s revenue is affected by how significant customers market or promote the Company’s products. If the Company’s significant customers change the manner in which they market or promote the Company’s products, the Company’s revenue and profitability could be adversely impacted.Changes in the Company’s top customer relationships could impact revenues and profitability.The Company is exposed to risks resulting from several large customers that account for a significant portion of its bottle/can volume and revenue. The Company’s two largest customers accounted for approximately 29% of the Company’s 2015 bottle/can volume to retail customers and approximately 20% of the Company’s total net sales. The loss of one or both of these customers could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations. These customers typically make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand and customer service performance and generally do not enter into long-term contracts. In addition, these significant customers may re-evaluate or refine their business practices related to inventories, product displays, logistics or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. The Company’s results of operations could be adversely affected if revenue from one or more of these customers is significantly reduced or if the cost of complying with these customers’ demands is significant. If receivables from one or more of these customers become uncollectible, the Company’s results of operations may be adversely impacted.Changes in public and consumer preferences related to nonalcoholic beverages could reduce demand for the Company’s products and reduce profitability.The Company’s business depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of the Company’s business depends in large measure on working with the Beverage Companies to meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market. Health and wellness trends throughout the marketplace have resulted in a shift from sugar sparkling beverages to diet sparkling beverages, tea, sports drinks, enhanced water and bottled water over the past several years. Failure to satisfy changing consumer preferences, particularly those of young people, could adversely affect the profitability of the Company’s business.The Company’s sales can be impacted by the health and stability of the general economy.Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the geographic markets in which the Company does business, may have the temporary effect of reducing the demand for certain of the Company’s products. For example, economic forces may cause consumers to shift away from purchasing higher-margin products and packages sold through immediate consumption and other highly profitable channels. Adverse economic conditions could also increase the likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which would increase the risk of uncollectibility of certain accounts. Each of these factors could adversely affect the Company’s revenue, price realization, gross margins and overall financial condition and operating results.The inability of the Company to successfully integrate the operations acquired in the Expansion Transactions and in any future Expansion Transactions into the Company’s existing operations and implement the new contractual arrangements for the Expansion Transactions could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.The Company faces several potential risks relative to the Expansion Transactions including, without limitation, the Company’s ability to successfully combine the Company’s existing business with the distribution territories and manufacturing facilities acquired in the Expansion Transactions, including integrating production, distribution, sales and administrative support activities and information technology systems between the Company’s Legacy Territory operations and the operations acquired in the Expansion Transactions; and the Company’s ability to successfully operate in the Expansion Territories and to operate the Expansion Manufacturing Facilities.  Other risks involve motivating, recruiting and retaining key employees; conforming standards, controls (including internal control over financial reporting, environmental compliance and health and safety compliance), procedures and policies and business cultures between the Company and the operations acquired in the Expansion Transactions; growing business with existing customers and attracting new customers; and other unanticipated problems and liabilities. The completed Expansion Transactions and any future expansion transactions also involve certain other financial and business risks, including that the Company might not realize a satisfactory return on the Company’s investment, that the Company’s assumptions regarding potential growth, synergies or cost savings could turn out to have been incorrect, or that the transactions divert key members of the Company’s management’s attention and other available resources from its existing business in the Legacy Territories.15Miscalculation of the Company’s need for infrastructure investment could impact the Company’s financial results in both the Company’s Legacy and Expansion Territories and any future expansion territories.Projected requirements of the Company’s infrastructure investments in both the Company’s Legacy and Expansion Territories and any future expansion territories may differ from actual levels if the Company’s volume growth is not as the Company anticipates. The Company’s infrastructure investments are generally long-term in nature; therefore, it is possible that investments made today may not generate the returns expected by the Company due to future changes in the marketplace. Significant changes from the Company’s expected returns on cold drink equipment, fleet, technology and supply chain infrastructure investments could adversely affect the Company’s consolidated financial results.The Company’s inability to meet requirements under its beverage agreements could result in the loss of distribution rights.Approximately 87% of the Company’s bottle/can volume to retail customers in 2015 consisted of products of The Coca-Cola Company, which is the sole supplier of these products or of the concentrates or syrups required to manufacture these products. The remaining 13% of the Company’s bottle/can volume to retail customers in 2015 consisted of products of other beverage companies. The Company must satisfy various requirements under its beverage agreements, including the new CBAs for the Expansion Territories, which include additional obligations the Company must perform. Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in the loss of distribution rights for the respective products under one or more of these beverage agreements. The occurrence of other events defined in these agreements could also result in the termination of one or more beverage agreements.Changes in the inputs used to calculate the Company’s acquisition related contingent consideration liability could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial results. The acquisition related contingent consideration liability consists of the estimated amounts due to The Coca-Cola Company under the Comprehensive Beverage Agreements over the remaining useful life of the related distribution rights intangible assets.  Changes in business conditions or other events could materially change both the projections of future cash flows and the discount rate used in the calculation of the fair value of contingent consideration under the Comprehensive Beverage Agreements.  These changes could materially impact the fair value of the related contingent consideration and could materially impact the amount of noncash expense (or income) recorded each reporting period.Decreases from historic levels of marketing funding support could reduce the Company’s profitability.Material changes in the performance requirements, or decreases in the levels of marketing funding support historically provided, under marketing programs with The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies, or the Company’s inability to meet the performance requirements for the anticipated levels of such marketing funding support payments, could adversely affect the Company’s profitability. While the Company does not believe there will be significant changes in the levels of marketing funding support by the Beverage Companies, there can be no assurance that historic levels will continue.Changes in The Coca-Cola Company’s and other beverage companies’ levels of advertising, marketing spending and product innovation could reduce the Company’s sales volume.The Coca-Cola Company’s and other beverage companies’ levels of advertising, marketing spending and product innovation directly impact the Company’s operations. While the Company does not believe there will be significant changes in the levels of marketing and advertising by the Beverage Companies, there can be no assurance that historic levels will continue. The Company’s volume growth will also continue to be dependent on product innovation by the Beverage Companies, especially The Coca-Cola Company. Decreases in marketing, advertising and product innovation by the Beverage Companies could adversely impact the profitability of the Company.The inability of the Company’s aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Company’s purchase requirements could reduce the Company’s profitability.The Company currently obtains all of its aluminum cans from two domestic suppliers and all of its plastic bottles from two domestic cooperatives. The inability of these aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Company’s requirements for containers could result in short-term shortages until alternative sources of supply can be located. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate. Failure of the aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Company’s purchase requirements could reduce the Company’s profitability.16The inability of the Company to offset higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, increased bottle/can volume or reduced expenses could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability.Raw material costs, including the costs for plastic bottles, aluminum cans and high fructose corn syrup, have been subject to significant price volatility in the past and may continue to be in the future. In addition, there are no limits on the prices The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies can charge for concentrate. If the Company cannot offset higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, increased sales volume or reductions in other costs, the Company’s profitability could be adversely affected.The consolidation among suppliers of certain of the Company’s raw materials could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability.In recent years, there has been consolidation among suppliers of certain of the Company’s raw materials. The reduction in the number of competitive sources of supply could have an adverse effect upon the Company’s ability to negotiate the lowest costs and, in light of the Company’s relatively small in-plant raw material inventory levels, has the potential for causing interruptions in the Company’s supply of raw materials.The reliance on purchased finished goods from external sources makes the Company subject to incremental risks that could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability.Although the Company has purchased manufacturing assets and plans to continue to purchase additional manufacturing assets in the future, the Company remains reliant on purchased finished goods from external sources versus the Company’s internal production. As a result, the Company is subject to incremental risk including, but not limited to, product availability, price variability, and product quality and production capacity shortfalls for externally purchased finished goods. The Company’s operations in the Expansion Territories are more exposed to this risk than the Company’s operations in the Legacy Territories because, with exceptions under which the Company may produce finished goods itself and for exceptions relating to Expansion Manufacturing Facilities acquired by the Company that have served the Expansion Territories, the Company is required under the CBAs for the Expansion Territories to purchase finished goods from CCR and other authorized external sources in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Finished Goods Supply Agreement entered into by the Company at the closing of each Expansion Territory transaction in quantities required to satisfy fully the demand for beverages and related products the Company is authorized under the CBAs to distribute in the Expansion Territory.The Company’s participation in the National Product Supply Group (the “NPSG”) may create additional risk because we will not exercise sole decision making authority over national product supply system issues that affect the Company and other members of the NPSG Board may have different interests than we do.                                                                                                                                                                           Pursuant to the NPSG Governance Agreement, the Company has agreed to abide by decisions made by the NPSG governing board (the “NPSG Board”) that are made in accordance with the governance processes and principles outlined in the NPSG Governance Charter that is part of the NPSG Agreement.   Even though the Company will be a member of the NPSG Board, the Company will not exercise sole decision-making authority relating to the decisions of the NPSG Board, and the interests of other members of the NPSG Board may diverge from those of the Company.  These may include decisions made to benefit the Coca-Cola system as a whole but have a negative impact on the Company’s profitability, including decisions regarding strategic investment and divestment, optimal national product supply sourcing and new product or packaging infrastructure planning. Increases in fuel prices or the inability of the Company to secure adequate supplies of fuel could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability.The Company uses significant amounts of fuel in the distribution of its products. International or domestic geopolitical or other events could impact the supply and cost of fuel and could impact the timely delivery of the Company’s products to its customers. While the Company is working to reduce fuel consumption and manage the Company’s fuel costs, there can be no assurance that the Company will succeed in limiting the impact on the Company’s business or future cost increases. The Company may use derivative instruments to hedge some or all of the Company’s projected diesel fuel and gasoline purchases. These derivative instruments relate to fuel used in the Company’s delivery fleet and other vehicles. Sustained upward pressure in these costs could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations.Sustained increases in workers’ compensation, employment practices and vehicle accident claims costs could reduce the Company’s profitability.The Company uses various insurance structures to manage its workers’ compensation, auto liability, medical and other insurable risks. These structures consist of retentions, deductibles, limits and a diverse group of insurers that serve to strategically transfer and mitigate the financial impact of losses. The Company uses commercial insurance for claims as a risk reduction strategy to minimize 17catastrophic losses. Losses are accrued using assumptions and procedures followed in the insurance industry, adjusted for company-specific history and expectations. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases. Continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations.Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce the Company’s profitability.The Company’s profitability is substantially affected by the cost of pension retirement benefits, postretirement medical benefits and current employees’ medical benefits. In recent years, the Company has experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond the Company’s control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce the profitability of the Company’s operations.Product safety and quality concerns, including concerns related to perceived artificiality of ingredients, could negatively affect the Company’s business.The Company’s success depends in large part on its ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all its products. The Company has rigorous product safety and quality standards. However, if beverage products taken to market are or become contaminated or adulterated, the Company may be required to conduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which would cause its business to suffer. In addition, regulatory actions, activities by nongovernmental organizations and public debate and concerns about perceived negative safety and quality consequences of certain ingredients in the Company’s products, such as non-nutritive sweeteners, may erode consumers’ confidence in the safety and quality issues, whether or not justified, and could result in additional governmental regulations concerning the marketing and labeling of the Company’s products, negative publicity, or actual or threatened legal actions, all of which could damage the reputation of the Company’s products and may reduce demand for the Company’s products.Cybersecurity risks - technology failures or cyberattacks on the Company’s systems could disrupt the Company’s operations and negatively impact the Company’s business.The Company increasingly relies on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information. For example, the Company’s production and distribution facilities, inventory management and driver handheld devices all utilize information technology to maximize efficiencies and minimize costs. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communication between personnel, customers and suppliers depends on information technology. Like most companies, the Company’s information technology systems may be vulnerable to interruption due to a variety of events beyond the Company’s control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. The Company may also experience difficulties integrating systems from Expansion Territories with those in its Legacy Territories. The Company has technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate the Company’s risk to these vulnerabilities, but these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to ensure that the Company’s operations are not disrupted.Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the profitability of the Company.As of February 28, 2016, only the Company’s $450 million revolving credit facility was subject to changes in short-term interest rates. On February 28, 2016, the Company had $75.0 million outstanding borrowings on the $450 million revolving credit facility. If interest rates increase in the future, the Company’s borrowing cost could increase, which could result in a reduction of the Company’s overall profitability. The Company’s pension and postretirement medical benefits costs are also subject to changes in interest rates. A decline in interest rates used to discount the Company’s pension and postretirement medical liabilities could increase the cost of these benefits and increase the overall liability.The level of the Company’s debt could restrict the Company’s operating flexibility and limit the Company’s ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs.As of February 28, 2016, the Company had $753.6 million of debt and capital lease obligations. The Company’s level of debt requires the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of the Company’s future cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest, thereby reducing the funds available to the Company for other purposes. The Company’s debt can negatively impact the Company’s operations by (1) limiting the Company’s ability and/or increasing the cost to obtain funding for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purpose, including funding the cash purchase price of future territory expansions; (2) increasing the Company’s vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions by limiting the Company’s ability to react to changing economic and business conditions; and (3) exposing the Company to a risk that a significant decrease in cash flows from operations could make it difficult for the Company to meet the Company’s debt service requirements.18The Company’s credit ratings could be negatively impacted by changes to The Coca-Cola Company’s credit ratings.The Company’s credit rating could be significantly impacted by capital management activities of The Coca-Cola Company and/or changes in the credit ratings of The Coca-Cola Company. A lower credit rating could significantly increase the Company’s interest costs or could have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing at acceptable interest rates or to refinance existing debt.Changes in legal contingencies could adversely impact the Company’s future profitability.Changes from expectations for the resolution of outstanding legal claims and assessments could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s profitability and financial condition. In addition, the Company’s failure to abide by laws, orders or other legal commitments could subject the Company to fines, penalties or other damages.Legislative changes that affect the Company’s distribution, packaging and products could reduce demand for the Company’s products or increase the Company’s costs.The Company’s business model is dependent on the availability of the Company’s various products and packages in multiple channels and locations to better satisfy the needs of the Company’s customers and consumers. Laws that restrict the Company’s ability to distribute products in schools and other venues, as well as laws that require deposits for certain types of packages or those that limit the Company’s ability to design new packages or market certain packages, could negatively impact the financial results of the Company.In addition, excise or other taxes imposed on the sale of certain of the Company’s products by the federal government and certain state and local governments could cause consumers to shift away from purchasing products of the Company. If enacted, such taxes could materially affect the Company’s business and financial results, particularly if they were enacted in a form that incorporated them into the shelf prices for the Company’s products.Significant additional labeling or warning requirements may inhibit sales of affected products.In 2014 and again in 2015, the FDA proposed major changes to the nutrition labels required on all packaged foods and beverages, including those for most of the Company’s products. If the proposed changes are adopted, the Company and its competitors will be required to make nutrition label updates, which include updating serving sizes, including information about total calories in a beverage product container and providing information about any added sugars or nutrients. If the pending FDA nutrition label changes proposed become final, they will increase the Company’s costs and could inhibit sales of one or more of the Company’s major products. The timeline for implementation of any final regulations adopted by the FDA regarding changes to required nutrition labels is currently expected to be a period of up to two years.Changes in income tax laws and increases in income tax rates could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial results.The Company is subject to income taxes within the United States. The Company’s annual income tax rate is based upon the Company’s income and the federal tax laws and the various state tax laws within the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Increases in federal or state income tax rates and changes in federal or state tax laws could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial results.Additional taxes resulting from tax audits could adversely impact the Company’s future profitability.An assessment of additional taxes resulting from audits of the Company’s tax filings could have an adverse impact on the Company’s profitability, cash flows and financial condition.Natural disasters and unfavorable weather could negatively impact the Company’s future profitability.Natural disasters or unfavorable weather conditions in the geographic regions in which the Company does business could have an adverse impact on the Company’s revenue and profitability. Unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for the Company’s products and contribute to lower sales, which could adversely affect the Company’s profitability for such periods. Prolonged drought conditions in the geographic regions in which the Company does business could lead to restrictions on the use of water, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to manufacture and distribute products and the Company’s cost to do so.19Global climate change or legal, regulatory, or market responses to such change could adversely impact the Company’s future profitability.There is some scientific sentiment that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) in the atmosphere may have been the dominant cause of observed warming of the earth’s climate system since the mid-20th century, and that continued emission of GHGs could cause further warming and long-lasting changes in components of the global climate system, potentially increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems. Changing weather patterns, along with the increased frequency or duration of extreme weather and climate events, such as an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events, could impact some of the Company’s facilities and the availability or increase the cost of key raw materials that the Company uses to produce its products. In addition, the sale of the Company’s products can be impacted by weather conditions and climate events.Growing concern over the effects of climate change, including warming of the global climate system, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting GHG emissions. For example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has proposed regulations under the Clean Air Act to reduce GHG emissions from existing coal-fired power plants that would require each state to submit a plan specifying how it would reduce GHG emissions from existing coal-fired power plants located within its borders. It is anticipated that when the states implement their plans they could lead to the eventual closing of many of these plants. These USEPA proposed regulations or future laws enacted or regulations adopted to limit GHG emissions that directly or indirectly affect the Company’s production, distribution, packaging, cost of raw materials, fuel, ingredients and water could all impact the Company’s business and financial results.Issues surrounding labor relations could adversely impact the Company’s future profitability and/or its operating efficiency.Approximately 5% of the Company’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The inability to renegotiate subsequent agreements on satisfactory terms and conditions could result in work interruptions or stoppages, which could have a material impact on the profitability of the Company. Also, the terms and conditions of existing or renegotiated agreements could increase costs, or otherwise affect the Company’s ability to fully implement operational changes to improve overall efficiency. One collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 25 of the Company’s employees expired during 2015 and the Company entered into new agreements in 2015. Three collective bargaining agreement covering approximately 65 of the Company’s employees will expire during 2016.The Company’s ability to change distribution methods and business practices could be negatively affected by Coca-Cola bottler system disputes within the United States.Litigation filed by some U.S. bottlers of Coca-Cola products indicates that disagreements may exist within the Coca-Cola bottler system concerning distribution methods and business practices. Although the litigation has been resolved, disagreements among various Coca-Cola bottlers could adversely affect the Company’s ability to fully implement its business plans in the future.Obesity and other health concerns may reduce demand for some of the Company’s products.Consumers, public health officials, public health advocates and government officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the public health consequences associated with obesity, particularly among young people. The production and marketing of beverages are subject to the rules and regulations of the FDA and other federal, state and local health agencies. The FDA also regulates the labeling of containers under The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990. The Nutrition Facts label has not changed significantly since it was first introduced in 1994. In March 2014 and again in July 2015, the FDA proposed new rules that would result in major changes to nutrition labels on all food packages, including the packaging for the Company’s products, that would, among other things, require those labels to display caloric counts in large type, reflect larger portion sizes and display on a separate line on the label the amount of sugars that are added to the product. If these proposed rules are adopted by the FDA, the Company expects to have up to two years to put the required labeling changes into effect on the packaging for the products it manufactures and distributes. In addition, some researchers, health advocates and dietary guidelines are encouraging consumers to reduce the consumption of sugar, including sugar sparkling beverages. Increasing public concern about these issues, possible new taxes and governmental regulations concerning the production, marketing, labeling or availability of the Company’s beverages, and negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against the Company or other companies in the same industry relating to the marketing, labeling or sale of sugar sparkling beverages may reduce demand for these beverages, which could adversely affect the Company’s profitability.The Company has experienced public policy challenges regarding the sale of soft drinks in schools, particularly elementary, middle and high schools.A number of states have regulations restricting the sale of soft drinks and other foods in schools. Many of these restrictions have existed for several years in connection with subsidized meal programs in schools. The focus has more recently turned to the growing 20health, nutrition and obesity concerns of today’s youth. The impact of restrictive legislation, if widely enacted, could have an adverse impact on the Company’s products, image and reputation.If the financing of any future territory or other acquisitions involves issuing additional equity securities, their issuance would be dilutive and could affect the market price of the Company’s Common Stock.Acquisitions of the distribution and manufacturing assets of CCR in the Expansion Transactions completed to date have been financed with available cash, public debt issuance, or by draws on our revolving credit facility. The Company may fund any future distribution, manufacturing or other acquisition transactions through the use of existing cash, cash equivalents or investments, debt financing, including draws on the Company’s revolving credit facility, the issuance of equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing. Any future acquisitions of additional distribution, manufacturing or other assets that are financed in whole or in part by issuing additional shares of the Company’s Common Stock would be dilutive, which could affect the market price of our Common Stock. Provisions in the Final CBA and the Final RMA with The Coca-Cola Company could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, which could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock. Provisions in the Final CBA and the Final RMA require the Company to obtain The Coca-Cola Company’s prior approval of a potential buyer of the Company’s Coca-Cola distribution or manufacturing related businesses, which could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or the ability of the Company to sell such businesses. The Company annually can obtain a list of approved third party buyers from The Coca-Cola Company or, upon receipt of a third party offer to purchase the Company or its Coca-Cola related business, may seek approval of such buyer by The Coca-Cola Company. In addition, the Final CBA and the Final RMA contain a sale process provision that would apply if the Company notifies The Coca-Cola Company that it wishes to sell the distribution or manufacturing business to The Coca-Cola Company, which process includes default terms and conditions of sale and a third party valuation should the Company and The Coca-Cola Company choose to use them. The Final CBA and the Final RMA also include terms that would apply in the event The Coca-Cola Company terminates the Final CBA or the Final RMA following the Company’s default thereunder.The concentration of the Company’s capital stock ownership with the Harrison family limits other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters.Members of the Harrison family, including the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, J. Frank Harrison, III, beneficially own shares of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock representing approximately 86% of the total voting power of the Company’s outstanding capital stock. In addition, three members of the Harrison family, including Mr. Harrison, serve on the Board of Directors of the Company. As a result, members of the Harrison family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over the Company’s management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by the Company’s stockholders. Additionally, as a result of the Harrison family’s significant beneficial ownership of the Company’s outstanding voting stock, the Company has relied on the “controlled company” exemption from certain corporate governance requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control otherwise favored by the Company’s other stockholders and could depress the stock price. It also limits other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, the Company may take actions that the Company’s other stockholders may not view as beneficial.  "
2,COKE,COCA-COLA BTLNG CONS,2015-03-13,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
  In addition to other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Companys business. The Companys business, financial condition orresults of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.  The Company may not be able torespond successfully to changes in the marketplace.  The Company operates in the highly competitive nonalcoholicbeverage industry and faces strong competition from other general and specialty beverage companies. The Companys response to continued and increased customer and competitor consolidations and marketplace competition may result in lower thanexpected net pricing of the Companys products. The Companys ability to gain or maintain the Companys share of sales or gross margins may be limited by the actions of the Companys competitors, which may have advantages insetting their prices due to lower raw material costs. Competitive pressures in the markets in which the Company operates may cause channel and product mix to shift away from more profitable channels and packages. If the Company is unable to maintainor increase volume in higher-margin products and in packages sold through higher-margin channels (e.g., immediate consumption), pricing and gross margins could be adversely affected. The Companys efforts to improve pricing may result in lowerthan expected sales volume.  Changes in how significant customers market or promote the Companys products couldreduce revenue.  The Companys revenue is affected by how significant customers market or promote theCompanys products. Revenue has been negatively impacted by less aggressive price promotion by some retailers in the future consumption channels over the past several years. If the Companys significant customers change the manner in whichthey market or promote the Companys products, the Companys revenue and profitability could be adversely impacted. Changes in the Companys top customer relationships could impact revenues and profitability. The Company is exposed to risks resulting from several large customers that account for a significant portion of its bottle/can volume andrevenue. The Companys two largest customers accounted for approximately 31% of the Companys 2014 bottle/can volume to retail customers and approximately 21% of the Companys total net sales. The loss of one or both of thesecustomers could adversely affect the Companys results of operations. These customers typically make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand and customer service performance and generally do notenter into long-term contracts. In addition, these significant customers may re-evaluate or refine their business practices related to inventories, product displays, logistics or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. TheCompanys results of operations could be adversely affected if revenue from one or more of these customers is significantly reduced or if the cost of complying with these customers demands is significant. If receivables from one or moreof these customers become uncollectible, the Companys results of operations may be adversely impacted.  Changes inpublic and consumer preferences related to nonalcoholic beverages could reduce demand for the Companys products and reduce profitability.  The Companys business depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of the Companys business depends in large measure on workingwith the Beverage Companies to meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market. Health and wellness trends throughout the marketplace have resulted in a shift from sugar sparkling beverages to diet sparkling beverages, tea, sports drinks,enhanced water and bottled water over the past several years. Failure to satisfy changing consumer preferences, particularly those of young people, could adversely affect the profitability of the Companys business. The Companys sales can be impacted by the health and stability of the general economy. Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the geographic markets in which theCompany does business, may have the temporary effect of reducing the demand   15 Table of Contentsfor certain of the Companys products. For example, economic forces may cause consumers to shift away from purchasing higher-margin products and packages sold through immediate consumptionand other highly profitable channels. Adverse economic conditions could also increase the likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which would increase the risk of uncollectibility of certain accounts. Each of these factors couldadversely affect the Companys revenue, price realization, gross margins and overall financial condition and operating results.  The inability of the Company to successfully integrate the operations of the Expansion Territories and any future expansion territories into the Companys existing operations and implement thenew contractual arrangements for the Expansion Territories could adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations.  The following pose potential risks relative to the Expansion Territories: the Companys ability to successfully combine the Companys business with the Expansion Territories, includingintegrating distribution, sales and administrative support activities and information technology systems between the Companys Legacy Territories and the Expansion Territories; and the Companys ability to successfully operate in theExpansion Territories: motivating, recruiting and retaining key employees; conforming standards, controls (including internal control over financial reporting, environmental compliance and health and safety compliance), procedures and policies andbusiness cultures between the Company and the Expansion Territories; growing business with existing customers and attracting new customers; and other unanticipated problems and liabilities. The territory expansion transactions the Company hasrecently completed and any future expansion transactions also involve certain other financial and business risks, including that the Company might not realize a satisfactory return on the Companys investment, that the Companysassumptions regarding potential growth, synergies or cost savings could turn out to have been incorrect, or that the territory expansions divert key members of the Companys managements attention and the Companys other availableresources from our existing business in the Legacy Territories.  Miscalculation of the Companys need forinfrastructure investment could impact the Companys financial results in both the Companys Legacy and Expansion Territories and any future expansion territories. Projected requirements of the Companys infrastructure investments in both the Companys Legacy and Expansion Territories andany future expansion territories may differ from actual levels if the Companys volume growth is not as the Company anticipates. The Companys infrastructure investments are generally long-term in nature; therefore, it is possible thatinvestments made today may not generate the returns expected by the Company due to future changes in the marketplace. Significant changes from the Companys expected returns on cold drink equipment, fleet, technology and supply chaininfrastructure investments could adversely affect the Companys consolidated financial results.  The Companysinability to meet requirements under its beverage agreements could result in the loss of distribution rights. Approximately 88% of the Companys bottle/can volume to retail customers in 2014 consisted of products of The Coca-Cola Company,which is the sole supplier of these products or of the concentrates or syrups required to manufacture these products. The remaining 12% of the Companys bottle/can volume to retail customers in 2014 consisted of products of other beveragecompanies and the Companys own products. The Company must satisfy various requirements under its beverage agreements, including the new CBAs for the Expansion Territories, which include additional obligations the Company must perform. Failureto satisfy these requirements could result in the loss of distribution rights for the respective products under one or more of these beverage agreements. The occurrence of other events defined in these agreements could also result in the terminationof one or more beverage agreements.   16 Table of ContentsMaterial changes in, or the Companys inability to satisfy, the performancerequirements for marketing funding support, or decreases from historic levels of marketing funding support, could reduce the Companys profitability.  Material changes in the performance requirements, or decreases in the levels of marketing funding support historically provided, under marketing programs with The Coca-Cola Company and other beveragecompanies, or the Companys inability to meet the performance requirements for the anticipated levels of such marketing funding support payments, could adversely affect the Companys profitability. The Coca-Cola Company and other beveragecompanies are under no obligation to continue marketing funding support at historic levels.  Changes in The Coca-ColaCompanys and other beverage companies levels of advertising, marketing spending and product innovation could reduce the Companys sales volume.  The Coca-Cola Companys and other beverage companies levels of advertising, marketing spending and product innovation directly impact the Companys operations. While the Company does notbelieve there will be significant changes in the levels of marketing and advertising by the Beverage Companies, there can be no assurance that historic levels will continue. The Companys volume growth will also continue to be dependent onproduct innovation by the Beverage Companies, especially The Coca-Cola Company. Decreases in marketing, advertising and product innovation by the Beverage Companies could adversely impact the profitability of the Company. The inability of the Companys aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Companys purchase requirements couldreduce the Companys profitability.  The Company currently obtains all of its aluminum cans from two domesticsuppliers and all of its plastic bottles from two domestic cooperatives. The inability of these aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Companys requirements for containers could result in short-term shortages until alternativesources of supply can be located. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate. Failure of the aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meetthe Companys purchase requirements could reduce the Companys profitability.  The inability of the Company tooffset higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, increased bottle/can volume or reduced expenses could have an adverse impact on the Companys profitability. Raw material costs, including the costs for plastic bottles, aluminum cans and high fructose corn syrup, have been subject to significantprice volatility in the past and may continue to be in the future. In addition, there are no limits on the prices The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies can charge for concentrate. If the Company cannot offset higher raw material costswith higher selling prices, increased sales volume or reductions in other costs, the Companys profitability could be adversely affected.  The consolidation among suppliers of certain of the Companys raw materials could have an adverse impact on the Companys profitability. In recent years, there has been consolidation among suppliers of certain of the Companys raw materials. The reduction in the numberof competitive sources of supply could have an adverse effect upon the Companys ability to negotiate the lowest costs and, in light of the Companys relatively small in-plant raw material inventory levels, has the potential for causinginterruptions in the Companys supply of raw materials.  The increasing reliance on purchased finished goods fromexternal sources makes the Company subject to incremental risks that could have an adverse impact on the Companys profitability.  The Company has become increasingly reliant on purchased finished goods from external sources versus the Companys internal production. As a result, the Company is subject to incremental riskincluding, but not limited to, product availability, price variability, and product quality and production capacity shortfalls for externally purchased finished goods. The Companys operations in the Expansion Territories are more exposed tothis risk   17 Table of Contentsthan the Companys operations in the Legacy Territories because, with exceptions under which the Company may produce finished goods itself, the Company is required under the CBAs for theExpansion Territories to purchase finished goods from CCR and other authorized external sources in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Finished Goods Supply Agreement entered into by the Company at the closing of each Expansion Territorytransaction in quantities required to satisfy fully the demand for beverages and related products the Company is authorized to distribute in the Expansion Territory.  Sustained increases in fuel prices or the inability of the Company to secure adequate supplies of fuel could have an adverse impact on the Companys profitability. The Company uses significant amounts of fuel in the distribution of its products. International or domestic geopolitical or other eventscould impact the supply and cost of fuel and could impact the timely delivery of the Companys products to its customers. While the Company is working to reduce fuel consumption and manage the Companys fuel costs, there can be noassurance that the Company will succeed in limiting the impact on the Companys business or future cost increases. The Company may use derivative instruments to hedge some or all of the Companys projected diesel fuel and gasolinepurchases. These derivative instruments relate to fuel used in the Companys delivery fleet and other vehicles. Sustained upward pressure in these costs could reduce the profitability of the Companys operations. Sustained increases in workers compensation, employment practices and vehicle accident claims costs could reduce theCompanys profitability.  The Company uses various insurance structures to manage its workers compensation,auto liability, medical and other insurable risks. These structures consist of retentions, deductibles, limits and a diverse group of insurers that serve to strategically transfer and mitigate the financial impact of losses. The Company usescommercial insurance for claims as a risk reduction strategy to minimize catastrophic losses. Losses are accrued using assumptions and procedures followed in the insurance industry, adjusted for company-specific history and expectations. Althoughthe Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases. Sustained upward pressure in these costs could reduce the profitability of theCompanys operations.  Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce the Companysprofitability.  The Companys profitability is substantially affected by the cost of pension retirement benefits,postretirement medical benefits and current employees medical benefits. In recent years, the Company has experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond the Companys control, includingincreases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there canbe no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce the profitability of the Companys operations. Product safety and quality concerns, including concerns related to perceived artificiality of ingredients, could negatively affectthe Companys business.  The Companys success depends in large part on its ability to maintain consumerconfidence in the safety and quality of all its products. The Company has rigorous product safety and quality standards. However, if beverage products taken to market are or become contaminated or adulterated, the Company may be required to conductcostly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which would cause its business to suffer. In addition, regulatory actions, activities by nongovernmental organizations and public debate and concernsabout perceived negative safety and quality consequences of certain ingredients in the Companys products, such as non-nutritive sweeteners, may erode consumers confidence in the safety and quality issues, whether or not justified, andcould result in additional governmental regulations concerning the marketing and labeling of the Companys products, negative publicity, or actual or threatened legal actions, all of which could damage the reputation of the Companysproducts and may reduce demand for the Companys products.   18 Table of ContentsCybersecurity risks - technology failures or cyberattacks on the Companyssystems could disrupt the Companys operations and negatively impact the Companys business.  The Companyincreasingly relies on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information. For example, the Companys production and distribution facilities, inventory management and driver handheld devices all utilizeinformation technology to maximize efficiencies and minimize costs. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communication between personnel, customers and suppliers depends on information technology. Like most companies, the Companysinformation technology systems may be vulnerable to interruption due to a variety of events beyond the Companys control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses,hackers and other security issues. The Company has technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate the Companys risk to these vulnerabilities, but these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly toensure that the Companys operations are not disrupted.  Changes in interest rates could adversely affect theprofitability of the Company.  As of February 28, 2015, $153.0 million of the Companys debt and capital leaseobligations of $584.8 million were subject to changes in short-term interest rates. The Companys $350 million revolving credit facility is subject to changes in short-term interest rates. On February 28, 2015, the Company had $153.0 million ofoutstanding borrowings on the $350 million revolving credit facility. If interest rates increase in the future, it could increase the Companys borrowing cost and it could reduce the Companys overall profitability. The Companyspension and postretirement medical benefits costs are also subject to changes in interest rates. A decline in interest rates used to discount the Companys pension and postretirement medical liabilities could increase the cost of these benefitsand increase the overall liability.  The level of the Companys debt could restrict the Companys operatingflexibility and limit the Companys ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs.  As of February 28,2015, the Company had $584.8 million of debt and capital lease obligations. The Companys level of debt requires the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of the Companys future cash flows from operations to the payment of principaland interest, thereby reducing the funds available to the Company for other purposes. The Companys debt can negatively impact the Companys operations by (1) limiting the Companys ability and/or increasing the cost to obtainfunding for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including funding the cash purchase price of future territory expansions; (2) increasing the Companys vulnerability to economic downturns and adverseindustry conditions by limiting the Companys ability to react to changing economic and business conditions; and (3) exposing the Company to a risk that a significant decrease in cash flows from operations could make it difficult for theCompany to meet the Companys debt service requirements.  The Companys credit ratings could be negativelyimpacted by changes to The Coca-Cola Companys credit ratings.  The Companys credit rating could besignificantly impacted by capital management activities of The Coca-Cola Company and/or changes in the credit ratings of The Coca-Cola Company. A lower credit rating could significantly increase the Companys interest costs or could have anadverse effect on the Companys ability to obtain additional financing at acceptable interest rates or to refinance existing debt.  Changes in legal contingencies could adversely impact the Companys future profitability.  Changes from expectations for the resolution of outstanding legal claims and assessments could have a material adverse impact on the Companys profitability and financial condition. In addition, theCompanys failure to abide by laws, orders or other legal commitments could subject the Company to fines, penalties or other damages.   19 Table of ContentsLegislative changes that affect the Companys distribution, packaging andproducts could reduce demand for the Companys products or increase the Companys costs.  The Companysbusiness model is dependent on the availability of the Companys various products and packages in multiple channels and locations to better satisfy the needs of the Companys customers and consumers. Laws that restrict the Companysability to distribute products in schools and other venues, as well as laws that require deposits for certain types of packages or those that limit the Companys ability to design new packages or market certain packages, could negatively impactthe financial results of the Company.  In addition, excise or other taxes imposed on the sale of certain of the Companysproducts by the federal government and certain state and local governments could cause consumers to shift away from purchasing products of the Company. If enacted, such taxes could materially affect the Companys business and financial results,particularly if they were enacted in a form that incorporated them into the shelf prices for the Companys products. Significant additional labeling or warning requirements may inhibit sales of affected products. In 2014, the FDA proposed major changes to the nutrition labels required on all packaged foods and beverages, including those for most ofthe Companys products. If the proposed changes are adopted, the Company and its competitors will be required to make nutrition label updates, which include updating serving sizes, including information about total calories in a beverageproduct container and providing information about any added sugars or nutrients. If the pending FDA nutrition label changes proposed become final, they will increase the Companys costs and could inhibit sales of one or more of theCompanys major products. The timeline for implementation of any final regulations adopted by the FDA regarding changes to required nutrition labels is currently expected to be a period of up to two years. Changes in income tax laws and increases in income tax rates could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financialresults.  The Company is subject to income taxes within the United States. The Companys annual income tax rate isbased upon the Companys income and the federal tax laws and the various state tax laws within the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Increases in federal or state income tax rates and changes in federal or state tax laws could have amaterial adverse impact on the Companys financial results.  Additional taxes resulting from tax audits couldadversely impact the Companys future profitability.  An assessment of additional taxes resulting from audits ofthe Companys tax filings could have an adverse impact on the Companys profitability, cash flows and financial condition.  Natural disasters and unfavorable weather could negatively impact the Companys future profitability.  Natural disasters or unfavorable weather conditions in the geographic regions in which the Company does business could have an adverse impact on the Companys revenue and profitability. Unusuallycold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for the Companys products and contribute to lower sales, which could adversely affect the Companys profitability for such periods. Prolonged droughtconditions in the geographic regions in which the Company does business could lead to restrictions on the use of water, which could adversely affect the Companys ability to manufacture and distribute products and the Companys cost to doso.  Global climate change or legal, regulatory, or market responses to such change could adversely impactthe Companys future profitability.  There is some scientific sentiment that increasedconcentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere may have been the dominant cause of observed warming of the earths climate system since the mid-20th century, and that continued emissionof GHGs could cause further warming and long-lasting changes in components of the global climate system, potentially increasing the   20 Table of Contentslikelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems. Changing weather patterns, along with the increased frequency or duration of extreme weather and climateevents, such as an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events, could impact some of the Companys facilities and the availability or increase the cost of key raw materials that the Company uses to produce its products. In addition,the sale of the Companys products can be impacted by weather conditions and climate events.  Growing concern over theeffects of climate change, including warming of the global climate system, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting GHG emissions. For example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has proposedregulations under the Clean Air Act to reduce GHG emissions from existing coal-fired power plants, which are expected to become final in 2015, that would require each state to submit a plan specifying how it would reduce GHG emissions from existingcoal-fired power plants located within its borders It is anticipated that when the states implement their plans they could lead to the eventual closing of many of these plants. These USEPA proposed regulations or future laws enacted or regulationsadopted to limit GHG emissions that directly or indirectly affect the Companys production, distribution, packaging, cost of raw materials, fuel, ingredients and water could all impact the Companys business and financial results. Issues surrounding labor relations could adversely impact the Companys future profitability and/or its operatingefficiency.  Approximately 6% of the Companys employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Theinability to renegotiate subsequent agreements on satisfactory terms and conditions could result in work interruptions or stoppages, which could have a material impact on the profitability of the Company. Also, the terms and conditions of existingor renegotiated agreements could increase costs, or otherwise affect the Companys ability to fully implement operational changes to improve overall efficiency. Two collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 5% of theCompanys employees expired during 2014 and the Company entered into new agreements in 2014. One collective bargaining agreement covering approximately .3% of the Companys employees will expire during 2015. The Companys ability to change distribution methods and business practices could be negatively affected by United StatesCoca-Cola bottler system disputes.  Litigation filed by some United States bottlers of Coca-Cola products indicatesthat disagreements may exist within the Coca-Cola bottler system concerning distribution methods and business practices. Although the litigation has been resolved, disagreements among various Coca-Cola bottlers could adversely affect theCompanys ability to fully implement its business plans in the future.  Obesity and other health concerns mayreduce demand for some of the Companys products.  Consumers, public health officials, public health advocates andgovernment officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the public health consequences associated with obesity, particularly among young people. In The production and marketing of beverages are subject to the rules and regulations of the FDAand other federal, state and local health agencies. The FDA also regulates the labeling of containers under The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990. The Nutrition Facts label has not changed significantly since it was first introduced in1994. In March 2014, the FDA proposed new rules that would result in major changes to nutrition labels on all food packages, including the packaging for the Companys products, that would, among other things, require those labels to displaycaloric counts in large type, reflect larger portion sizes and display on a separate line on the label the amount of sugars that are added to the product. If these proposed rules are adopted by the FDA, the Company expects to have up to two years toput the required labeling changes into effect on the packaging for the products it manufactures and distributes. In addition, some researchers, health advocates and dietary guidelines are encouraging consumers to reduce the consumption of sugar,including sugar sparkling beverages. Increasing public concern about these issues, possible new taxes and governmental regulations concerning the production, marketing, labeling or availability of the Companys beverages, and negative  21 Table of Contentspublicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against the Company or other companies in the same industry relating to the marketing, labeling or sale of sugar sparkling beveragesmay reduce demand for these beverages, which could adversely affect the Companys profitability.  The Company hasexperienced public policy challenges regarding the sale of soft drinks in schools, particularly elementary, middle and high schools.  A number of states have regulations restricting the sale of soft drinks and other foods in schools. Many of these restrictions have existed for several years in connection with subsidized meal programs inschools. The focus has more recently turned to the growing health, nutrition and obesity concerns of todays youth. The impact of restrictive legislation, if widely enacted, could have an adverse impact on the Companys products, image andreputation.  If the financing of any future territory or other acquisitions involves issuing additional equitysecurities, their issuance would be dilutive and could affect the market price of the Companys Common Stock. Acquisitions of the distribution assets of CCR in the Expansion Territory transactions completed to date have been financed with availablecash or by draws on our revolving credit facility. The Company may fund any future territory or other acquisition transactions through the use of existing cash, cash equivalents or investments, debt financing, including draws on the Companysrevolving credit facility, the issuance of equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing. Any future acquisitions of additional distribution or other assets that are financed in whole or in part by issuing additional shares of theCompanys Common Stock would be dilutive, which could affect the market price of our Common Stock.  Theconcentration of the Companys capital stock ownership with the Harrison family limits other stockholders ability to influence corporate matters.  Members of the Harrison family, including the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, J. Frank Harrison, III, beneficially own shares of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock representingapproximately 86% of the total voting power of the Companys outstanding capital stock. In addition, three members of the Harrison family, including Mr. Harrison, serve on the Board of Directors of the Company. As a result, members of theHarrison family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over the Companys management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by the Companys stockholders. Additionally, as a result of theHarrison familys significant beneficial ownership of the Companys outstanding voting stock, the Company has relied on the controlled company exemption from certain corporate governance requirements of The NASDAQ Stock MarketLLC. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control otherwise favored by the Companys other stockholders and could depress the stock price. It also limits other stockholders ability toinfluence corporate matters and, as a result, the Company may take actions that the Companys other stockholders may not view as beneficial.   "
1,COKE,COCA-COLA BTLNG CONS,2014-03-14,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
  In addition to other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Companys business. The Companys business, financial condition orresults of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.  The Company may not be able torespond successfully to changes in the marketplace.  The Company operates in the highly competitive nonalcoholicbeverage industry and faces strong competition from other general and specialty beverage companies. The Companys response to continued and increased customer and competitor consolidations and marketplace competition may result in lower thanexpected net pricing of the Companys products. The Companys ability to gain or maintain the Companys share of sales or gross margins may be limited by the actions of the Companys competitors, which may have advantages insetting their prices due to lower raw material costs. Competitive pressures in the markets in which the Company operates may cause channel and product mix to shift away from more profitable channels and packages. If the Company is unable to maintainor increase volume in higher-margin products and in packages sold through higher-margin channels (e.g., immediate consumption), pricing and gross margins could be adversely affected. The Companys efforts to improve pricing may result in lowerthan expected sales volume.  Changes in how significant customers market or promote the Companys products couldreduce revenue.  The Companys revenue is affected by how significant customers market or promote theCompanys products. Revenue has been negatively impacted by less aggressive price promotion by some retailers in the future consumption channels over the past several years. If the Companys significant customers change the manner in whichthey market or promote the Companys products, the Companys revenue and profitability could be adversely impacted. Changes in the Companys top customer relationships could impact revenues and profitability. The Company is exposed to risks resulting from several large customers that account for a significant portion of its bottle/can volume andrevenue. The Companys two largest customers accounted for approximately 29% of the Companys 2013 bottle/can volume to retail customers and approximately 21% of the Companys total net sales. The loss of one or both of thesecustomers could adversely affect the Companys results of operations. These customers typically make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand and customer service performance and generally do notenter into long-term contracts. In addition, these significant customers may re-evaluate or refine their business practices related to inventories, product displays, logistics or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. TheCompanys results of operations could be adversely affected if revenue from one or more of these customers is significantly reduced or if the cost of complying with these customers demands is significant. If receivables from one or moreof these customers become uncollectible, the Companys results of operations may be adversely impacted.  Changes inpublic and consumer preferences related to nonalcoholic beverages could reduce demand for the Companys products and reduce profitability.  The Companys business depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of the Companys business depends in large measure on workingwith the Beverage Companies to meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market. Health and wellness trends throughout the marketplace have resulted in a shift from sugar sparkling beverages to diet sparkling beverages, tea, sports drinks,enhanced water and bottled water over the past several years. Failure to satisfy changing consumer preferences, particularly those of young people, could adversely affect the profitability of the Companys business. The Companys sales can be impacted by the health and stability of the general economy. Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the geographic markets in which theCompany does business, may have the temporary effect of reducing the demand   12 Table of Contentsfor certain of the Companys products. For example, economic forces may cause consumers to shift away from purchasing higher-margin products and packages sold through immediate consumptionand other highly profitable channels. Adverse economic conditions could also increase the likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which would increase the risk of uncollectibility of certain accounts. Each of these factors couldadversely affect the Companys revenue, price realization, gross margins and overall financial condition and operating results.  Miscalculation of the Companys need for infrastructure investment could impact the Companys financial results. Projected requirements of the Companys infrastructure investments may differ from actual levels if the Companys volume growthis not as the Company anticipates. The Companys infrastructure investments are generally long-term in nature; therefore, it is possible that investments made today may not generate the returns expected by the Company due to future changes inthe marketplace. Significant changes from the Companys expected returns on cold drink equipment, fleet, technology and supply chain infrastructure investments could adversely affect the Companys consolidated financial results. The Companys inability to meet requirements under its beverage agreements could result in the loss ofdistribution rights.  Approximately 88% of the Companys bottle/can volume to retail customers in 2013 consistedof products of The Coca-Cola Company, which is the sole supplier of these products or of the concentrates or syrups required to manufacture these products. The remaining 12% of the Companys bottle/can volume to retail customers in 2013consisted of products of other beverage companies and the Companys own products. The Company must satisfy various requirements under its beverage agreements. Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in the loss of distribution rightsfor the respective products.  Material changes in, or the Companys inability to satisfy, the performancerequirements for marketing funding support, or decreases from historic levels of marketing funding support, could reduce the Companys profitability.  Material changes in the performance requirements, or decreases in the levels of marketing funding support historically provided, under marketing programs with The Coca-Cola Company and other beveragecompanies, or the Companys inability to meet the performance requirements for the anticipated levels of such marketing funding support payments, could adversely affect the Companys profitability. The Coca-Cola Company and other beveragecompanies are under no obligation to continue marketing funding support at historic levels.  Changes in The Coca-ColaCompanys and other beverage companies levels of advertising, marketing spending and product innovation could reduce the Companys sales volume.  The Coca-Cola Companys and other beverage companies levels of advertising, marketing spending and product innovation directly impact the Companys operations. While the Company does notbelieve there will be significant changes in the levels of marketing and advertising by the Beverage Companies, there can be no assurance that historic levels will continue. The Companys volume growth will also continue to be dependent onproduct innovation by the Beverage Companies, especially The Coca-Cola Company. Decreases in marketing, advertising and product innovation by the Beverage Companies could adversely impact the profitability of the Company. The inability of the Companys aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Companys purchase requirements couldreduce the Companys profitability.  The Company currently obtains all of its aluminum cans from two domesticsuppliers and all of its plastic bottles from two domestic cooperatives. The inability of these aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Companys requirements for containers could result in short-term shortages until alternativesources of   13 Table of Contentssupply can be located. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate. Failure of thealuminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Companys purchase requirements could reduce the Companys profitability.  The inability of the Company to offset higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, increased bottle/can volume or reduced expenses could have an adverse impact on the Companysprofitability.  Raw material costs, including the costs for plastic bottles, aluminum cans and high fructose cornsyrup, have been subject to significant price volatility and have increased in recent years at faster rates than the general rate of inflation. In addition, there are no limits on the prices The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies cancharge for concentrate. If the Company cannot offset higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, increased sales volume or reductions in other costs, the Companys profitability could be adversely affected. The consolidation among suppliers of certain of the Companys raw materials could have an adverse impact on the Companysprofitability.  In recent years, there has been consolidation among suppliers of certain of the Companys rawmaterials. The reduction in the number of competitive sources of supply could have an adverse effect upon the Companys ability to negotiate the lowest costs and, in light of the Companys relatively small in-plant raw material inventorylevels, has the potential for causing interruptions in the Companys supply of raw materials.  The increasingreliance on purchased finished goods from external sources makes the Company subject to incremental risks that could have an adverse impact on the Companys profitability. With the introduction of FUZE and glacéau products into the Companys portfolio during 2007 and Monster Energy products during2008, the Company has become increasingly reliant on purchased finished goods from external sources versus the Companys internal production. As a result, the Company is subject to incremental risk including, but not limited to, productavailability, price variability, product quality and production capacity shortfalls for externally purchased finished goods. Sustained increases in fuel prices or the inability of the Company to secure adequate supplies of fuel could have an adverse impacton the Companys profitability.  The Company uses significant amounts of fuel in the distribution of its products.International or domestic geopolitical or other events could impact the supply and cost of fuel and could impact the timely delivery of the Companys products to its customers. While the Company is working to reduce fuel consumption and managethe Companys fuel costs, there can be no assurance that the Company will succeed in limiting the impact on the Companys business or future cost increases. The Company may use derivative instruments to hedge some or all of theCompanys projected diesel fuel and unleaded gasoline purchases. These derivative instruments relate to fuel used in the Companys delivery fleet and other vehicles. Continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce the profitabilityof the Companys operations.  Sustained increases in workers compensation, employment practices and vehicleaccident claims costs could reduce the Companys profitability.  The Company uses various insurance structures tomanage its workers compensation, auto liability, medical and other insurable risks. These structures consist of retentions, deductibles, limits and a diverse group of insurers that serve to strategically transfer and mitigate the financialimpact of losses. The Company uses commercial insurance for claims as a risk reduction strategy to minimize catastrophic losses. Losses are accrued using assumptions and procedures followed in the insurance industry, adjusted for company-specifichistory and expectations. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases. Continued upward pressure in these costs could reducethe profitability of the Companys operations.   14 Table of ContentsSustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce the Companysprofitability.  The Companys profitability is substantially affected by the cost of pension retirement benefits,postretirement medical benefits and current employees medical benefits. In recent years, the Company has experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond the Companys control, includingincreases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there canbe no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce the profitability of the Companys operations. In 2013, the Company announced a limited Lump Sum Window distribution of present valued pension benefits to terminated plan participantsmeeting certain criteria. Based upon the number of plan participants electing to take the lump-sum distribution and the total amount of such distributions, the Company incurred a noncash charge of $12.0 million in 2013. The reduction in the numberof plan participants and the reduction of plan assets will reduce the cost of administering the pension plan in the future. Product safety and quality concerns, including concerns related to perceived artificiality of ingredients, could negatively affectthe Companys business.  The Companys success depends in large part on its ability to maintain consumerconfidence in the safety and quality of all its products. The Company has rigorous product safety and quality standards. However, if beverage products taken to market are or become contaminated or adulterated, the Company may be required to conductcostly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which would cause its business to suffer. In addition, regulatory actions, activities by nongovernmental organizations and public debate and concernsabout perceived negative safety and quality consequences of certain ingredients in the Companys products, such as non-nutritive sweeteners, may erode consumers confidence in the safety and quality issues, whether or not justified, couldresult in additional governmental regulations concerning the marketing and labeling of the Companys products, negative publicity, or actual or threatened legal actions, all of which could damage the reputation of the Companys productsand may reduce demand for the Companys products.  Cybersecurity risks - technology failures or cyberattacks on theCompanys systems could disrupt the Companys operations and negatively impact the Companys business. The Company increasingly relies on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information. For example, theCompanys production and distribution facilities, inventory management and driver handheld devices all utilize information technology to maximize efficiencies and minimize costs. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communication betweenpersonnel, customers and suppliers depends on information technology. Like most companies, the Companys information technology systems may be vulnerable to interruption due to a variety of events beyond the Companys control, including,but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. The Company has technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate theCompanys risk to these vulnerabilities, but these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to ensure that the Companys operations are not disrupted.  Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the profitability of the Company.  As of December 29, 2013, $25.0 million of the Companys debt and capital lease obligations of $463.6 million were subject to changes in short-term interest rates. The Companys $200 millionrevolving credit facility and $20 million uncommitted line of credit are subject to changes in short-term interest rates. On December 29, 2013, the Company had $5.0 million of outstanding borrowings on the $200 million revolving credit facilityand $20.0 million of outstanding borrowing on the $20 million uncommitted line of credit. If interest rates increase in the future, it could increase the Companys borrowing cost and it could reduce the Companys overall  15 Table of Contentsprofitability. The Companys pension and postretirement medical benefits costs are also subject to changes in interest rates. A decline in interest rates used to discount the Companyspension and postretirement medical liabilities could increase the cost of these benefits and increase the overall liability. The level of the Companys debt could restrict the Companys operating flexibility and limit the Companys abilityto incur additional debt to fund future needs.  As of December 29, 2013, the Company had $463.6 million of debtand capital lease obligations. The Companys level of debt requires the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of the Companys future cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest, thereby reducing the fundsavailable to the Company for other purposes. The Companys debt can negatively impact the Companys operations by (1) limiting the Companys ability and/or increasing the cost to obtain funding for working capital, capitalexpenditures and other general corporate purposes; (2) increasing the Companys vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions by limiting the Companys ability to react to changing economic and businessconditions; and (3) exposing the Company to a risk that a significant decrease in cash flows from operations could make it difficult for the Company to meet the Companys debt service requirements. The Companys credit ratings could be negatively impacted by changes to The Coca-Cola Companys credit ratings. The Companys credit ratings could be significantly impacted by capital management activities of The Coca-ColaCompany and/or changes in the credit ratings of The Coca-Cola Company. A lower credit rating could significantly increase the Companys interest costs or could have an adverse effect on the Companys ability to obtain additional financingat acceptable interest rates or to refinance existing debt.  Changes in legal contingencies could adversely impact theCompanys future profitability.  Changes from expectations for the resolution of outstanding legal claims andassessments could have a material adverse impact on the Companys profitability and financial condition. In addition, the Companys failure to abide by laws, orders or other legal commitments could subject the Company to fines, penaltiesor other damages.  Legislative changes that affect the Companys distribution, packaging and products could reducedemand for the Companys products or increase the Companys costs.  The Companys business model isdependent on the availability of the Companys various products and packages in multiple channels and locations to better satisfy the needs of the Companys customers and consumers. Laws that restrict the Companys ability todistribute products in schools and other venues, as well as laws that require deposits for certain types of packages or those that limit the Companys ability to design new packages or market certain packages, could negatively impact thefinancial results of the Company.  In addition, excise or other taxes imposed on the sale of certain of the Companysproducts by the federal government and certain state and local governments could cause consumers to shift away from purchasing products of the Company. If enacted, such taxes could materially affect the Companys business and financial results,particularly if they were enacted in a form that incorporated them into the shelf prices for the Companys products. Significant additional labeling or warning requirements may inhibit sales of affected products. The FDA is expected to propose in 2014 major changes to nutrition labels on all food packages, including those for the Companysproducts. Various other jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements relating to the content or perceived adverse health consequences of certain of the Companys products. If the FDA nutritionlabel proposed or any of these other types of requirements become applicable to one or more of the Companys major products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products.  16 Table of ContentsChanges in income tax laws and increases in income tax rates could have a materialadverse impact on the Companys financial results.  The Company is subject to income taxes within the UnitedStates. The Companys annual income tax rate is based upon the Companys income and the federal tax laws and the various state tax laws within the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Increases in federal or state income tax ratesand changes in federal or state tax laws could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial results. Additional taxes resulting from tax audits could adversely impact the Companys future profitability. An assessment of additional taxes resulting from audits of the Companys tax filings could have an adverse impact on theCompanys profitability, cash flows and financial condition.  Natural disasters and unfavorable weather couldnegatively impact the Companys future profitability.  Natural disasters or unfavorable weather conditions in thegeographic regions in which the Company does business could have an adverse impact on the Companys revenue and profitability. Unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for theCompanys products and contribute to lower sales, which could adversely affect the Companys profitability for such periods. Prolonged drought conditions in the geographic regions in which the Company does business could lead torestrictions on the use of water, which could adversely affect the Companys ability to manufacture and distribute products and the Companys cost to do so.  Global climate change or legal, regulatory, or market responses to such change could adversely impact the Companys future profitability. The growing political and scientific sentiment is that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in theatmosphere are influencing global weather patterns. Changing weather patterns, along with the increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions, could impact the availability or increase the cost of key raw materials that the Companyuses to produce its products. In addition, the sale of these products can be impacted by weather conditions.  Concern overclimate change, including global warming, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) began imposing GHG regulations onutilities, refineries and major manufacturers in 2011. Although the immediate effect was minor, as such regulations apply only to those that are planning to build large new facilities or materially modify existing ones, over the next decade theUSEPA plans to extend the scope of the GHG regulations to cover virtually all sources of GHGs. Those USEPA regulations or future laws enacted or regulations adopted that directly or indirectly affect the Companys production,distribution, packaging, cost of raw materials, fuel, ingredients and water could all impact the Companys business and financial results.  Issues surrounding labor relations could adversely impact the Companys future profitability and/or its operating efficiency. Approximately 6.5% of the Companys employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The inability to renegotiatesubsequent agreements on satisfactory terms and conditions could result in work interruptions or stoppages, which could have a material impact on the profitability of the Company. Also, the terms and conditions of existing or renegotiated agreementscould increase costs, or otherwise affect the Companys ability to fully implement operational changes to improve overall efficiency. Two collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 0.7% of the Companys employees expiredduring 2013 and the Company entered into new agreements in 2013. Two collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 5% of the Companys employees will expire during 2014.   17 Table of ContentsThe Companys ability to change distribution methods and business practices couldbe negatively affected by United States Coca-Cola bottler system disputes.  Litigation filed by some United Statesbottlers of Coca-Cola products indicates that disagreements may exist within the Coca-Cola bottler system concerning distribution methods and business practices. Although the litigation has been resolved, disagreements among various Coca-Colabottlers could adversely affect the Companys ability to fully implement its business plans in the future. Managements use of estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on reported results. The Companys consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements include estimates andassumptions by management that impact reported amounts. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Changes in accounting standards could affect the Companys reported financial results. New accounting standards or pronouncements that may become applicable to the Company from time to time, or changes in the interpretationof existing standards and pronouncements could have a significant effect on the Companys reported results for the affected periods.  Obesity and other health concerns may reduce demand for some of the Companys products.  Consumers, public health officials, public health advocates and government officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the public health consequences associated with obesity, particularly amongyoung people. In February 2013, a group of public health officials and health advocates submitted a petition to the FDA requesting that agency to regulate the amount of caloric sweeteners in sparkling and other beverages. The FDA has not respondedto the petition, but is expected to propose in 2014 major changes to nutrition labels on all food packages, including a separate line for sugars that are added to the product. In addition, some researchers, health advocates and dietary guidelinesare encouraging consumers to reduce the consumption of sugar, including sugar sparkling beverages. Increasing public concern about these issues, possible new taxes and governmental regulations concerning the production, marketing, labeling oravailability of the Companys beverages, and negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against the Company or other companies in the same industry relating to the marketing, labeling or sale of sugar sparklingbeverages may reduce demand for these beverages, which could adversely affect the Companys profitability.  TheCompany has experienced public policy challenges regarding the sale of soft drinks in schools, particularly elementary, middle and high schools.  A number of states have regulations restricting the sale of soft drinks and other foods in schools. Many of these restrictions have existed for several years in connection with subsidized meal programs inschools. The focus has more recently turned to the growing health, nutrition and obesity concerns of todays youth. The impact of restrictive legislation, if widely enacted, could have an adverse impact on the Companys products, image andreputation.  The concentration of the Companys capital stock ownership with the Harrison family limits otherstockholders ability to influence corporate matters.  Members of the Harrison family, including theCompanys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, J. Frank Harrison, III, beneficially own shares of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock representing approximately 86% of the total voting power of the Companys outstanding capital stock.In addition, three members of the Harrison family, including Mr. Harrison, III, serve on the Board of Directors of the Company. As a result, members of the Harrison family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control overthe Companys management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by the Companys stockholders. Additionally, as a result of the Harrison familys significant beneficial ownership of the Companysoutstanding voting stock, the Company has relied on the controlled company exemption from certain corporate   18 Table of Contentsgovernance requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control otherwise favored by the Companysother stockholders and could depress the stock price. It also limits other stockholders ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, the Company may take actions that the Companys other stockholders may not view asbeneficial.   "

  In addition to other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Companys business. The Companys business, financial condition orresults of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.  The Company may not be able torespond successfully to changes in the marketplace.  The Company operates in the highly competitive nonalcoholicbeverage industry and faces strong competition from other general and specialty beverage companies. The Companys response to continued and increased customer and competitor consolidations and marketplace competition may result in lower thanexpected net pricing of the Companys products. The Companys ability to gain or maintain the Companys share of sales or gross margins may be limited by the actions of the Companys competitors, which may have advantages insetting their prices due to lower raw material costs. Competitive pressures in the markets in which the Company operates may cause channel and product mix to shift away from more profitable channels and packages. If the Company is unable to maintainor increase volume in higher-margin products and in packages sold through higher-margin channels (e.g., immediate consumption), pricing and gross margins could be adversely affected. The Companys efforts to improve pricing may result in lowerthan expected sales volume.  Acquisitions of bottlers by their franchisors may lead to uncertainty in the Coca-Colabottler system or adversely impact the Company.  The Coca-Cola Company acquired the North American operations ofCoca-Cola Enterprises Inc. in 2010, and the Companys primary competitors were acquired at approximately the same time by their franchisor. These transactions may cause uncertainty within the Coca-Cola bottler system or adversely impact theCompany and its business. At this time, it remains uncertain what the ultimate impact of these transactions will be on the Companys business and financial results.  Changes in how significant customers market or promote the Companys products could reduce revenue.  The Companys revenue is affected by how significant customers market or promote the Companys products. Revenue has been negatively impacted by less aggressive price promotion by some retailersin the future consumption channels over the past several years. If the Companys significant customers change the manner in which they market or promote the Companys products, the Companys revenue and profitability could beadversely impacted.  Changes in the Companys top customer relationships could impact revenues and profitability. The Company is exposed to risks resulting from several large customers that account for a significant portion of itsbottle/can volume and revenue. The Companys two largest customers accounted for approximately 30% of the Companys 2012 bottle/can volume to retail customers and approximately 21% of the Companys total net sales. The loss of one orboth of these customers could adversely affect the Companys results of   11 Table of Contentsoperations. These customers typically make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand and customer service performance and generally do not enter intolong-term contracts. In addition, these significant customers may re-evaluate or refine their business practices related to inventories, product displays, logistics or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. The Companys resultsof operations could be adversely affected if revenue from one or more of these customers is significantly reduced or if the cost of complying with these customers demands is significant. If receivables from one or more of these customersbecome uncollectible, the Companys results of operations may be adversely impacted. One of these customers has announced store closing in the United States, but the Company has not determined if this could affect the Companys results ofoperations.  Changes in public and consumer preferences related to nonalcoholic beverages could reduce demand for theCompanys products and reduce profitability.  The Companys business dependssubstantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of the Companys business depends in large measure on working with the Beverage Companies to meet the changing preferences of the broadconsumer market. Health and wellness trends throughout the marketplace have resulted in a shift from sugar sparkling beverages to diet sparkling beverages, tea, sports drinks, enhanced water and bottled water over the past several years. Failure tosatisfy changing consumer preferences could adversely affect the profitability of the Companys business.  TheCompanys sales can be impacted by the health and stability of the general economy.  Unfavorable changes ingeneral economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the geographic markets in which the Company does business, may have the temporary effect of reducing the demand for certain of the Companys products. For example,economic forces may cause consumers to shift away from purchasing higher-margin products and packages sold through immediate consumption and other highly profitable channels. Adverse economic conditions could also increase the likelihood of customerdelinquencies and bankruptcies, which would increase the risk of uncollectibility of certain accounts. Each of these factors could adversely affect the Companys revenue, price realization, gross margins and overall financial condition andoperating results.  Miscalculation of the Companys need for infrastructure investment could impact theCompanys financial results.  Projected requirements of the Companys infrastructure investments may differfrom actual levels if the Companys volume growth is not as the Company anticipates. The Companys infrastructure investments are generally long-term in nature; therefore, it is possible that investments made today may not generate thereturns expected by the Company due to future changes in the marketplace. Significant changes from the Companys expected returns on cold drink equipment, fleet, technology and supply chain infrastructure investments could adversely affect theCompanys consolidated financial results.  The Companys inability to meet requirements under its beverageagreements could result in the loss of distribution rights.  Approximately 88% of the Companys bottle/can volumeto retail customers in 2012 consisted of products of The Coca-Cola Company, which is the sole supplier of these products or of the concentrates or syrups required to manufacture these products. The remaining 12% of the Companys bottle/canvolume to retail customers in 2012 consisted of products of other beverage companies and the Companys own products. The Company must satisfy various requirements under its beverage agreements. Failure to satisfy these requirements could resultin the loss of distribution rights for the respective products.   12 Table of ContentsMaterial changes in, or the Companys inability to satisfy, the performancerequirements for marketing funding support, or decreases from historic levels of marketing funding support, could reduce the Companys profitability.  Material changes in the performance requirements, or decreases in the levels of marketing funding support historically provided, under marketing programs with The Coca-Cola Company and other beveragecompanies, or the Companys inability to meet the performance requirements for the anticipated levels of such marketing funding support payments, could adversely affect the Companys profitability. The Coca-Cola Company and other beveragecompanies are under no obligation to continue marketing funding support at historic levels.  Changes in The Coca-ColaCompanys and other beverage companies levels of advertising, marketing spending and product innovation could reduce the Companys sales volume.  The Coca-Cola Companys and other beverage companies levels of advertising, marketing spending and product innovation directly impact the Companys operations. While the Company does notbelieve there will be significant changes in the levels of marketing and advertising by the Beverage Companies, there can be no assurance that historic levels will continue. The Companys volume growth will also continue to be dependent onproduct innovation by the Beverage Companies, especially The Coca-Cola Company. Decreases in marketing, advertising and product innovation by the Beverage Companies could adversely impact the profitability of the Company. The inability of the Companys aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Companys purchase requirements couldreduce the Companys profitability.  The Company currently obtains all of its aluminum cans from two domesticsuppliers and all of its plastic bottles from two domestic cooperatives. The inability of these aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Companys requirements for containers could result in short-term shortages until alternativesources of supply can be located. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate. Failure of the aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meetthe Companys purchase requirements could reduce the Companys profitability.  The inability of the Company tooffset higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, increased bottle/can volume or reduced expenses could have an adverse impact on the Companys profitability. Raw material costs, including the costs for plastic bottles, aluminum cans and high fructose corn syrup, have been subject to significantprice volatility and have increased in recent years at faster rates than the general rate of inflation. In addition, there are no limits on the prices The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies can charge for concentrate. If the Companycannot offset higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, increased sales volume or reductions in other costs, the Companys profitability could be adversely affected. The consolidation among suppliers of certain of the Companys raw materials could have an adverse impact on the Companysprofitability.  In recent years, there has been consolidation among suppliers of certain of the Companys rawmaterials. The reduction in the number of competitive sources of supply could have an adverse effect upon the Companys ability to negotiate the lowest costs and, in light of the Companys relatively small in-plant raw material inventorylevels, has the potential for causing interruptions in the Companys supply of raw materials.  The increasingreliance on purchased finished goods from external sources makes the Company subject to incremental risks that could have an adverse impact on the Companys profitability. With the introduction of FUZE, Campbell and glacéau products into the Companys portfolio during 2007 and Monster Energyproducts during 2008, the Company has become increasingly reliant on purchased finished goods from external sources versus the Companys internal production. As a result, the Company is subject to incremental risk including, but not limited to,product availability, price variability, product quality and production capacity shortfalls for externally purchased finished goods.   13 Table of ContentsSustained increases in fuel prices or the inability of the Company to secure adequatesupplies of fuel could have an adverse impact on the Companys profitability.  The Company uses significantamounts of fuel in the distribution of its products. International or domestic geopolitical or other events could impact the supply and cost of fuel and could impact the timely delivery of the Companys products to its customers. While theCompany is working to reduce fuel consumption and manage the Companys fuel costs, there can be no assurance that the Company will succeed in limiting the impact on the Companys business or future cost increases. The Company may usederivative instruments to hedge some or all of the Companys projected diesel fuel and unleaded gasoline purchases. These derivative instruments relate to fuel used in the Companys delivery fleet and other vehicles. Continued upwardpressure in these costs could reduce the profitability of the Companys operations.  Sustained increases inworkers compensation, employment practices and vehicle accident claims costs could reduce the Companys profitability.  The Company uses various insurance structures to manage its workers compensation, auto liability, medical and other insurable risks. These structures consist of retentions, deductibles, limits and adiverse group of insurers that serve to strategically transfer and mitigate the financial impact of losses. Losses are accrued using assumptions and procedures followed in the insurance industry, adjusted for company-specific history andexpectations. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases. Continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce theprofitability of the Companys operations.  Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce theCompanys profitability.  The Companys profitability is substantially affected by the cost of pensionretirement benefits, postretirement medical benefits and current employees medical benefits. In recent years, the Company has experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond the Companyscontrol, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases inthese costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce the profitability of the Companys operations. On March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was signed into law. On March 30, 2010, acompanion bill, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Reconciliation Act), was also signed into law. The PPACA and the Reconciliation Act, when taken together, represent comprehensive health care reform legislationthat will likely affect the cost associated with providing employer-sponsored medical plans. The Company is continuing to assess the impact this legislation will have on the Companys employer-sponsored medical plans. Additionally, the PPACAand the Reconciliation Act include provisions that reduce the tax benefits available to employers that receive Medicare Part D subsidies.  Product liability claims brought against the Company or product recalls could negatively affect the Companys business, financial results and brand image. The Company may be liable if the consumption of the Companys products causes injury or illness. The Company may also be required torecall products if they become contaminated or are damaged or mislabeled. A significant product liability or other product-related legal judgment against the Company or a widespread recall of the Companys products could negatively impact theCompanys business, financial results and brand image.  Cybersecurity risks - technology failures or cyberattackson the Companys systems could disrupt the Companys operations and negatively impact the Companys business.  The Company increasingly relies on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information. For example, the Companys production and distribution facilities, inventory  14 Table of Contentsmanagement and driver handheld devices all utilize information technology to maximize efficiencies and minimize costs. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communication between personnel,customers and suppliers depends on information technology. Like most companies, the Companys information technology systems may be vulnerable to interruption due to a variety of events beyond the Companys control, including, but notlimited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. The Company has technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate the Companysrisk to these vulnerabilities, but these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to ensure that the Companys operations are not disrupted.  Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the profitability of the Company.  As of December 30, 2012, $50.0 million of the Companys debt and capital lease obligations of $493.0 million were subject to changes in short-term interest rates. The Companys $200 millionrevolving credit facility and $20 million uncommitted line of credit are subject to changes in short-term interest rates. On December 30, 2012, the Company had $30.0 million of outstanding borrowings on the $200 million revolving creditfacility and $20.0 million of outstanding borrowing on the $20 million uncommitted line of credit. If interest rates increase in the future, it could increase the Companys borrowing cost and it could reduce the Companys overallprofitability. The Companys pension and postretirement medical benefits costs are subject to changes in interest rates. A decline in interest rates used to discount the Companys pension and postretirement medical liabilities couldincrease the cost of these benefits and increase the overall liability.  The level of the Companys debt couldrestrict the Companys operating flexibility and limit the Companys ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs.  As of December 30, 2012, the Company had $493.0 million of debt and capital lease obligations. The Companys level of debt requires the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of theCompanys future cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest, thereby reducing the funds available to the Company for other purposes. The Companys debt can negatively impact the Companys operations by(1) limiting the Companys ability and/or increasing the cost to obtain funding for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; (2) increasing the Companys vulnerability to economic downturns andadverse industry conditions by limiting the Companys ability to react to changing economic and business conditions; and (3) exposing the Company to a risk that a significant decrease in cash flows from operations could make it difficultfor the Company to meet the Companys debt service requirements.  Recent volatility in the financial markets maynegatively impact the Companys ability to access the credit markets.  Capital and credit markets have becomeincreasingly volatile as a result of adverse conditions that caused the failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies. If the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility, it is possible that theCompanys ability to access the credit markets may be limited by these factors at a time when the Company would like or need to do so. If the availability of funds is limited, the Company may incur increased costs associated with borrowing tomeet the Companys requirements.  On September 21, 2011, the Company entered into a $200 million five-year unsecuredrevolving credit agreement ($200 million facility). This replaced the previous $200 million five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement which had been scheduled to mature in 2012. The $200 million facility has a scheduled maturitydate of September 21, 2016. The Company repaid $150 million of Senior Notes which matured in 2012. The Company borrowed from its $200 million facility and its $20 million uncommitted line of credit and used cash flows generated by operations tofund the repayments. As of December 30, 2012, the Company had $170 million available on its $200 million facility. The limitation of availability of funds could have an impact on the Companys ability to refinance maturing debt and/orreact to changing economic and business conditions.   15 Table of ContentsThe Companys credit rating could be negatively impacted by changes to TheCoca-Cola Companys credit rating.  The Companys credit rating could be significantly impacted by capitalmanagement activities of The Coca-Cola Company and/or changes in the credit rating of The Coca-Cola Company. A lower credit rating could significantly increase the Companys interest costs or could have an adverse effect on the Companysability to obtain additional financing at acceptable interest rates or to refinance existing debt.  Changes in legalcontingencies could adversely impact the Companys future profitability.  Changes from expectations for theresolution of outstanding legal claims and assessments could have a material adverse impact on the Companys profitability and financial condition. In addition, the Companys failure to abide by laws, orders or other legal commitmentscould subject the Company to fines, penalties or other damages.  Legislative changes that affect the Companysdistribution, packaging and products could reduce demand for the Companys products or increase the Companys costs.  The Companys business model is dependent on the availability of the Companys various products and packages in multiple channels and locations to better satisfy the needs of the Companyscustomers and consumers. Laws that restrict the Companys ability to distribute products in schools and other venues, as well as laws that require deposits for certain types of packages or those that limit the Companys ability to designnew packages or market certain packages, could negatively impact the financial results of the Company.  In addition, excise orother taxes imposed on the sale of certain of the Companys products by the federal government and certain state and local governments could cause consumers to shift away from purchasing products of the Company. If enacted, such taxes couldmaterially affect the Companys business and financial results, particularly if they were enacted in a form that incorporated them into the shelf prices for the Companys products. Significant additional labeling or warning requirements may inhibit sales of affected products. Various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements relating to the content orperceived adverse health consequences of certain of the Companys products. If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of the Companys major products under current or future environmental or health laws orregulations, they may inhibit sales of such products.  Additional taxes resulting from tax audits could adversely impactthe Companys future profitability.  An assessment of additional taxes resulting from audits of the Companystax filings could have an adverse impact on the Companys profitability, cash flows and financial condition. Natural disasters and unfavorable weather could negatively impact the Companys future profitability. Natural disasters or unfavorable weather conditions in the geographic regions in which the Company does business could have an adverseimpact on the Companys revenue and profitability. For example, prolonged drought conditions in the geographic regions in which the Company does business could lead to restrictions on the use of water, which could adversely affect theCompanys ability to manufacture and distribute products and the Companys cost to do so.  Global climatechange or legal, regulatory, or market responses to such change could adversely impact the Companys future profitability.  The growing political and scientific sentiment is that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are influencing global weather patterns. Changing weatherpatterns, along   16 Table of Contentswith the increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions, could impact the availability or increase the cost of key raw materials that the Company uses to produce its products. Inaddition, the sale of these products can be impacted by weather conditions.  Concern over climate change, including globalwarming, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) began imposing GHG regulations on utilities, refineries and majormanufacturers in 2011. Although the immediate effect was minor, as such regulations apply only to those that are planning to build large new facilities or materially modify existing ones, over the next decade the USEPA plan to extend the scope ofthe GHG regulations to cover virtually all sources of GHGs. Those USEPA regulations or future laws enacted or regulations adopted that directly or indirectly affect the Companys production, distribution, packaging, cost of raw materials,fuel, ingredients and water could all impact the Companys business and financial results.  Issues surroundinglabor relations could adversely impact the Companys future profitability and/or its operating efficiency. Approximately 7% of the Companys employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The inability to renegotiate subsequentagreements on satisfactory terms and conditions could result in work interruptions or stoppages, which could have a material impact on the profitability of the Company. Also, the terms and conditions of existing or renegotiated agreements couldincrease costs, or otherwise affect the Companys ability to fully implement operational changes to improve overall efficiency. One collective bargaining agreement covering approximately .4% of the Companys employees expired during 2012and the Company entered into a new agreement in 2012. Two collective bargaining agreements covering approximately .7% of the Companys employees will expire during 2013.  The Companys ability to change distribution methods and business practices could be negatively affected by United States Coca-Cola bottler system disputes. Litigation filed by some United States bottlers of Coca-Cola products indicates that disagreements may exist within the Coca-Cola bottlersystem concerning distribution methods and business practices. Although the litigation has been resolved, disagreements among various Coca-Cola bottlers could adversely affect the Companys ability to fully implement its business plans in thefuture.  Managements use of estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on reported results. The Companys consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statementsinclude estimates and assumptions by management that impact reported amounts. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.  Changes in accounting standards could affect the Companys reported financial results.  New accounting standards or pronouncements that may become applicable to the Company from time to time, or changes in the interpretation of existing standards and pronouncements could have a significanteffect on the Companys reported results for the affected periods.  Obesity and other health concerns may reducedemand for some of the Companys products.  Consumers, public health officials, public health advocates andgovernment officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the public health consequences associated with obesity, particularly among young people. In February 2013, a group of public health officials and health advocates submitted a petition tothe FDA requesting that agency to regulate the amount of caloric sweeteners in sparkling and other beverages. The FDA has not responded to the petition. In addition, some researchers, health advocates and dietary guidelines are encouraging consumersto reduce the consumption of sugar, including sugar sparkling beverages. Increasing public concern about these issues; possible new taxes and governmental regulations concerning the production, marketing, labeling or availability of theCompanys beverages; and negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against the Company or other companies in the same industry relating to the marketing,   17 Table of Contentslabeling or sale of sugar sparkling beverages may reduce demand for these beverages, which could adversely affect the Companys profitability. The Company has experienced public policy challenges regarding the sale of soft drinks in schools, particularly elementary, middleand high schools.  A number of states have regulations restricting the sale of soft drinks and other foods in schools.Many of these restrictions have existed for several years in connection with subsidized meal programs in schools. The focus has more recently turned to the growing health, nutrition and obesity concerns of todays youth. The impact ofrestrictive legislation, if widely enacted, could have an adverse impact on the Companys products, image and reputation. The concentration of the Companys capital stock ownership with the Harrison family limits other stockholders ability toinfluence corporate matters.  Members of the Harrison family, including the Companys Chairman and Chief ExecutiveOfficer, J. Frank Harrison, III, beneficially own shares of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock representing approximately 85% of the total voting power of the Companys outstanding capital stock. In addition, three members of theHarrison family, including Mr. Harrison, III, serve on the Board of Directors of the Company. As a result, members of the Harrison family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over the Companys management andaffairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by the Companys stockholders. Additionally, as a result of the Harrison familys significant beneficial ownership of the Companys outstanding voting stock, the Company hasrelied on the controlled company exemption from certain corporate governance requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control otherwise favoredby the Companys other stockholders and could depress the stock price. It also limits other stockholders ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, the Company may take actions that the Companys other stockholders maynot view as beneficial.   "
14,COKE,COCA-COLA BTLNG CONS,2012-03-16,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
  In addition to other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Companys business. The Companys business, financial condition orresults of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.  The Company may not be able torespond successfully to changes in the marketplace.  The Company operates in the highly competitive nonalcoholicbeverage industry and faces strong competition from other general and specialty beverage companies. The Companys response to continued and increased customer and competitor consolidations and marketplace competition may result in lower thanexpected net pricing of the Companys products. The Companys ability to gain or maintain the Companys share of sales or gross margins may be limited by the actions of the Companys competitors, which may have advantages insetting their prices due to lower raw material costs. Competitive pressures in the markets in which the Company operates may cause channel and product mix to shift away from more profitable channels and packages. If the Company is unable to maintainor increase volume in higher-margin products and in packages sold through higher-margin channels (e.g., immediate consumption), pricing and gross margins could be adversely affected. The Companys efforts to improve pricing may result in lowerthan expected sales volume.  Acquisitions of bottlers by their franchisors may lead to uncertainty in the Coca-Colabottler system or adversely impact the Company.  The Coca-Cola Company acquired the North American operations ofCoca-Cola Enterprises Inc. in 2010, and the Companys primary competitors were acquired at approximately the same time by their franchisor. These transactions may cause uncertainty within the Coca-Cola bottler system or adversely impact theCompany and its business. At this time, it remains uncertain what the ultimate impact of these transactions will be on the Companys business and financial results.  Changes in how significant customers market or promote the Companys products could reduce revenue.  The Companys revenue is affected by how significant customers market or promote the Companys products. Revenue has been negatively impacted by less aggressive price promotion by some retailersin the future consumption channels over the past several years. If the Companys significant customers change the manner in which they market or promote the Companys products, the Companys revenue and profitability could beadversely impacted.  Changes in the Companys top customer relationships could impact revenues and profitability. The Company is exposed to risks resulting from several large customers that account for a significant portion of itsbottle/can volume and revenue. The Companys two largest customers accounted for approximately 30% of the Companys 2011 bottle/can volume to retail customers and approximately 22% of the Companys total net sales. The loss of one orboth of these customers could adversely affect the Companys results of operations. These customers typically make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand and customer service performance andgenerally do not enter into long-term contracts. In addition, these significant customers may re-evaluate or refine their business practices related to inventories, product displays, logistics or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship.The Companys results of operations could be adversely affected if revenue from one or more of these customers is significantly reduced or if the cost of complying with these customers demands is significant. If receivables from one ormore of these customers become uncollectible, the Companys results of operations may be adversely impacted. One of these customers has announced store closings in the United States, but the Company has not determined if this could affect theCompanys results of operations.   11 Table of ContentsChanges in public and consumer preferences related to nonalcoholic beverages couldreduce demand for the Companys products and reduce profitability.  The Companysbusiness depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of the Companys business depends in large measure on working with the Beverage Companies to meet the changing preferences ofthe broad consumer market. Health and wellness trends throughout the marketplace have resulted in a shift from sugar sparkling beverages to diet sparkling beverages, tea, sports drinks, enhanced water and bottled water over the past several years.Failure to satisfy changing consumer preferences could adversely affect the profitability of the Companys business. The Companys sales can be impacted by the health and stability of the general economy. Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the geographic markets in which theCompany does business, may have the temporary effect of reducing the demand for certain of the Companys products. For example, economic forces may cause consumers to shift away from purchasing higher-margin products and packages sold throughimmediate consumption and other highly profitable channels. Adverse economic conditions could also increase the likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which would increase the risk of uncollectibility of certain accounts. Each ofthese factors could adversely affect the Companys revenue, price realization, gross margins and overall financial condition and operating results.  Miscalculation of the Companys need for infrastructure investment could impact the Companys financial results. Projected requirements of the Companys infrastructure investments may differ from actual levels if the Companys volume growthis not as the Company anticipates. The Companys infrastructure investments are generally long-term in nature; therefore, it is possible that investments made today may not generate the returns expected by the Company due to future changes inthe marketplace. Significant changes from the Companys expected returns on cold drink equipment, fleet, technology and supply chain infrastructure investments could adversely affect the Companys consolidated financial results. The Companys inability to meet requirements under its beverage agreements could result in the loss ofdistribution rights.  Approximately 88% of the Companys bottle/can volume to retail customers in 2011 consistedof products of The Coca-Cola Company, which is the sole supplier of these products or of the concentrates or syrups required to manufacture these products. The remaining 12% of the Companys bottle/can volume to retail customers in 2011consisted of products of other beverage companies and the Companys own products. The Company must satisfy various requirements under its beverage agreements. Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in the loss of distribution rightsfor the respective products.  Material changes in, or the Companys inability to satisfy, the performancerequirements for marketing funding support, or decreases from historic levels of marketing funding support, could reduce the Companys profitability.  Material changes in the performance requirements, or decreases in the levels of marketing funding support historically provided, under marketing programs with The Coca-Cola Company and other beveragecompanies, or the Companys inability to meet the performance requirements for the anticipated levels of such marketing funding support payments, could adversely affect the Companys profitability. The Coca-Cola Company and other beveragecompanies are under no obligation to continue marketing funding support at historic levels.  Changes in The Coca-ColaCompanys and other beverage companies levels of advertising, marketing spending and product innovation could reduce the Companys sales volume.  The Coca-Cola Companys and other beverage companies levels of advertising, marketing spending and product innovation directly impact the Companys operations. While the Company does notbelieve there will be   12 Table of Contentssignificant changes in the levels of marketing and advertising by the Beverage Companies, there can be no assurance that historic levels will continue. The Companys volume growth will alsocontinue to be dependent on product innovation by the Beverage Companies, especially The Coca-Cola Company. Decreases in marketing, advertising and product innovation by the Beverage Companies could adversely impact the profitability of the Company. The inability of the Companys aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Companys purchaserequirements could reduce the Companys profitability.  The Company currently obtains all of its aluminum cansfrom two domestic suppliers and all of its plastic bottles from two domestic cooperatives. The inability of these aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Companys requirements for containers could result in short-term shortagesuntil alternative sources of supply can be located. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate. Failure of the aluminum can or plastic bottlesuppliers to meet the Companys purchase requirements could reduce the Companys profitability.  The inabilityof the Company to offset higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, increased bottle/can volume or reduced expenses could have an adverse impact on the Companys profitability. Raw material costs, including the costs for plastic bottles, aluminum cans and high fructose corn syrup, have been subject to significantprice volatility and have increased in recent years at faster rates than the general rate of inflation. In addition, there are no limits on the prices The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies can charge for concentrate. If the Companycannot offset higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, increased sales volume or reductions in other costs, the Companys profitability could be adversely affected. The consolidation among suppliers of certain of the Companys raw materials could have an adverse impact on the Companysprofitability.  In recent years, there has been consolidation among suppliers of certain of the Companys rawmaterials. The reduction in the number of competitive sources of supply could have an adverse effect upon the Companys ability to negotiate the lowest costs and, in light of the Companys relatively small in-plant raw material inventorylevels, has the potential for causing interruptions in the Companys supply of raw materials.  The increasingreliance on purchased finished goods from external sources makes the Company subject to incremental risks that could have an adverse impact on the Companys profitability. With the introduction of FUZE, Campbell and glacéau products into the Companys portfolio during 2007 and Monster Energyproducts during 2008, the Company has become increasingly reliant on purchased finished goods from external sources versus the Companys internal production. As a result, the Company is subject to incremental risk including, but not limited to,product availability, price variability, product quality and production capacity shortfalls for externally purchased finished goods.  Sustained increases in fuel prices or the inability of the Company to secure adequate supplies of fuel could have an adverse impact on the Companys profitability. The Company uses significant amounts of fuel in the distribution of its products. International or domestic geopolitical or other eventscould impact the supply and cost of fuel and could impact the timely delivery of the Companys products to its customers. While the Company is working to reduce fuel consumption and manage the Companys fuel costs, there can be noassurance that the Company will succeed in limiting the impact on the Companys business or future cost increases. The Company may use derivative instruments to hedge some or all of the Companys projected diesel fuel and unleaded gasolinepurchases. These derivative instruments relate to fuel used in the Companys delivery fleet and other vehicles. Continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce the profitability of the Companys operations.   13 Table of ContentsSustained increases in workers compensation, employment practices and vehicleaccident claims costs could reduce the Companys profitability.  The Company uses various insurance structures tomanage its workers compensation, auto liability, medical and other insurable risks. These structures consist of retentions, deductibles, limits and a diverse group of insurers that serve to strategically transfer and mitigate the financialimpact of losses. Losses are accrued using assumptions and procedures followed in the insurance industry, adjusted for company-specific history and expectations. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there canbe no assurance that the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases. Continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce the profitability of the Companys operations. Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce the Companys profitability. The Companys profitability is substantially affected by the cost of pension retirement benefits, postretirement medical benefits andcurrent employees medical benefits. In recent years, the Company has experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond the Companys control, including increases in health care costs, declinesin investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. A significant decrease in the value of the Companys pension plan assets in 2008 caused a significant increase in pensionplan costs in 2009. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce theprofitability of the Companys operations.  On March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act(PPACA) was signed into law. On March 30, 2010, a companion bill, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Reconciliation Act), was also signed into law. The PPACA and the Reconciliation Act, when takentogether, represent comprehensive health care reform legislation that will likely affect the cost associated with providing employer-sponsored medical plans. The Company is continuing to assess the impact this legislation will have on theCompanys employer-sponsored medical plans. Additionally, the PPACA and the Reconciliation Act include provisions that reduce the tax benefits available to employers that receive Medicare Part D subsidies. Product liability claims brought against the Company or product recalls could negatively affect the Companys business,financial results and brand image.  The Company may be liable if the consumption of the Companys products causesinjury or illness. The Company may also be required to recall products if they become contaminated or are damaged or mislabeled. A significant product liability or other product-related legal judgment against the Company or a widespread recall ofthe Companys products could negatively impact the Companys business, financial results and brand image. Cybersecurity risks - technology failures or cyberattacks on the Companys systems could disrupt the Companys operationsand negatively impact the Companys business.  The Company increasingly relies on information technology systemsto process, transmit and store electronic information. For example, the Companys production and distribution facilities, inventory management and driver handheld devices all utilize information technology to maximize efficiencies and minimizecosts. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communication between personnel, customers and suppliers depends on information technology. Like most companies, the Companys information technology systems may be vulnerable to interruption dueto a variety of events beyond the Companys control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. The Company has technology securityinitiatives and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate the Companys risk to these vulnerabilities, but these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to ensure that the Companys operations are not disrupted. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the profitability of the Company. None of the Companys debt and capital lease obligations of $597.3 million as of January 1, 2012 were subject to changes inshort-term interest rates. The Companys $200 million revolving credit facility is subject to   14 Table of Contentschanges in short-term interest rates. On January 1, 2012, the Company had no outstanding borrowings on the $200 million revolving credit facility. If interest rates increase in the future,it could increase the Companys borrowing cost and it could reduce the Companys overall profitability. The Companys pension and postretirement medical benefits costs are subject to changes in interest rates. A decline in interestrates used to discount the Companys pension and postretirement medical liabilities could increase the cost of these benefits and increase the overall liability.  The level of the Companys debt could restrict the Companys operating flexibility and limit the Companys ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs. As of January 1, 2012, the Company had $597.3 million of debt and capital lease obligations. The Companys level of debtrequires the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of the Companys future cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest, thereby reducing the funds available to the Company for other purposes. The Companys debtcan negatively impact the Companys operations by (1) limiting the Companys ability and/or increasing the cost to obtain funding for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; (2) increasing theCompanys vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions by limiting the Companys ability to react to changing economic and business conditions; and (3) exposing the Company to a risk that a significant decreasein cash flows from operations could make it difficult for the Company to meet the Companys debt service requirements. Recent volatility in the financial markets may negatively impact the Companys ability to access the credit markets. Capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile as a result of adverse conditions that caused the failureand near failure of a number of large financial services companies. If the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility, it is possible that the Companys ability to access the credit markets may be limited by these factors at atime when the Company would like or need to do so. If the availability of funds is limited, the Company may incur increased costs associated with borrowing to meet the Companys requirements. On September 21, 2011, the Company entered intoa new $200 million five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement ($200 million facility). This replaced the existing $200 million five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement scheduled to mature in 2012. The new $200 million facilityhas a scheduled maturity date of September 21, 2016. The Company repaid $176.7 million of debentures which matured in 2009. In 2009, the Company issued $110 million of new senior notes, borrowed from its previous $200 million facility and usedcash flows generated by operations to fund the repayments. As of January 1, 2012, the Company had $200 million available on its $200 million facility. The limitation of availability of funds could have an impact on the Companys ability torefinance maturing debt, including the $150 million Senior Notes due November 2012, and/or react to changing economic and business conditions.  The Companys credit rating could be negatively impacted by changes to The Coca-Cola Companys credit rating. The Companys credit rating could be significantly impacted by capital management activities of The Coca-Cola Company and/or changesin the credit rating of The Coca-Cola Company. A lower credit rating could significantly increase the Companys interest costs or could have an adverse effect on the Companys ability to obtain additional financing at acceptable interestrates or to refinance existing debt.  Changes in legal contingencies could adversely impact the Companys futureprofitability.  Changes from expectations for the resolution of outstanding legal claims and assessments could have amaterial adverse impact on the Companys profitability and financial condition. In addition, the Companys failure to abide by laws, orders or other legal commitments could subject the Company to fines, penalties or other damages. Legislative changes that affect the Companys distribution, packaging and products could reduce demand for theCompanys products or increase the Companys costs.  The Companys business model is dependent on theavailability of the Companys various products and packages in multiple channels and locations to better satisfy the needs of the Companys customers and   15 Table of Contentsconsumers. Laws that restrict the Companys ability to distribute products in schools and other venues, as well as laws that require deposits for certain types of packages or those thatlimit the Companys ability to design new packages or market certain packages, could negatively impact the financial results of the Company.  In addition, excise or other taxes imposed on the sale of certain of the Companys products by the federal government and certain state and local governments could cause consumers to shift away frompurchasing products of the Company. If enacted, such taxes could materially affect the Companys business and financial results, particularly if they were enacted in a form that incorporated them into the shelf prices for the Companysproducts.  Significant additional labeling or warning requirements may inhibit sales of affected products. Various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements relating tothe content or perceived adverse health consequences of certain of the Companys products. If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of the Companys major products under current or future environmental or health lawsor regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products.  Additional taxes resulting from tax audits could adverselyimpact the Companys future profitability.  An assessment of additional taxes resulting from audits of theCompanys tax filings could have an adverse impact on the Companys profitability, cash flows and financial condition.  Natural disasters and unfavorable weather could negatively impact the Companys future profitability.  Natural disasters or unfavorable weather conditions in the geographic regions in which the Company does business could have an adverse impact on the Companys revenue and profitability. For example,prolonged drought conditions in the geographic regions in which the Company does business could lead to restrictions on the use of water, which could adversely affect the Companys ability to manufacture and distribute products and theCompanys cost to do so.  Global climate change or legal, regulatory, or market responses to such change couldadversely impact the Companys future profitability.  The growing political and scientific sentiment is thatincreased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are influencing global weather patterns. Changing weather patterns, along with the increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions, could impactthe availability or increase the cost of key raw materials that the Company uses to produce its products. In addition, the sale of these products can be impacted by weather conditions. Concern over climate change, including global warming, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting greenhousegas (GHG) emissions. For example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) began imposing GHG regulations on utilities, refineries and major manufacturers in 2011.

Those USEPA regulations orfuture laws enacted or regulations adopted that directly or indirectly affect the Companys production, distribution, packaging, cost of raw materials, fuel, ingredients and water could all impact the Companys business and financialresults.  Issues surrounding labor relations could adversely impact the Companys future profitability and/or itsoperating efficiency.  Approximately 7% of the Companys employees are covered by collective bargainingagreements. The inability to renegotiate subsequent agreements on satisfactory terms and conditions could result in work interruptions or stoppages, which could have a material impact on the profitability of the Company. Also, the terms andconditions of existing or renegotiated agreements could increase costs, or otherwise affect the Companys ability to fully implement operational changes to improve overall efficiency. Two collective  16 Table of Contentsbargaining agreements covering approximately 6% of the Companys employees expired during 2011 and the Company entered into new agreements in 2011. One collective bargaining agreementcovering approximately .4% of the Companys employees will expire during 2012.  The Companys ability tochange distribution methods and business practices could be negatively affected by United States Coca-Cola bottler system disputes.  Litigation filed by some United States bottlers of Coca-Cola products indicates that disagreements may exist within the Coca-Cola bottler system concerning distribution methods and business practices.Although the litigation has been resolved, disagreements among various Coca-Cola bottlers could adversely affect the Companys ability to fully implement its business plans in the future. Managements use of estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on reported results. The Companys consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements include estimates andassumptions by management that impact reported amounts. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Changes in accounting standards could affect the Companys reported financial results. New accounting standards or pronouncements that may become applicable to the Company from time to time, or changes in the interpretationof existing standards and pronouncements could have a significant effect on the Companys reported results for the affected periods.  Obesity and other health concerns may reduce demand for some of the Companys products.  Consumers, public health officials and government officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the public health consequences associated with obesity, particularly among young people. In addition,some researchers, health advocates and dietary guidelines are encouraging consumers to reduce the consumption of sugar, including sugar sparkling beverages. Increasing public concern about these issues; possible new taxes and governmentalregulations concerning the marketing, labeling or availability of the Companys beverages; and negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against the Company or other companies in the same industry relating to themarketing, labeling or sale of sugar sparkling beverages may reduce demand for these beverages, which could adversely affect the Companys profitability.  The Company has experienced public policy challenges regarding the sale of soft drinks in schools, particularly elementary, middle and high schools. A number of states have regulations restricting the sale of soft drinks and other foods in schools. Many of these restrictions haveexisted for several years in connection with subsidized meal programs in schools. The focus has more recently turned to the growing health, nutrition and obesity concerns of todays youth. The impact of restrictive legislation, if widelyenacted, could have an adverse impact on the Companys products, image and reputation.  The concentration of theCompanys capital stock ownership with the Harrison family limits other stockholders ability to influence corporate matters.  Members of the Harrison family, including the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, J. Frank Harrison, III, beneficially own shares of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock representingapproximately 85% of the total voting power of the Companys outstanding capital stock. In addition, three members of the Harrison family, including Mr. Harrison, III, serve on the Board of Directors of the Company. As a result, members ofthe Harrison family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over the Companys management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by the Companys stockholders. Additionally, as a result ofthe Harrison familys significant beneficial ownership of the Companys outstanding voting stock, the Company has relied on the controlled company exemption from certain corporate governance requirements of The NASDAQ StockMarket LLC.

The Companys    business, financial condition or results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.    Additional risks and uncertainties, including risks and    10Table of Contents    uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the    Company currently deems immaterial, may also impair its business    and results of operations. The    Company may not be able to respond successfully to changes in    the marketplace.     The Company operates in the highly competitive nonalcoholic    beverage industry and faces strong competition from other    general and specialty beverage companies. The Companys    response to continued and increased customer and competitor    consolidations and marketplace competition may result in lower    than expected net pricing of the Companys products. The    Companys ability to gain or maintain the Companys    share of sales or gross margins may be limited by the actions of    the Companys competitors, which may have advantages in    setting their prices due to lower raw material costs.    Competitive pressures in the markets in which the Company    operates may cause channel and product mix to shift away from    more profitable channels and packages. If the Company is unable    to maintain or increase volume in higher-margin products and in    packages sold through higher-margin channels (e.g., immediate    consumption), pricing and gross margins could be adversely    affected. The Companys efforts to improve pricing may    result in lower than expected sales volume. Recently    completed acquisitions of bottlers by their franchisors may lead    to uncertainty in the    Coca-Cola    bottler system or adversely impact the Company.     The    Coca-Cola    Company recently acquired the North American operations of    Coca-Cola    Enterprises Inc., and the Companys primary competitors    were recently acquired by their franchisor. These transactions    may cause uncertainty within the    Coca-Cola    bottler system or adversely impact the Company and its business.    At this time, it is uncertain whether the transactions will have    a material impact on the Companys business and financial    results. Changes    in how significant customers market or promote the    Companys products could reduce revenue.     The Companys revenue is impacted by how significant    customers market or promote the Companys products. Revenue    has been negatively impacted by less aggressive price promotion    by some retailers in the future consumption channels over the    past several years. If the Companys significant customers    change the manner in which they market or promote the    Companys products, the Companys revenue and    profitability could be adversely impacted. Changes    in the Companys top customer relationships could impact    revenues and profitability.     The Company is exposed to risks resulting from several large    customers that account for a significant portion of its    bottle/can volume and revenue. The Companys two largest    customers accounted for approximately 34% of the Companys    2010 bottle/can volume to retail customers and approximately 24%    of the Companys total net sales. The loss of one or both    of these customers could adversely affect the Companys    results of operations. These customers typically make purchase    decisions based on a combination of price, product quality,    consumer demand and customer service performance and generally    do not enter into long-term contracts. In addition, these    significant customers may re-evaluate or refine their business    practices related to inventories, product displays, logistics or    other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. The    Companys results of operations could be adversely affected    if revenue from one or more of these customers is significantly    reduced or if the cost of complying with these customers    demands is significant. If receivables from one or more of these    customers become uncollectible, the Companys results of    operations may be adversely impacted. Changes    in public and consumer preferences related to nonalcoholic    beverages could reduce demand for the Companys products    and reduce profitability.     The Companys business depends substantially on consumer    tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways.    The success of the Companys business depends in large    measure on working with the Beverage Companies to meet the    changing preferences of the broad consumer market. Health and    wellness trends throughout the marketplace have resulted in a    shift from sugar sparkling beverages to diet sparkling    beverages, tea, sports drinks, enhanced water and bottled water    over the past several years. Failure to satisfy changing    consumer preferences could adversely affect the profitability of    the Companys business.    11Table of ContentsThe    Companys sales can be impacted by the health and stability    of the general economy.     Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as a    recession or economic slowdown in the geographic markets in    which the Company does business, may have the temporary effect    of reducing the demand for certain of the Companys    products. For example, economic forces may cause consumers to    shift away from purchasing higher-margin products and packages    sold through immediate consumption and other highly profitable    channels. Adverse economic conditions could also increase the    likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which    would increase the risk of uncollectibility of certain accounts.    Each of these factors could adversely affect the Companys    revenue, price realization, gross margins and overall financial    condition and operating results. Miscalculation    of the Companys need for infrastructure investment could    impact the Companys financial results.     Projected requirements of the Companys infrastructure    investments may differ from actual levels if the Companys    volume growth is not as the Company anticipates. The    Companys infrastructure investments are generally    long-term in nature; therefore, it is possible that investments    made today may not generate the returns expected by the Company    due to future changes in the marketplace. Significant changes    from the Companys expected returns on cold drink    equipment, fleet, technology and supply chain infrastructure    investments could adversely affect the Companys    consolidated financial results. The    Companys inability to meet requirements under its beverage    agreements could result in the loss of distribution    rights.     Approximately 88% of the Companys bottle/can volume to    retail customers in 2010 consisted of products of The    Coca-Cola    Company, which is the sole supplier of these products or of the    concentrates or syrups required to manufacture these products.    The remaining 12% of the Companys bottle/can volume to    retail customers in 2010 consisted of products of other beverage    companies and the Companys own products. The Company must    satisfy various requirements under its beverage agreements.    Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in the loss    of distribution rights for the respective products. Material    changes in, or the Companys inability to satisfy, the    performance requirements for marketing funding support, or    decreases from historic levels of marketing funding support,    could reduce the Companys profitability.     Material changes in the performance requirements, or decreases    in the levels of marketing funding support historically    provided, under marketing programs with The    Coca-Cola    Company and other beverage companies, or the Companys    inability to meet the performance requirements for the    anticipated levels of such marketing funding support payments,    could adversely affect the Companys profitability. The    Coca-Cola    Company and other beverage companies are under no obligation to    continue marketing funding support at historic levels. Changes    in The    Coca-Cola    Companys and other beverage companies levels of    advertising, marketing spending and product innovation could    reduce the Companys sales volume.     The    Coca-Cola    Companys and other beverage companies levels of    advertising, marketing spending and product innovation directly    impact the Companys operations. While the Company does not    believe there will be significant changes in the levels of    marketing and advertising by the Beverage Companies, there can    be no assurance that historic levels will continue. The    Companys volume growth will also continue to be dependent    on product innovation by the Beverage Companies, especially The    Coca-Cola    Company. Decreases in marketing, advertising and product    innovation by the Beverage Companies could adversely impact the    profitability of the Company. The    inability of the Companys aluminum can or plastic bottle    suppliers to meet the Companys purchase requirements could    reduce the Companys profitability.     The Company currently obtains all of its aluminum cans from two    domestic suppliers and all of its plastic bottles from two    domestic cooperatives. The inability of these aluminum can or    plastic bottle suppliers to meet the    12Table of Contents    Companys requirements for containers could result in    short-term shortages until alternative sources of supply can be    located. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by working    closely with key suppliers and by purchasing business    interruption insurance where appropriate. Failure of the    aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the    Companys purchase requirements could reduce the    Companys profitability. The    inability of the Company to offset higher raw material costs    with higher selling prices, increased bottle/can volume or    reduced expenses could have an adverse impact on the    Companys profitability.     Raw material costs, including the costs for plastic bottles,    aluminum cans and high fructose corn syrup, have been subject to    significant price volatility in recent history. In addition,    there are no limits on the prices The    Coca-Cola    Company and other beverage companies can charge for concentrate.    If the Company cannot offset higher raw material costs with    higher selling prices, increased sales volume or reductions in    other costs, the Companys profitability could be adversely    affected.     In recent years, there has been consolidation among suppliers of    certain of the Companys raw materials. The reduction in    the number of competitive sources of supply could have an    adverse effect upon the Companys ability to negotiate the    lowest costs and, in light of the Companys relatively    small in-plant raw material inventory levels, has the potential    for causing interruptions in the Companys supply of raw    materials.     With the introduction of FUZE, Campbell and glacéau    products into the Companys portfolio during 2007 and    Monster Energy products during 2008, the Company has become    increasingly reliant on purchased finished goods from external    sources versus the Companys internal production. As a    result, the Company is subject to incremental risk including,    but not limited to, product availability, price variability,    product quality and production capacity shortfalls for    externally purchased finished goods. Sustained    increases in fuel prices or the inability of the Company to    secure adequate supplies of fuel could have an adverse impact on    the Companys profitability.     The Company uses significant amounts of fuel in the distribution    of its products. Events such as natural disasters or political    or civil unrest could impact the supply of fuel and could impact    the timely delivery of the Companys products to its    customers. While the Company is working to reduce fuel    consumption, there can be no assurance that the Company will    succeed in limiting future cost increases. Continued upward    pressure in these costs could reduce the profitability of the    Companys operations. Sustained    increases in workers compensation, employment practices    and vehicle accident claims costs could reduce the    Companys profitability.     The Company uses various insurance structures to manage its    workers compensation, auto liability, medical and other    insurable risks. These structures consist of retentions,    deductibles, limits and a diverse group of insurers that serve    to strategically transfer and mitigate the financial impact of    losses. Losses are accrued using assumptions and procedures    followed in the insurance industry, adjusted for    company-specific history and expectations. Although the Company    has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there    can be no assurance that the Company will succeed in limiting    future cost increases. Continued upward pressure in these costs    could reduce the profitability of the Companys operations. Sustained    increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce the    Companys profitability.     The Companys profitability is substantially affected by    the cost of pension retirement benefits, postretirement medical    benefits and current employees medical benefits. In recent    years, the Company has experienced significant increases in    these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond the    Companys control, including increases in health care    costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and    changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related    liabilities. A significant decrease in the value of the    Companys pension plan assets in 2008 caused a significant    increase in pension plan costs in 2009. Although the Company has    actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can    be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost    increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could    reduce the profitability of the Companys operations.    13Table of Contents    On March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable    Care Act (PPACA) was signed into law. On    March 30, 2010, a companion bill, the Health Care and    Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Reconciliation    Act), was also signed into law. The PPACA and the    Reconciliation Act, when taken together, represent comprehensive    healthcare reform legislation that will likely affect the cost    associated with providing employer-sponsored medical plans. At    this point, the Company is in the process of determining the    impact this legislation will have on the Companys    employer-sponsored medical plans. Additionally, the PPACA and    the Reconciliation Act include provisions that reduce the tax    benefits available to employers that receive Medicare    Part D subsidies. Product    liability claims brought against the Company or product recalls    could negatively affect the Companys business, financial    results and brand image.     The Company may be liable if the consumption of the    Companys products causes injury or illness. The Company    may also be required to recall products if they become    contaminated or are damaged or mislabeled. A significant product    liability or other product-related legal judgment against the    Company or a widespread recall of the Companys products    could negatively impact the Companys business, financial    results and brand image. Technology    failures could disrupt the Companys operations and    negatively impact the Companys business.     The Company increasingly relies on information technology    systems to process, transmit and store electronic information.    For example, the Companys production and distribution    facilities, inventory management and driver handheld devices all    utilize information technology to maximize efficiencies and    minimize costs. Furthermore, a significant portion of the    communication between personnel, customers and suppliers depends    on information technology. Like most companies, the    Companys information technology systems may be vulnerable    to a variety of interruptions due to events beyond the    Companys control, including, but not limited to, natural    disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures,    computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. The Company    has technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans    in place to mitigate the Companys risk to these    vulnerabilities, but these measures may not be adequate or    implemented properly to ensure that the Companys    operations are not disrupted. Changes    in interest rates could adversely affect the profitability of    the Company.     None of the Companys debt and capital lease obligations of    $582.3 million as of January 2, 2011 were subject to    changes in short-term interest rates. The Companys    $200 million revolving credit facility    ($200 million facility) is subject to changes    in short-term interest rates. On January 2, 2011, the    Company had no outstanding borrowings on the $200 million    facility. The Companys pension and postretirement medical    benefits costs are subject to changes in interest rates. If    interest rates increase in the future, it could reduce the    Companys overall profitability. The    level of the Companys debt could restrict the    Companys operating flexibility and limit the    Companys ability to incur additional debt to fund future    needs.     As of January 2, 2011, the Company had $582.3 million    of debt and capital lease obligations. The Companys level    of debt requires the Company to dedicate a substantial portion    of the Companys future cash flows from operations to the    payment of principal and interest, thereby reducing the funds    available to the Company for other purposes. The Companys    debt can negatively impact the Companys operations by    (1) limiting the Companys ability    and/or    increasing the cost to obtain funding for working capital,    capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;    (2) increasing the Companys vulnerability to economic    downturns and adverse industry conditions by limiting the    Companys ability to react to changing economic and    business conditions; and (3) exposing the Company to a risk    that a significant decrease in cash flows from operations could    make it difficult for the Company to meet the Companys    debt service requirements.     With the Companys level of debt, access to the capital and    credit markets is vital. The capital and credit markets can, at    times, be volatile and tight as a result of adverse conditions    such as those that caused the failure and    14Table of Contents    near failure of a number of large financial services companies    in late 2008. When the capital and credit markets experience    volatility and the availability of funds is limited, the Company    may incur increased costs associated with borrowing to meet the    Companys requirements. In addition, it is possible that    the Companys ability to access the capital and credit    markets may be limited by these or other factors at a time when    the Company would like, or need, to do so, which could have an    impact on the Companys ability to refinance maturing debt    and/or react    to changing economic and business conditions. The    Companys credit rating could be negatively impacted by    changes to The    Coca-Cola    Companys credit rating.     The Companys credit rating could be significantly impacted    by capital management activities of The    Coca-Cola    Company    and/or    changes in the credit rating of The    Coca-Cola    Company. A lower credit rating could significantly increase the    Companys interest costs or could have an adverse effect on    the Companys ability to obtain additional financing at    acceptable interest rates or to refinance existing debt. Recent    volatility in the financial markets may negatively impact the    Companys ability to access the credit    markets.     Capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile as    a result of adverse conditions that caused the failure and near    failure of a number of large financial services companies. If    the capital and credit markets continue to experience    volatility, it is possible that the Companys ability to    access the credit markets may be limited by these factors at a    time when the Company would like or need to do so. The Company    repaid $176.7 million of debentures which matured in 2009. In    2009, the Company issued $110 million of new senior notes,    borrowed from its $200 million facility and used cash flows    generated by operations to fund the repayments. As of    January 2, 2011, the Company had all $200 million    available on its $200 million facility. The limitation of    availability of funds could have an impact on the Companys    ability to refinance maturing debt, including the    $200 million facility which matures in March 2012 and the    $150 million Senior Notes due November 2012,    and/or react    to changing economic and business conditions. Changes    in legal contingencies could adversely impact the Companys    future profitability.     Changes from expectations for the resolution of outstanding    legal claims and assessments could have a material adverse    impact on the Companys profitability and financial    condition. In addition, the Companys failure to abide by    laws, orders or other legal commitments could subject the    Company to fines, penalties or other damages. Legislative    changes that affect the Companys distribution, packaging    and products could reduce demand for the Companys products    or increase the Companys costs.     The Companys business model is dependent on the    availability of the Companys various products and packages    in multiple channels and locations to better satisfy the needs    of the Companys customers and consumers. Laws that    restrict the Companys ability to distribute products in    schools and other venues, as well as laws that require deposits    for certain types of packages or those that limit the    Companys ability to design new packages or market certain    packages, could negatively impact the financial results of the    Company.     In addition, taxes imposed on the sale of certain of the    Companys products by the federal government and certain    state and local governments could cause consumers to shift away    from purchasing products of the Company. For example, in 2009    some members of the U.S. Congress raised the possibility of    a federal tax on the sale of certain sugar beverages, including    non-diet soft drinks, fruit drinks, teas and flavored waters, to    help pay for the cost of healthcare reform. Some state    governments are also considering similar taxes. If enacted, such    taxes could materially affect the Companys business and    financial results. Significant    additional labeling or warning requirements may inhibit sales of    affected products.     Various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional    product labeling or warning requirements relating to the content    or perceived adverse health consequences of certain of the    Companys products. If these types    15Table of Contents    of requirements become applicable to one or more of the    Companys major products under current or future    environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit    sales of such products. Additional    taxes resulting from tax audits could adversely impact the    Companys future profitability.     An assessment of additional taxes resulting from audits of the    Companys tax filings could have an adverse impact on the    Companys profitability, cash flows and financial condition. Natural    disasters and unfavorable weather could negatively impact the    Companys future profitability.     Natural disasters or unfavorable weather conditions in the    geographic regions in which the Company does business could have    an adverse impact on the Companys revenue and    profitability. For example, prolonged drought conditions in the    geographic regions in which the Company does business could lead    to restrictions on the use of water, which could adversely    affect the Companys ability to manufacture and distribute    products and the Companys cost to do so. Global    climate change or legal, regulatory, or market responses to such    change could adversely impact the Companys future    profitability.     The growing political and scientific sentiment is that increased    concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in    the atmosphere are influencing global weather patterns. Changing    weather patterns, along with the increased frequency or duration    of extreme weather conditions, could impact the availability or    increase the cost of key raw materials that the Company uses to    produce its products. In addition, the sale of these products    can be impacted by weather conditions.     Concern over climate change, including global warming, has led    to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting    greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For example, proposals that    would impose mandatory requirements on GHG emissions continue to    be considered by policy makers in the territories that the    Company operates. Laws enacted that directly or indirectly    affect the Companys production, distribution, packaging,    cost of raw materials, fuel, ingredients and water could all    impact the Companys business and financial results. Issues    surrounding labor relations could adversely impact the    Companys future profitability and/or its operating    efficiency.     Approximately 7% of the Companys employees are covered by    collective bargaining agreements. The inability to renegotiate    subsequent agreements on satisfactory terms and conditions could    result in work interruptions or stoppages, which could have a    material impact on the profitability of the Company. Also, the    terms and conditions of existing or renegotiated agreements    could increase costs, or otherwise affect the Companys    ability to fully implement operational changes to improve    overall efficiency. Two collective bargaining agreements    covering approximately .8% of the Companys employees    expired during 2010 and the Company entered into new agreements    in 2010. Two collective bargaining agreements covering    approximately 6% of the Companys employees will expire    during 2011. The    Companys ability to change distribution methods and    business practices could be negatively affected by United States    Coca-Cola    bottler system disputes.     Litigation filed by some United States bottlers of    Coca-Cola    products indicates that disagreements may exist within the    Coca-Cola    bottler system concerning distribution methods and business    practices. Although the litigation has been resolved,    disagreements among various    Coca-Cola    bottlers could adversely affect the Companys ability to    fully implement its business plans in the future. Managements    use of estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on    reported results.     The Companys consolidated financial statements and    accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements    include estimates and assumptions by management that impact    reported amounts. Actual results could materially differ from    those estimates.    16Table of ContentsChanges    in accounting standards could affect the Companys reported    financial results.     New accounting standards or pronouncements that may become    applicable to the Company from time to time, or changes in the    interpretation of existing standards and pronouncements could    have a significant effect on the Companys reported results    for the affected periods. Obesity    and other health concerns may reduce demand for some of the    Companys products.     Consumers, public health officials and government officials are    becoming increasingly concerned about the public health    consequences associated with obesity, particularly among young    people. In addition, some researchers, health advocates and    dietary guidelines are encouraging consumers to reduce the    consumption of sugar, including sugar sparkling beverages.    Increasing public concern about these issues; possible new taxes    and governmental regulations concerning the marketing, labeling    or availability of the Companys beverages; and negative    publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions    against the Company or other companies in the same industry    relating to the marketing, labeling or sale of sugar sparkling    beverages may reduce demand for these beverages, which could    adversely affect the Companys profitability. The    Company has experienced public policy challenges regarding the    sale of soft drinks in schools, particularly elementary, middle    and high schools.     A number of states have regulations restricting the sale of soft    drinks and other foods in schools. Many of these restrictions    have existed for several years in connection with subsidized    meal programs in schools. The focus has more recently turned to    the growing health, nutrition and obesity concerns of    todays youth. The impact of restrictive legislation, if    widely enacted, could have an adverse impact on the    Companys products, image and reputation. The    concentration of the Companys capital stock ownership with    the Harrison family limits other stockholders ability to    influence corporate matters.     Members of the Harrison family, including the Companys    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, J. Frank    Harrison, III, beneficially own shares of Common Stock and    Class B Common Stock representing approximately 85% of the    total voting power of the Companys outstanding capital    stock. In addition, two members of the Harrison family,    including Mr. Harrison, III, serve on the Board of    Directors of the Company. As a result, members of the Harrison    family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual    control over the Companys management and affairs and over    substantially all matters requiring action by the Companys    stockholders. Additionally, as a result of the Harrison    familys significant beneficial ownership of the    Companys outstanding voting stock, the Company has relied    on the controlled company exemption from certain    corporate governance requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market    LLC. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of    delaying or preventing a change in control otherwise favored by    the Companys other stockholders and could depress the    stock price. It also limits other stockholders ability to    influence corporate matters and, as a result, the Company may    take actions that the Companys other stockholders may not    view as beneficial. "
18,COKE,COCA-COLA BTLNG CONS,2010-03-18,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     In addition to other information in this    Form 10-K,    the following risk factors should be considered carefully in    evaluating the Companys business. The Companys    business, financial condition or results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.    Additional risks and uncertainties, including risks and    uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the    Company currently deems immaterial, may also impair its business    and results of operations. The    Company may not be able to respond successfully to changes in    the marketplace.     The Company operates in the highly competitive nonalcoholic    beverage industry and faces strong competition from other    general and specialty beverage companies. The Companys    response to continued and increased    10Table of Contents    customer and competitor consolidations and marketplace    competition may result in lower than expected net pricing of the    Companys products. The Companys ability to gain or    maintain the Companys share of sales or gross margins may    be limited by the actions of the Companys competitors,    which may have advantages in setting their prices due to lower    raw material costs. Competitive pressures in the markets in    which the Company operates may cause channel and product mix to    shift away from more profitable channels and packages. If the    Company is unable to maintain or increase volume in    higher-margin products and in packages sold through    higher-margin channels (e.g., immediate consumption), pricing    and gross margins could be adversely affected. The    Companys efforts to improve pricing may result in lower    than expected sales volume. Recently    announced and completed acquisitions of bottlers by their    franchisors may lead to uncertainty in the    Coca-Cola    bottler system or adversely impact the Company.     The    Coca-Cola    Company recently announced an agreement to acquire the North    America operations of    Coca-Cola    Enterprises Inc., and the Companys primary competitors    were recently acquired by their franchisor. These transactions    may cause uncertainty within the    Coca-Cola    bottler system or adversely impact the Company and its business.    At this time, it is uncertain whether the transactions will have    a material impact on the Companys business and financial    results. Changes    in how significant customers market or promote the    Companys products could reduce revenue.     The Companys revenue is impacted by how significant    customers market or promote the Companys products. Revenue    has been negatively impacted by less aggressive price promotion    by some retailers in the future consumption channels over the    past several years. If the Companys significant customers    change the manner in which they market or promote the    Companys products, the Companys revenue and    profitability could be adversely impacted. Changes    in public and consumer preferences related to nonalcoholic    beverages could reduce demand for the Companys products    and reduce profitability.     The Companys business depends substantially on consumer    tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways.    The success of the Companys business depends in large    measure on working with the Beverage Companies to meet the    changing preferences of the broad consumer market. Health and    wellness trends throughout the marketplace have resulted in a    shift from sugar sparkling beverages to diet sparkling    beverages, tea, sports drinks, enhanced water and bottled water    over the past several years. Failure to satisfy changing    consumer preferences could adversely affect the profitability of    the Companys business. The    Companys sales can be impacted by the health and stability    of the general economy.     Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as a    recession or economic slowdown in the geographic markets in    which the Company does business, may have the temporary effect    of reducing the demand for certain of the Companys    products. For example, economic forces may cause consumers to    shift away from purchasing higher-margin products and packages    sold through immediate consumption and other highly profitable    channels. Adverse economic conditions could also increase the    likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which    would increase the risk of uncollectibility of certain accounts.    Each of these factors could adversely affect the Companys    revenue, price realization, gross margins and overall financial    condition and operating results. Miscalculation    of the Companys need for infrastructure investment could    impact the Companys financial results.     Projected requirements of the Companys infrastructure    investments may differ from actual levels if the Companys    volume growth is not as the Company anticipates. The    Companys infrastructure investments are generally    long-term in nature; therefore, it is possible that investments    made today may not generate the returns expected by the Company    due to future changes in the marketplace. Significant changes    from the Companys expected returns on cold drink    equipment, fleet, technology and supply chain infrastructure    investments could adversely affect the Companys    consolidated financial results.    11Table of ContentsThe    Companys inability to meet requirements under its beverage    agreements could result in the loss of distribution    rights.     Approximately 88% of the Companys bottle/can volume to    retail customers in 2009 consisted of products of The    Coca-Cola    Company, which is the sole supplier of these products or of the    concentrates or syrups required to manufacture these products.    The remaining 12% of the Companys bottle/can volume to    retail customers in 2009 consisted of products of other beverage    companies and the Companys own products. The Company must    satisfy various requirements under its beverage agreements.    Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in the loss    of distribution rights for the respective products. Material    changes in, or the Companys inability to satisfy, the    performance requirements for marketing funding support, or    decreases from historic levels of marketing funding support,    could reduce the Companys profitability.     Material changes in the performance requirements, or decreases    in the levels of marketing funding support historically    provided, under marketing programs with The    Coca-Cola    Company and other beverage companies, or the Companys    inability to meet the performance requirements for the    anticipated levels of such marketing funding support payments,    could adversely affect the Companys profitability. The    Coca-Cola    Company and other beverage companies are under no obligation to    continue marketing funding support at historic levels. Changes    in The    Coca-Cola    Companys and other beverage companies levels of    advertising, marketing spending and product innovation could    reduce the Companys sales volume.     The    Coca-Cola    Companys and other beverage companies levels of    advertising, marketing spending and product innovation directly    impact the Companys operations. While the Company does not    believe there will be significant changes in the levels of    marketing and advertising by the Beverage Companies, there can    be no assurance that historic levels will continue. In addition,    if the volume of sugar sparkling beverages continues to decline,    the Companys volume growth will continue to be dependent    on product innovation by the Beverage Companies, especially The    Coca-Cola    Company. Decreases in marketing, advertising and product    innovation by the Beverage Companies could adversely impact the    profitability of the Company. The    inability of the Companys aluminum can or plastic bottle    suppliers to meet the Companys purchase requirements could    reduce the Companys profitability.     The Company currently obtains all of its aluminum cans from two    domestic suppliers and all of its plastic bottles from two    domestic cooperatives. The inability of these aluminum can or    plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Companys requirements    for containers could result in short-term shortages until    alternative sources of supply can be located. The Company    attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key    suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance    where appropriate. Failure of the aluminum can or plastic bottle    suppliers to meet the Companys purchase requirements could    reduce the Companys profitability. The    inability of the Company to offset higher raw material costs    with higher selling prices, increased bottle/can volume or    reduced expenses could have an adverse impact on the    Companys profitability.     Raw material costs, including the costs for plastic bottles,    aluminum cans and high fructose corn syrup, have been subject to    significant price volatility in recent history. In addition,    there are no limits on the prices The    Coca-Cola    Company and other beverage companies can charge for concentrate.    If the Company cannot offset higher raw material costs with    higher selling prices, increased sales volume or reductions in    other costs, the Companys profitability could be adversely    affected.     In recent years, there has been consolidation among suppliers of    certain of the Companys raw materials. The reduction in    the number of competitive sources of supply could have an    adverse effect upon the Companys ability to negotiate the    lowest costs and, in light of the Companys relatively    small in-plant raw material inventory levels, has the potential    for causing interruptions in the Companys supply of raw    materials.    12Table of Contents    With the introduction of FUZE, Campbell and glacéau    products into the Companys portfolio during 2007 and    Monster Energy products during 2008, the Company is becoming    increasingly reliant on purchased finished goods from external    sources versus the Companys internal production. As a    result, the Company is subject to incremental risk including,    but not limited to, product availability, price variability,    product quality and production capacity shortfalls for    externally purchased finished goods. Sustained    increases in fuel prices or the inability of the Company to    secure adequate supplies of fuel could have an adverse impact on    the Companys profitability.     The Company uses significant amounts of fuel in the distribution    of its products. Events such as natural disasters could impact    the supply of fuel and could impact the timely delivery of the    Companys products to its customers. While the Company is    working to reduce fuel consumption, there can be no assurance    that the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases.    Continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce the    profitability of the Companys operations. Sustained    increases in workers compensation, employment practices    and vehicle accident claims costs could reduce the    Companys profitability.     The Company uses various insurance structures to manage its    workers compensation, auto liability, medical and other    insurable risks. These structures consist of retentions,    deductibles, limits and a diverse group of insurers that serve    to strategically transfer and mitigate the financial impact of    losses. Losses are accrued using assumptions and procedures    followed in the insurance industry, adjusted for    company-specific history and expectations. Although the Company    has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there    can be no assurance that the Company will succeed in limiting    future cost increases. Continued upward pressure in these costs    could reduce the profitability of the Companys operations. Sustained    increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce the    Companys profitability.     The Companys profitability is substantially affected by    the cost of pension retirement benefits, postretirement medical    benefits and current employees medical benefits. In recent    years, the Company has experienced significant increases in    these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond the    Companys control, including increases in health care    costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and    changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related    liabilities. A significant decrease in the value of the    Companys pension plan assets in 2008 caused a significant    increase in pension plan costs in 2009. Although the Company has    actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can    be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost    increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could    reduce the profitability of the Companys operations. Product    liability claims brought against the Company or product recalls    could negatively affect the Companys business, financial    results and brand image.     The Company may be liable if the consumption of the    Companys products causes injury or illness. The Company    may also be required to recall products if they become    contaminated or are damaged or mislabeled. A significant product    liability or other product-related legal judgment against the    Company or a widespread recall of the Companys products    could negatively impact the Companys business, financial    results and brand image. Technology    failures could disrupt the Companys operations and    negatively impact the Companys business.     The Company increasingly relies on information technology    systems to process, transmit and store electronic information.    For example, the Companys production and distribution    facilities, inventory management and driver handheld devices all    utilize information technology to maximize efficiencies and    minimize costs. Furthermore, a significant portion of the    communication between personnel, customers and suppliers depends    on information technology. Like most companies, the    Companys information technology systems may be vulnerable    to a variety of interruptions due to events beyond the    Companys control, including, but not limited to, natural    disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures,    computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. The Company    has    13Table of Contents    technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in    place to mitigate the Companys risk to these    vulnerabilities, but these measures may not be adequate or    implemented properly to ensure that the Companys    operations are not disrupted. Changes    in interest rates could adversely affect the profitability of    the Company.     Approximately 7.3% of the Companys debt and capital lease    obligations of $601.0 million as of January 3, 2010    was subject to changes in short-term interest rates. In    addition, the Companys pension and postretirement medical    benefits costs are subject to changes in interest rates. If    interest rates increase in the future, it could reduce the    Companys overall profitability. The    level of the Companys debt could restrict the    Companys operating flexibility and limit the    Companys ability to incur additional debt to fund future    needs.     As of January 3, 2010, the Company had $601.0 million    of debt and capital lease obligations. The Companys level    of debt requires the Company to dedicate a substantial portion    of the Companys future cash flows from operations to the    payment of principal and interest, thereby reducing the funds    available to the Company for other purposes. The Companys    debt can negatively impact the Companys operations by    (1) limiting the Companys ability    and/or    increasing the cost to obtain funding for working capital,    capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;    (2) increasing the Companys vulnerability to economic    downturns and adverse industry conditions by limiting the    Companys ability to react to changing economic and    business conditions; and (3) exposing the Company to a risk    that a significant decrease in cash flows from operations could    make it difficult for the Company to meet the Companys    debt service requirements.     With the Companys level of debt, access to the capital and    credit markets is vital. The capital and credit markets can, at    times, be volatile and tight as a result of adverse conditions    such as those that caused the failure and near failure of a    number of large financial service companies in late 2008. When    the capital and credit markets experience volatility and the    availability of funds is limited, the Company may incur    increased costs associated with borrowing to meet the    Companys requirements. In addition, it is possible that    the Companys ability to access the capital and credit    markets may be limited by these or other factors at a time when    the Company would like, or need, to do so, which could have an    impact on the Companys ability to refinance maturing debt    and/or react    to changing economic and business conditions. The    Companys credit rating could be negatively impacted by The    Coca-Cola    Company.     The Companys credit rating could be significantly impacted    by capital management activities of The    Coca-Cola    Company    and/or    changes in the credit rating of The    Coca-Cola    Company. A lower credit rating could significantly increase the    Companys interest costs or could have an adverse effect on    the Companys ability to obtain additional financing at    acceptable interest rates or to refinance existing debt. Recent    volatility in the financial market may negatively impact the    Companys ability to access the credit    markets.     Capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile as    a result of adverse conditions that have caused the failure and    near failure of a number of large financial services companies.    If the capital and credit markets continue to experience    volatility and availability of funds remains limited, it is    possible that the Companys ability to access the credit    markets may be limited by these factors at a time when the    Company would like, or need to do so. The Company repaid    $176.7 million of debentures which became due in 2009. The    Company issued $110 million of new senior notes, borrowed    from its $200 million revolving credit facility    ($200 million facility) and used cash flows    generated by operations to fund the repayments. As of    January 3, 2010, the Company had $185 million    available on its $200 million facility. The limitation of    availability of funds could have an impact on the Companys    ability to refinance maturing debt    and/or react    to changing economic and business conditions.    14Table of ContentsChanges    in legal contingencies could adversely impact the Companys    future profitability.     Changes from expectations for the resolution of outstanding    legal claims and assessments could have a material adverse    impact on the Companys profitability and financial    condition. In addition, the Companys failure to abide by    laws, orders or other legal commitments could subject the    Company to fines, penalties or other damages. Legislative    changes that affect the Companys distribution, packaging    and products could reduce demand for the Companys products    or increase the Companys costs.     The Companys business model is dependent on the    availability of the Companys various products and packages    in multiple channels and locations to better satisfy the needs    of the Companys customers and consumers. Laws that    restrict the Companys ability to distribute products in    schools and other venues, as well as laws that require deposits    for certain types of packages or those that limit the    Companys ability to design new packages or market certain    packages, could negatively impact the financial results of the    Company.     In addition, taxes imposed on the sale of certain of the    Companys products by the federal government and certain    state and local governments could cause consumers to shift away    from purchasing products of the Company. For example, in 2009    some members of the U.S. Congress raised the possibility of    a federal tax on the sale of certain sugar beverages, including    non-diet soft drinks, fruit drinks, teas and flavored waters, to    help pay for the cost of healthcare reform. Some state    governments are also considering similar taxes. If enacted, such    taxes could materially affect the Companys business and    financial results. Additional    taxes resulting from tax audits could adversely impact the    Companys future profitability.     An assessment of additional taxes resulting from audits of the    Companys tax filings could have an adverse impact on the    Companys profitability, cash flows and financial condition. Natural    disasters and unfavorable weather could negatively impact the    Companys future profitability.     Natural disasters or unfavorable weather conditions in the    geographic regions in which the Company does business could have    an adverse impact on the Companys revenue and    profitability. For example, prolonged drought conditions in the    geographic regions in which the Company does business could lead    to restrictions on the use of water, which could adversely    affect the Companys ability to manufacture and distribute    products and the Companys cost to do so. Global    climate change or legal, regulatory, or market responses to such    change could adversely impact the Companys future    profitability.     The growing political and scientific sentiment is that increased    concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in    the atmosphere are influencing global weather patterns. Changing    weather patterns, along with the increased frequency or duration    of extreme weather conditions, could impact the availability or    increase the cost of key raw materials that the Company uses to    produce its products. In addition, the sale of these products    can be impacted by weather conditions.     Concern over climate change, including global warming, has led    to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting    greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For example, proposals that    would impose mandatory requirements on GHG emissions continue to    be considered by policy makers in the territories that the    Company operates. Laws enacted that directly or indirectly    affect the Companys production, distribution, packaging,    cost of raw materials, fuel, ingredients and water could all    impact the Companys business and financial results. Issues    surrounding labor relations could adversely impact the    Companys future profitability and/or its operating    efficiency.     Approximately 7% of the Companys employees are covered by    collective bargaining agreements. The inability to renegotiate    subsequent agreements on satisfactory terms and conditions could    result in work interruptions or stoppages, which could have a    material impact on the profitability of the Company. Also, the    terms and conditions of existing or renegotiated agreements    could increase costs, or otherwise affect the Companys    ability to    15Table of Contents    fully implement operational changes to improve overall    efficiency. One collective bargaining agreement covering    approximately .5% of the Companys employees expired during    2009 and the Company entered into a new agreement during 2009.    Two collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 1%    of the Companys employees will expire during 2010. The    Companys ability to change distribution methods and    business practices could be negatively affected by United States    bottler system disputes.     Litigation filed by some United States bottlers of    Coca-Cola    products indicates that disagreements may exist within the    Coca-Cola    bottler system concerning distribution methods and business    practices. Although the litigation has been resolved,    disagreements among various    Coca-Cola    bottlers could adversely affect the Companys ability to    fully implement its business plans in the future. Managements    use of estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on    reported results.     The Companys consolidated financial statements and    accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements    include estimates and assumptions by management that impact    reported amounts. Actual results could materially differ from    those estimates. Obesity    and other health concerns may reduce demand for some of the    Companys products.     Consumers, public health officials and government officials are    becoming increasingly concerned about the public health    consequences associated with obesity, particularly among young    people. In addition, some researchers, health advocates and    dietary guidelines are encouraging consumers to reduce the    consumption of sugar sparkling beverages. Increasing public    concern about these issues; possible new taxes and governmental    regulations concerning the marketing, labeling or availability    of the Companys beverages; and negative publicity    resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against the    Company or other companies in the same industry relating to the    marketing, labeling or sale of sugar sparkling beverages may    reduce demand for these beverages, which could affect the    Companys profitability. The    Company has experienced public policy challenges regarding the    sale of soft drinks in schools, particularly elementary, middle    and high schools.     A number of states have regulations restricting the sale of soft    drinks and other foods in schools. Many of these restrictions    have existed for several years in connection with subsidized    meal programs in schools. The focus has more recently turned to    the growing health, nutrition and obesity concerns of    todays youth. The impact of restrictive legislation, if    widely enacted, could have an adverse impact on the    Companys products, image and reputation. The    concentration of the Companys capital stock ownership with    the Harrison family limits other stockholders ability to    influence corporate matters.     Members of the Harrison family, including the Companys    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, J. Frank    Harrison, III, beneficially own shares of Common Stock and    Class B Common Stock representing approximately 85% of the    total voting power of the Companys outstanding capital    stock. In addition, two members of the Harrison family,    including Mr. Harrison, III, serve on the Board of    Directors of the Company. As a result, members of the Harrison    family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual    control over the Companys management and affairs and over    substantially all matters requiring action by the Companys    stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the    effect of delaying or preventing a change in control otherwise    favored by the Companys other stockholders and could    depress the stock price.     Additionally, as a result of the Harrison familys    significant beneficial ownership of the Companys    outstanding voting stock, the Company has relied on the    controlled company exemption from certain corporate    governance requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. This    concentration of control limits other stockholders ability    to influence corporate matters and, as a result, the Company may    take actions that the Companys stockholders do not view as    beneficial.    16Table of Contents"

The Companys    business, financial condition or results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.    Additional risks and uncertainties, including risks and    10Table of Contents    uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the    Company currently deems immaterial, may also impair its business    and results of operations. The    Company may not be able to respond successfully to changes in    the marketplace.     The Company operates in the highly competitive nonalcoholic    beverage industry and faces strong competition from other    general and specialty beverage companies. The Companys    response to continued and increased customer and competitor    consolidations and marketplace competition may result in lower    than expected net pricing of the Companys products. The    Companys ability to gain or maintain the Companys    share of sales or gross margins may be limited by the actions of    the Companys competitors, which may have advantages in    setting their prices due to lower raw material costs.    Competitive pressures in the markets in which the Company    operates may cause channel and product mix to shift away from    more profitable channels and packages. If the Company is unable    to maintain or increase volume in higher-margin products and in    packages sold through higher-margin channels (e.g., immediate    consumption), pricing and gross margins could be adversely    affected. The Companys efforts to improve pricing may    result in lower than expected sales volume. Changes    in how significant customers market or promote the    Companys products could reduce revenue.     The Companys revenue is impacted by how significant    customers market or promote the Companys products. Revenue    has been negatively impacted by less aggressive price promotion    by some retailers in the future consumption channels over the    past several years. If the Companys significant customers    change the manner in which they market or promote the    Companys products, the Companys revenue and    profitability could be adversely impacted. Changes    in public and consumer preferences related to nonalcoholic    beverages could reduce demand for the Companys products    and reduce profitability.     The Companys business depends substantially on consumer    tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways.    The success of the Companys business depends in large    measure on working with the Beverage Companies to meet the    changing preferences of the broad consumer market. Health and    wellness trends throughout the marketplace have resulted in a    shift from sugar sparkling beverages to diet sparkling    beverages, tea, sports drinks, enhanced water and bottled water    over the past several years. Failure to satisfy changing    consumer preferences could adversely affect the profitability of    the Companys business. The    Companys sales can be impacted by the health and stability    of the general economy.     Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as a    recession or economic slowdown in the geographic markets in    which the Company does business, may have the temporary effect    of reducing the demand for certain of the Companys    products. For example, economic forces may cause consumers to    shift away from purchasing higher-margin products and packages    sold through immediate consumption and other highly profitable    channels. Adverse economic conditions could also increase the    likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which    would increase the risk of uncollectibility of certain accounts.    Each of these factors could adversely affect the Companys    revenue, price realization, gross margins and overall financial    condition and operating results. Miscalculation    of the Companys need for infrastructure investment could    impact the Companys financial results.     Projected requirements of the Companys infrastructure    investments may differ from actual levels if the Companys    volume growth is not as the Company anticipates. The    Companys infrastructure investments are generally    long-term in nature; therefore, it is possible that investments    made today may not generate the returns expected by the Company    due to future changes in the marketplace. Significant changes    from the Companys expected returns on cold drink    equipment, fleet, technology and supply chain infrastructure    investments could adversely affect the Companys    consolidated financial results.    11Table of ContentsThe    Companys inability to meet requirements under its beverage    agreements could result in the loss of distribution    rights.     Approximately 89% of the Companys bottle/can volume to    retail customers consists of products of The    Coca-Cola    Company, which is the sole supplier of these products or of the    concentrates or syrups required to manufacture these products.    The remaining 11% of the Companys bottle/can volume to    retail customers consists of products of other beverage    companies and the Companys own products. The Company must    satisfy various requirements under its beverage agreements.    Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in the loss    of distribution rights for the respective products. Material    changes in, or the Companys inability to satisfy, the    performance requirements for marketing funding support, or    decreases from historic levels of marketing funding support,    could reduce the Companys profitability.     Material changes in the performance requirements, or decreases    in the levels of marketing funding support historically    provided, under marketing programs with The    Coca-Cola    Company and other beverage companies, or the Companys    inability to meet the performance requirements for the    anticipated levels of such marketing funding support payments,    could adversely affect the Companys profitability. The    Coca-Cola    Company and other beverage companies are under no obligation to    continue marketing funding support at historic levels. Changes    in The    Coca-Cola    Companys and other beverage companies levels of    advertising, marketing spending and product innovation could    reduce the Companys sales volume.     The    Coca-Cola    Companys and other beverage companies levels of    advertising, marketing spending and product innovation directly    impact the Companys operations. While the Company does not    believe there will be significant changes in the levels of    marketing and advertising by the Beverage Companies, there can    be no assurance that historic levels will continue. In addition,    if the volume of sugar sparkling beverages continues to decline,    the Companys volume growth will continue to be dependent    on product innovation by the Beverage Companies, especially The    Coca-Cola    Company. Decreases in marketing, advertising and product    innovation by the Beverage Companies could adversely impact the    profitability of the Company. The    inability of the Companys aluminum can or plastic bottle    suppliers to meet the Companys purchase requirements could    reduce the Companys profitability.     The Company currently obtains all of its aluminum cans from one    domestic supplier and all of its plastic bottles from two    domestic cooperatives. The inability of these aluminum can or    plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Companys requirements    for containers could result in short-term shortages until    alternative sources of supply can be located. The Company    attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key    suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance    where appropriate. Failure of the aluminum can or plastic bottle    suppliers to meet the Companys purchase requirements could    reduce the Companys profitability. The    inability of the Company to offset higher raw material costs    with higher selling prices, increased    bottle/can    volume or reduced expenses could have an adverse impact on the    Companys profitability.     Packaging costs, primarily plastic bottles, and high fructose    corn syrup cost increased significantly in 2008. In addition,    there are no limits on the prices The    Coca-Cola    Company and other beverage companies can charge for concentrate.    If the Company cannot offset higher raw material costs with    higher selling prices, increased sales volume or reductions in    other costs, the Companys profitability could be adversely    affected.     The Company primarily uses supplier pricing agreements and may,    at times, use derivative financial instruments to manage the    volatility and market risk with respect to certain commodities.    Generally, these hedging instruments establish the purchase    price for these commodities in advance of the time of delivery.    As such, it is possible that these hedging instruments may lock    the Company into prices that are ultimately greater than the    actual market price at the time of delivery.    12Table of Contents    In recent years, there has been consolidation among suppliers of    certain of the Companys raw materials. The reduction in    the number of competitive sources of supply could have an    adverse effect upon the Companys ability to negotiate the    lowest costs and, in light of the Companys relatively    small in-plant raw material inventory levels, has the potential    for causing interruptions in the Companys supply of raw    materials.     With the introduction of FUZE, Campbell and glacéau    products into the Companys portfolio during 2007 and    Monster Energy products during 2008, the Company is becoming    increasingly reliant on purchased finished goods from external    sources versus the Companys internal production. As a    result, the Company is subject to incremental risk including,    but not limited to, product availability, price variability,    product quality and production capacity shortfalls for    externally purchased finished goods. Sustained    increases in fuel prices or the inability of the Company to    secure adequate supplies of fuel could have an adverse impact on    the Companys profitability.     The Company has experienced significant increases in fuel prices    as a result primarily of macro-economic factors beyond the    Companys control. The Company uses significant amounts of    fuel in the distribution of its products. Events such as natural    disasters could impact the supply of fuel and could impact the    timely delivery of the Companys products to its customers.    While the Company is working to reduce fuel consumption, there    can be no assurance that the Company will succeed in limiting    future cost increases. Continued upward pressure in these costs    could reduce the profitability of the Companys operations. Sustained    increases in workers compensation, employment practices    and vehicle accident costs could reduce the Companys    profitability.     The Company is generally self-insured for the costs of    workers compensation, employment practices and vehicle    accident claims. Losses are accrued using assumptions and    procedures followed in the insurance industry, adjusted for    company-specific history and expectations. Although the Company    has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there    can be no assurance that the Company will succeed in limiting    future cost increases. Continued upward pressure in these costs    could reduce the profitability of the Companys operations. Sustained    increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce the    Companys profitability.     The Companys profitability is substantially affected by    the cost of pension retirement benefits, postretirement medical    benefits and current employees medical benefits. In recent    years, the Company has experienced significant increases in    these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond the    Companys control, including increases in health care    costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and    changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related    liabilities. A significant decrease in the value of the    Companys pension plan assets in 2008 will cause a    significant increase in pension plan costs in 2009. Although the    Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs,    there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting    future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these    costs could reduce the profitability of the Companys    operations. Product    liability claims brought against the Company or product recalls    could negatively affect the Companys business, financial    results and brand image.     The Company may be liable if the consumption of the    Companys products causes injury or illness. The Company    may also be required to recall products if they become    contaminated or are damaged or mislabeled. A significant product    liability or other product-related legal judgment against the    Company or a widespread recall of the Companys products    could negatively impact the Companys business, financial    results and brand image. Technology    failures could disrupt the Companys operations and    negatively impact the Companys business.     The Company increasingly relies on information technology    systems to process, transmit and store electronic information.    For example, the Companys production and distribution    facilities, inventory management and driver handheld devices all    utilize information technology to maximize efficiencies and    minimize costs. Furthermore, a significant portion of the    communication between personnel, customers and suppliers depends    on information    13Table of Contents    technology. Like most companies, the Companys information    technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of    interruptions due to events beyond the Companys control,    including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist    attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers    and other security issues. The Company has technology security    initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate the    Companys risk to these vulnerabilities, but these measures    may not be adequate or implemented properly to ensure that the    Companys operations are not disrupted. Changes    in interest rates could adversely affect the profitability of    the Company.     Approximately 6.3% of the Companys debt and capital lease    obligations of $669.1 million as of December 28, 2008    was subject to changes in short-term interest rates. In    addition, the Companys pension and postretirement medical    benefits costs are subject to changes in interest rates. If    interest rates increase in the future, there can be no assurance    that future increases in interest expense will not reduce the    Companys overall profitability. The    Companys credit rating could be negatively impacted by The    Coca-Cola    Company.     The Companys credit rating could be significantly impacted    by capital management activities of The    Coca-Cola    Company    and/or    changes in the credit rating of The    Coca-Cola    Company. A lower credit rating could significantly increase the    Companys interest costs or could have an adverse effect on    the Companys ability to obtain additional financing at    acceptable interest rates or to refinance existing debt. Changes    in legal contingencies could adversely impact the Companys    future profitability.     Changes from expectations for the resolution of outstanding    legal claims and assessments could have a material adverse    impact on the Companys profitability and financial    condition. In addition, the Companys failure to abide by    laws, orders or other legal commitments could subject the    Company to fines, penalties or other damages. Legislative    changes that affect the Companys distribution and    packaging could reduce demand for the Companys products or    increase the Companys costs.     The Companys business model is dependent on the    availability of the Companys various products and packages    in multiple channels and locations versus those of the    Companys competitors to better satisfy the needs of the    Companys customers and consumers. Laws that restrict the    Companys ability to distribute products in schools and    other venues, as well as laws that require deposits for certain    types of packages or those that limit the Companys ability    to design new packages or market certain packages, could    negatively impact the financial results of the Company. In    addition, taxes imposed by individual states and localities    could cause consumers to shift away from purchasing products of    the Company. Additional    taxes resulting from tax audits could adversely impact the    Companys future profitability.     An assessment of additional taxes resulting from audits of the    Companys tax filings could have an adverse impact on the    Companys profitability, cash flows and financial condition. Natural    disasters and unfavorable weather could negatively impact the    Companys future profitability.     Natural disasters or unfavorable weather conditions in the    geographic regions in which the Company does business could have    an adverse impact on the Companys revenue and    profitability. For example, prolonged drought conditions in the    geographic regions in which the Company does business could lead    to restrictions on the use of water, which could adversely    affect the Companys ability to manufacture and distribute    products and the Companys cost to do so. Issues    surrounding labor relations could adversely impact the    Companys future profitability and/or its operating    efficiency.     Approximately 7% of the Companys employees are covered by    collective bargaining agreements. The inability to renegotiate    subsequent agreements on satisfactory terms and conditions could    result in work    14Table of Contents    interruptions or stoppages, which could have a material impact    on the profitability of the Company. Also, the terms and    conditions of existing or renegotiated agreements could increase    costs, or otherwise affect the Companys ability to fully    implement operational changes to improve overall efficiency. Two    collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 5% of    the Companys employees expired during 2008 and the Company    entered into new agreements during 2008. One collective    bargaining agreement covering approximately .5% of the    Companys employees expires during 2009. The    Companys ability to change distribution methods and    business practices could be negatively affected by United States    bottler system disputes.     Litigation filed by some United States bottlers of    Coca-Cola    products indicates that disagreements may exist within the    Coca-Cola    bottler system concerning distribution methods and business    practices. Although the litigation has been resolved,    disagreements among various    Coca-Cola    bottlers could adversely affect the Companys ability to    fully implement its business plans in the future. Managements    use of estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on    reported results.     The Companys consolidated financial statements and    accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements    include estimates and assumptions by management that impact    reported amounts. Actual results could materially differ from    those estimates. The    Company has experienced public policy challenges regarding the    sale of soft drinks in schools, particularly elementary, middle    and high schools.     A number of states have regulations restricting the sale of soft    drinks and other foods in schools. Many of these restrictions    have existed for several years in connection with subsidized    meal programs in schools. The focus has more recently turned to    the growing health, nutrition and obesity concerns of    todays youth. The impact of restrictive legislation, if    widely enacted, could have an adverse impact on the    Companys products, image and reputation. Recent    volatility in the financial market may negatively impact the    Companys ability to access the credit    markets.     Recently the capital and credit markets have become increasingly    volatile as a result of adverse conditions that have caused the    failure and near failure of a number of large financial services    companies. If the capital and credit markets continue to    experience volatility and availability of funds remains limited,    it is possible that the Companys ability to access the    credit markets may be limited by these factors at a time when    the Company would like, or need to do so. The Company has debt    maturities of $119.3 million in May 2009 and    $57.4 million in July 2009. The Company anticipates using    cash flow generated from operations, its $200 million    revolving credit facility ($200 million    facility) and potentially other sources, including bank    borrowings or issuance of debentures or equity securities, to    repay or refinance these debt maturities. The Company currently    has, and anticipates it will continue to have, capacity under    its $200 million facility and cash on hand to repay or    refinance these debt maturities in the event other financing    sources are not available. The limitation of availability of    funds could have an impact on the Companys ability to    refinance the maturing debt    and/or react    to changing economic and business conditions. The    concentration of the Companys capital stock ownership with    the Harrison family limits other stockholders ability to    influence corporate matters.     Members of the Harrison family, including the Companys    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, J. Frank    Harrison, III, beneficially own shares of Common Stock and    Class B Common Stock representing approximately 85% of the    total voting power of the Companys outstanding capital    stock. In addition, two members of the Harrison family,    including Mr. Harrison, III, serve on the Board of    Directors of the Company. As a result, members of the Harrison    family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual    control over the Companys management and affairs and over    substantially all matters requiring action by the Companys    stockholders. This concentration of    15Table of Contents    ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a    change in control otherwise favored by the Companys other    stockholders and could depress the stock price.     Additionally, as a result of the Harrison familys    significant beneficial ownership of the Companys    outstanding voting stock, the Company has relied on the    controlled company exemption from certain corporate    governance requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. This    concentration of control limits other stockholders ability    to influence corporate matters and, as a result, the Company may    take actions that the Companys stockholders do not view as    beneficial. "
4,COKE,COCA-COLA BTLNG CONS,2008-03-13,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     In addition to other information in this    Form 10-K,    the following risk factors should be considered carefully in    evaluating the Companys business. The Companys    business, financial condition or results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.    Additional risks and uncertainties, including risks and    uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the    Company currently deems immaterial, may also impair its business    and results of operations. The    Company may not be able to respond successfully to changes in    the marketplace.     The Company operates in the highly competitive nonalcoholic    beverage industry and faces strong competition from other    general and specialty beverage companies. The Companys    response to continued and increased customer and competitor    consolidations and marketplace competition may result in lower    than expected net pricing of the Companys products. The    Companys ability to gain or maintain the Companys    share of sales or gross margins may be limited by the actions of    the Companys competitors, which may have advantages in    setting their prices because of lower raw material costs.    Competitive pressures in the markets in which the Company    operates may cause channel and product mix to shift away from    more profitable channels and packages. If the Company is unable    to maintain or increase volume in higher-margin products and in    packages sold through higher-margin channels (e.g. immediate    consumption), pricing and gross margins could be adversely    affected. The Companys efforts to improve pricing may    result in lower than expected sales volume. Changes    in how significant customers market or promote the    Companys products could reduce revenue.     The Companys revenue is impacted by how significant    customers market or promote the Companys products. Revenue    has been negatively impacted by less aggressive price promotion    by some retailers in the future consumption channels in the past    several years. If the Companys significant customers    change the manner in which they market or promote the    Companys products, the Companys revenue and    profitability could be adversely impacted. Changes    in public and consumer preferences related to nonalcoholic    beverages could reduce demand for the Companys products    and reduce profitability.     The Companys business depends substantially on consumer    tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways.    The success of the Companys business in large measure    depends on working with the    10Table of Contents    Beverage Companies to meet the changing preferences of the broad    consumer market. Health and wellness trends throughout the    marketplace have resulted in a shift from sugar sparkling    beverages to diet sparkling beverages, tea, sports drinks and    bottled water over the past several years. Failure to satisfy    changing consumer preferences could adversely affect the    profitability of the Companys business. The    Companys sales can be impacted by the health and stability    of the general economy.     Unfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as a    recession or economic slowdown in the geographic markets in    which the Company does business, may have the temporary effect    of reducing the demand for certain of the Companys    products. For example, economic forces may cause consumers to    shift away from purchasing higher-margin products and packages    sold through immediate consumption and other highly profitable    channels, which could adversely affect the Companys price    realization and gross margins. Miscalculation    of the Companys need for infrastructure investment could    impact the Companys financial results.     Projected requirements of the Companys infrastructure    investments may differ from actual levels if the Companys    volume growth is not as the Company anticipates. The    Companys infrastructure investments are generally    long-term in nature; therefore, it is possible that investments    made today may not generate the returns expected by the Company    due to future changes in the marketplace. Significant changes    from the Companys expected returns on cold drink    equipment, fleet, technology and supply chain infrastructure    investments could adversely affect the Companys    consolidated financial results. The    Companys inability to meet requirements under its bottling    contracts could result in the loss of distribution    rights.     Approximately 89% of the Companys bottle/can volume with    retail customers consists of products of The    Coca-Cola    Company, which is the sole supplier of the concentrates or    syrups required to manufacture these products. The remaining 11%    of the Companys bottle/can volume with retail customers    generally consists of products of other beverage companies and    the Companys own products. The Company must satisfy    various requirements under its bottling contracts. Failure to    satisfy these requirements could result in the loss of    distribution rights for the respective products. Material    changes in, or the Companys inability to satisfy, the    performance requirements for marketing funding support, or    decreases from historic levels of marketing funding support,    could reduce the Companys profitability.     Material changes in the performance requirements, or decreases    in the levels of marketing funding support historically    provided, under marketing programs with The    Coca-Cola    Company and other beverage companies, or the Companys    inability to meet the performance requirements for the    anticipated levels of such marketing funding support payments,    could adversely affect the Companys profitability. The    Coca-Cola    Company and other beverage companies are under no obligation to    continue marketing funding support at historic levels. Changes    in The    Coca-Cola    Companys and other beverage companies levels of    advertising, marketing spending and product innovation could    reduce the Companys sales volume.     The    Coca-Cola    Companys and other beverage companies levels of    advertising, marketing spending and product innovation directly    impact the Companys operations. While the Company does not    believe there will be significant changes in the levels of    marketing and advertising by the Beverage Companies, there can    be no assurance that historic levels will continue. In addition,    if the volume of sugar sparkling beverages continues to decline,    the Companys volume growth will continue to be dependent    on product innovation by the Beverage Companies, especially The    Coca-Cola    Company. Decreases in Beverage Company marketing, advertising    and product innovation could adversely impact the profitability    of the Company.    11Table of ContentsThe    inability of the Companys aluminum can or plastic bottle    suppliers to meet the Companys purchase requirements could    reduce the Companys profitability.     The Company currently obtains all of its aluminum cans from one    domestic supplier and all of its plastic bottles from two    domestic cooperatives. The inability of these aluminum can or    plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Companys requirements    for containers could result in short-term shortages until    alternative sources of supply can be located. The Company    attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key    suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance    where appropriate. Failure of the aluminum can or plastic bottle    suppliers to meet the Companys purchase requirements could    reduce the Companys profitability. The    inability of the Company to offset higher raw material costs    with higher selling prices, increased bottle/can volume or    reduced expenses could have an adverse impact on the    Companys profitability.     Packaging costs, primarily aluminum cans, and high fructose corn    syrup cost increased significantly in 2007. The Company expects    concentrate, plastic bottles, aluminum cans and high fructose    corn syrup costs to increase in 2008. In addition, there are no    limits on the prices The    Coca-Cola    Company and other beverage companies can charge for concentrate.    If the Company cannot offset higher raw material costs with    higher selling prices, increased sales volume or reductions in    other costs, the Companys profitability could be adversely    affected.     In recent years, there has been consolidation among suppliers of    certain of the Companys raw materials. The reduction in    the number of competitive sources of supply could have an    adverse effect upon the Companys ability to negotiate the    lowest costs and, in light of the Companys relatively    small in-plant raw material inventory levels, has the potential    for causing interruptions in the Companys supply of raw    materials.     With the introduction of FUZE, Campbell and glacéau    products into the Companys portfolio during 2007, the    Company is becoming increasingly reliant on purchased finished    goods from external sources versus the Companys internal    production. As a result, the Company is subject to incremental    risk including, but not limited to, product availability, price    variability, product quality and production capacity shortfalls    for externally purchased finished goods. Sustained    increases in fuel prices or the inability of the Company to    secure adequate supplies of fuel could have an adverse impact on    the Companys profitability.     The Company has experienced significant increases in fuel prices    as a result primarily of macro-economic factors beyond the    Companys control. The Company uses significant amounts of    fuel in the distribution of its products. Events such as natural    disasters could impact the supply of fuel and could impact the    timely delivery of the Companys products to its customers.    While the Company is working to reduce fuel consumption, there    can be no assurance that the Company will succeed in limiting    future cost increases. Continued upward pressure in these costs    could reduce the profitability of the Companys operations. Sustained    increases in workers compensation, employment practices    and vehicle accident costs could reduce the Companys    profitability.     The Company is generally self-insured for the costs of    workers compensation, employment practices and vehicle    accident claims. Losses are accrued using assumptions and    procedures followed in the insurance industry, adjusted for    company-specific history and expectations. Although the Company    has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there    can be no assurance that the Company will succeed in limiting    future cost increases. Continued upward pressure in these costs    could reduce the profitability of the Companys operations. Sustained    increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce the    Companys profitability.     The Companys profitability is substantially affected by    the cost of pension retirement benefits, postretirement medical    benefits and current employees medical benefits. In recent    years, the Company has experienced significant increases in    these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond the    Companys control, including increases in health care    costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and    changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related    liabilities. Although the Company has actively sought to control    increases in these costs, there    12Table of Contents    can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future    cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs    could reduce the profitability of the Companys operations. Product    liability claims brought against the Company or product recalls    could negatively affect the Companys business, financial    results and brand image.     The Company may be liable if the consumption of the    Companys products causes injury or illness. The Company    may also be required to recall products if they become    contaminated or are damaged or mislabeled. A significant product    liability or other product-related legal judgment against the    Company or a widespread recall of the Companys products    could negatively impact the Companys business, financial    results and brand image. Technology    failures could disrupt the Companys operations and    negatively impact the Companys business.     The Company increasingly relies on information technology    systems to process, transmit and store electronic information.    For example, the Companys production and distribution    facilities, inventory management and driver handheld devices all    utilize information technology to maximize efficiencies and    minimize costs. Furthermore, a significant portion of the    communication between personnel, customers and suppliers depends    on information technology. Like all companies, the    Companys information technology systems may be vulnerable    to a variety of interruptions due to events beyond the    Companys control, including, but not limited to, natural    disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures,    computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. The Company    has technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans    in place to mitigate the Companys risk to these    vulnerabilities, but these measures may not be adequate or    implemented properly to ensure that the Companys    operations are not disrupted. Changes    in interest rates could adversely affect the profitability of    the Company.     Approximately 41% of the Companys debt and capital lease    obligations of $679.1 million as of December 30, 2007    was subject to changes in short-term interest rates. In    addition, the Companys pension and postretirement medical    benefits costs are subject to changes in interest rates. If    interest rates increase in the future, there can be no assurance    that future increases in interest expense will not reduce the    Companys overall profitability. The    Companys credit rating could be negatively impacted by The    Coca-Cola    Company.     The Companys credit rating could be significantly impacted    by capital management activities of The    Coca-Cola    Company    and/or    changes in the credit rating of The    Coca-Cola    Company. A lower credit rating could significantly increase the    Companys interest costs or could have an adverse effect on    the Companys ability to obtain additional financing at    acceptable interest rates or to refinance existing debt. Changes    in legal contingencies could adversely impact the Companys    future profitability.     Changes from expectations for the resolution of outstanding    legal claims and assessments could have a material adverse    impact on the Companys profitability and financial    condition. In addition, the Companys failure to abide by    laws, orders or other legal commitments could subject the    Company to fines, penalties or other damages. Legislative    changes that affect the Companys distribution and    packaging could reduce demand for the Companys products or    increase the Companys costs.     The Companys business model is dependent on the    availability of the Companys various products and packages    in multiple channels and locations versus those of the    Companys competitors to better satisfy the needs of the    Companys customers and consumers. Laws that restrict the    Companys ability to distribute products in schools and    other venues, as well as laws that require deposits for certain    types of packages or those that limit the Companys ability    to design new packages or market certain packages, could    negatively impact the financial results of the Company.    13Table of ContentsAdditional    taxes resulting from tax audits could adversely impact the    Companys future profitability.     An assessment of additional taxes resulting from audits of the    Companys tax filings could have an adverse impact on the    Companys profitability, cash flows and financial condition. Natural    disasters and unfavorable weather could negatively impact the    Companys future profitability.     Natural disasters or unfavorable weather conditions in the    geographic regions in which the Company does business could have    an adverse impact on the Companys revenue and    profitability. For example, prolonged drought conditions in the    geographic regions in which the Company does business could lead    to restrictions on the use of water, which could adversely    affect the Companys ability to manufacture and distribute    products and the Companys cost to do so. Issues    surrounding labor relations could adversely impact the    Companys future profitability and/or its operating    efficiency.     Approximately 7% of the Companys employees are covered by    collective bargaining agreements. The inability to renegotiate    subsequent agreements on satisfactory terms and conditions could    result in work interruptions or stoppages, which could have a    material impact on the profitability of the Company. Also, the    terms and conditions of existing or renegotiated agreements    could increase costs, or otherwise affect the Companys    ability to fully implement operational changes to improve    overall efficiency. Two collective bargaining agreements    covering approximately 5% of the Companys employees expire    in 2008. The    Companys ability to change distribution methods and    business practices could be negatively affected by United States    bottler system disputes.     Recent litigation filed by some United States bottlers of    Coca-Cola    products indicates that disagreements may exist within the    Coca-Cola    bottler system concerning distribution methods and business    practices. Although the litigation has been resolved,    disagreements among various    Coca-Cola    bottlers could adversely affect the Companys ability to    fully implement its business plans in the future. Managements    use of estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on    reported results.     The Companys consolidated financial statements and    accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements    include estimates and assumptions by management that impact    reported amounts.

The impact of restrictive legislation, if    widely enacted, could have an adverse impact on the    Companys products, image and reputation. The    concentration of the Companys capital stock ownership with    the Harrison family limits other stockholders ability to    influence corporate matters.     Members of the Harrison family, including the Companys    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, J. Frank    Harrison, III, beneficially own shares of Common Stock and    Class B Common Stock representing approximately 91.8% of    the total voting power of the Companys outstanding capital    stock. In addition, two members of the Harrison family,    including Mr. Harrison, III, serve on the Board of    Directors of the Company. As a result, members of the Harrison    family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual    control over the Companys management and affairs and over    substantially all matters requiring action by the Companys    stockholders. This    14Table of Contents    concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying    or preventing a change in control otherwise favored by the    Companys other stockholders and could depress the stock    price.     Additionally, as a result of the Harrison familys    significant beneficial ownership of the Companys    outstanding voting stock, the Company has relied on the    controlled company exemption from certain corporate    governance requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. This    concentration of control limits other stockholders ability    to influence corporate matters and, as a result, the Company may    take actions that the Companys stockholders do not view as    beneficial. "
9,COKE,COCA-COLA BTLNG CONS,2007-03-14,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
    In addition to other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Companys business.The Companys business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties, including risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company, orthat the Company currently deems immaterial, may also impair its business and results of operations.    Lower than expected selling prices resulting from increased marketplace competition could adversely affect the Companys profitability.    The nonalcoholic beverage markets are highly competitive. The Companys competitors in these markets include bottlersand distributors of nationally advertised and marketed products, regionally advertised and marketed products and private label beverages. Although the Company has placed an emphasis on revenue management, there can be no assurance that increasedcompetition will not reduce the Companys profitability.    Changes inhow significant customers market or promote the Companys products could reduce revenue.    The Companys revenue is impacted by how significant customers market or promote the Companys products. Revenue has been negatively impacted byless aggressive price promotion by some retailers in the future consumption channels in the past several years. If the Companys significant customers change the manner in which they market or promote the Companys products, theCompanys revenue and profitability could be adversely impacted.    Changes in public and consumer preferences related to nonalcoholic beverages could reduce demand for the Companys products and reduce profitability.     The Companys business depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictableways. The success of the Companys business in large measure depends on working with the Beverage Companies to meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market. Health and wellness trends throughout the marketplace have resulted in ashift from sugar carbonated beverages to diet carbonated beverages, tea, sports drinks and bottled water over the past several years. Failure to satisfy changing consumer preferences could adversely affect the profitability of the Companysbusiness.    The Companys inability to meet requirements under itsbottling contracts could result in the loss of distribution rights.    Approximately 90% of the Companys bottle/can sales volume with retail customers consists of products of The Coca-Cola Company, which is the sole supplier of the concentrates or syrups required to manufacture these   10 Table of Contentsproducts. The remaining 10% of the Companys bottle/can sales volume with retail customers generally consists of products of other beverage companies.The Company has bottling contracts under which it has various requirements to meet. Failure to meet the requirements of these bottling contracts could result in the loss of distribution rights for the respective products.    Material changes in, or the Companys inability to meet, the performance requirementsfor marketing funding support, or decreases from historic levels of marketing funding support, could reduce the Companys profitability.    Material changes in the performance requirements, or decreases in the levels of marketing funding support historically provided, under marketing programswith The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies, or the Companys inability to meet the performance requirements for the anticipated levels of such marketing funding support payments, could adversely affect the Companysprofitability. The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies are under no obligation to continue marketing funding support at historic levels.    Changes in The Coca-Cola Companys and other beverage companies levels of advertising, marketing spending and brand innovation could reduce theCompanys sales volume.    The Coca-Cola Companysand other beverage companies levels of advertising, marketing spending and brand innovation directly impact the Companys operations. While the Company does not believe there will be significant changes in the levels of marketing andadvertising by the Beverage Companies, there can be no assurance that historic levels will continue. In addition, if the sales volume of sugar carbonated beverages continues to decline, the Companys sales volume growth will continue to bedependent on brand innovation by the Beverage Companies, especially The Coca-Cola Company. Decreases in Beverage Company marketing, advertising and product brand innovation could adversely impact the profitability of the Company.    The inability of the Companys aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet theCompanys purchase requirements could reduce the Companys profitability.    The Company currently obtains all of its aluminum cans from one domestic supplier and all of its plastic bottles from two domestic cooperatives. The inability of these aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meetthe Companys requirements for containers could result in short-term shortages until alternative sources of supply can be located. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers and by purchasing businessinterruption insurance where appropriate. Failure of the aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Companys purchase requirements could reduce the Companys profitability.    The inability of the Company to offset higher raw material costs with higher sellingprices, increased bottle/can sales volume or reduced expenses could have an adverse impact on the Companys profitability.    Packaging costs, primarily plastic bottle costs and aluminum can costs, increased in 2006. The Company expects aluminum can and high fructose corn syrupcosts to increase significantly in 2007. In addition, there are no limits on the prices The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies can charge for concentrate. If the Company cannot offset higher raw material costs with higher selling prices,increased sales volume or reductions in other costs, the Companys profitability could be adversely affected.    Sustained increases in fuel costs or the inability of the Company to secure adequate supplies of fuel could have an adverse impact on the Companys profitability.   The Company has experienced significant increases in fuelcosts as a result primarily of macro-economic factors beyond the Companys control. The Company uses significant amounts of fuel in the distribution of its products. Events such as natural disasters could impact the supply of fuel and couldimpact the timely delivery of the Companys products to its customers. While the Company is working to reduce fuel consumption, there can   11 Table of Contentsbe no assurance that the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases. Continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce the profitability ofthe Companys operations.    Sustained increases in workerscompensation, employment practices and vehicle accident costs could reduce the Companys profitability.    The Company is generally self-insured for the costs of workers compensation, employment practices and vehicle accident claims. Losses are accruedusing assumptions and procedures followed in the insurance industry, adjusted for company-specific history and expectations. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that the Companywill succeed in limiting future cost increases. Continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce the profitability of the Companys operations.    Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce the Companys profitability.    The Companys profitability is substantially affected by the cost of pension retirement benefits, postretirementmedical benefits and current employees medical benefits. In recent years, the Company has experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond the Companys control, including increases in healthcare costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance theCompany will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce the profitability of the Companys operations.    Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the profitability of the Company.    Approximately 42% of the Companys debt and capital lease obligations of$769.0 million as of December 31, 2006 was subject to changes in short-term interest rates. Rising interest rates have increased the Companys interest expense over the past two years. In addition, the Companys pension andpostretirement medical benefits costs are subject to changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase in the future, there can be no assurance that future increases in interest expense will not reduce the Companys overall profitability.   The Companys credit rating could be impacted by The Coca-ColaCompany.    The Companys credit rating could besignificantly impacted by capital management activities of The Coca-Cola Company and/or changes in the credit rating of The Coca-Cola Company. A lower credit rating could significantly increase the Companys interest cost.    Changes in legal contingencies could impact the Companys future profitability.   Changes from expectations for the resolution ofoutstanding legal claims and assessments could have a material adverse impact on the Companys profitability and financial condition. In addition, the Companys failure to abide by laws, orders or other legal commitments could subject theCompany to fines, penalties or other damages.    Additional taxes resultingfrom tax audits could impact the Companys future profitability.    An assessment of additional taxes resulting from audits of the Companys tax filings could have a material impact on the Companys profitability, cash flows and financial condition.    Natural disasters and unfavorable weather could impact the Companys futureprofitability.    Natural disasters or unfavorable weatherconditions in the geographic regions in which the Company does business could have a material impact on the Companys revenue and profitability.   12 Table of ContentsIssues surrounding labor relations could impact the Companys future profitability and/or its operatingefficiency.    Approximately 7% of the Companysemployees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The inability to renegotiate subsequent agreements on satisfactory terms and conditions could result in work interruptions or stoppages, which could have a material impact on theprofitability of the Company. Also, the terms and conditions of existing or renegotiated agreements could increase costs, or otherwise affect the Companys ability to fully implement operational changes to improve overall efficiency.   The Companys ability to change distribution methods and businesspractices could be affected by United States bottler system disputes.    Recent litigation filed by some United States bottlers of Coca-Cola products indicates that disagreements may exist within the Coca-Cola bottler system concerning distribution methods and business practices. Althoughthe litigation has been dismissed without prejudice, these disagreements among various Coca-Cola bottlers have not been finally resolved and could adversely affect the Companys ability to fully implement its business plans in the future.   Managements use of estimates and assumptions could have a materialeffect on reported results.    The Companysconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements include estimates and assumptions by management that impact reported amounts. Actual results could differ from those estimates.    The Companys Board of Directors has the ability to declare dividends on theCompanys Common Stock without declaring equal or any dividends of the Companys Class B Common Stock.    Under the Companys Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors may declare dividends on Common Stock without declaring equal or anydividends on the Class B Common Stock. However, the holders of the Class B Common Stock control approximately 88% of the total voting power of the common stockholders of the Company and the election of the Board, and the Board has declared and theCompany has paid dividends on Common Stock and Class B Common Stock and each class of common stock has participated equally, on a per share basis, in all dividends declared and paid by the Board since 1994. As such, the Company does not believe theBoard would systematically declare dividends on the Common Stock without declaring dividends on the Class B Common Stock.    The Company has experienced public policy challenges regarding the sale of soft drinks in schools, particularly elementary, middle and high schools.    At December 31, 2006, a number of states had regulations restricting thesale of soft drinks and other foods in schools. Many of these restrictions have existed for several years in connection with subsidized meal programs in schools. The focus has more recently turned to the growing health, nutrition and obesityconcerns of todays youth. The impact of restrictive legislation, if widely enacted, could have an adverse impact on the Companys products, images and reputation.    The concentration of the Companys capital stock ownership with the Harrison family will limit other stockholders ability toinfluence corporate matters.    Members of the Harrisonfamily, including the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, J. Frank Harrison, III, beneficially own shares of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock representing approximately 92% of the total voting power of the Companysoutstanding capital stock. In addition, two members of the Harrison family, including Mr. Harrison, III serve on the Board of Directors of the Company. As a result,   13 Table of Contentsmembers of the Harrison family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over the Companys management and affairs and oversubstantially all matters requiring action by the Companys stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control otherwise favored by the Companys other stockholders andcould depress the stock price.    Additionally, as a result ofthe Harrison familys significant beneficial ownership of the Companys outstanding voting stock, the Company has relied on the controlled company exemption from certain corporate governance requirements of the Nasdaq StockMarket, LLC. This concentration of control limits other stockholders ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, the Company may take actions that the Companys stockholders do not view as beneficial.   "

The Company considers opportunities for acquiring additional territories on an ongoing basis. To achieve its goals, further purchases and sales of bottling rights and entities possessing such rightsand other related transactions designed to facilitate such purchases and sales may occur. Since 2000, the Company has placed significant emphasis on new product innovation and product line extensions as a strategy to increase overall revenue.   The Coca-Cola Company currently owns 27.3% of theCompanys total outstanding Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on a combined basis. J. Frank Harrison, III, the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is party to a Voting Agreement and Irrevocable Proxy with The Coca-ColaCompany pursuant to which, among other things, Mr. Harrison, III has been granted an Irrevocable Proxy for life concerning the shares of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock owned by The Coca-Cola Company. Mr. Harrison, III currently ownsor controls approximately 92% of the combined voting power of the Companys outstanding Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.    General    In its soft drink operations, the Company holds Bottle Contracts and Allied Bottle Contracts under which it produces and markets, in certain regions,carbonated soft drink products of The Coca-Cola Company, including Coca-Cola classic, caffeine free Coca-Cola classic, Coca-Cola Zero, Coca-Cola with lime, diet Coke, diet Coke with lemon, diet Coke with lime, caffeine free diet Coke, Cherry Coke,diet Cherry Coke, Vanilla Coke, diet Vanilla Coke, Black Cherry Vanilla Coca-Cola, diet Black Cherry Vanilla Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola C2, TAB, Sprite, diet Sprite, Sprite Remix, Vault, Vault Zero, Mello Yello, diet Mello Yello, Mr. PiBB, sugar freeMr. PiBB, Barqs Root Beer, diet Barqs Root Beer, Fresca, Fresca flavors, Fanta flavors, Seagrams products, Minute Maid orange and diet Minute Maid orange.    The Company also distributes and markets under Noncarbonated Beverage Contracts products such as POWERade, Dasani and MinuteMaid Juices To Go in certain of its markets. The Company produces and markets Dr Pepper in some of its regions. The Company also distributes and markets various other products, including Dasani flavors, Minute Maid Adult Refreshments, Full Throttle,Rockstar and Sundrop, in one or more of the Companys regions under agreements with the companies that manufacture the concentrate for those beverages. In addition, the Company also produces soft drinks for other Coca-Cola bottlers.   The Companys principal soft drink is Coca-Cola classic. In each ofthe last three fiscal years, sales of products under the Coca-Cola trademark have accounted for more than half of the Companys bottle/can sales volume to retail customers. In total, the products of The Coca-Cola Company accounted forapproximately 90%, 90% and 91% of the Companys bottle/can sales volume to retail customers during fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.   1 Table of ContentsBeverage Agreements    The Company holds contracts with The Coca-Cola Company which entitle the Company to produce and market The Coca-ColaCompanys soft drinks in bottles, cans and five gallon pressurized pre-mix containers. The Company is one of many companies holding such contracts. The Coca-Cola Company is the sole owner of the secret formulas pursuant to which the primarycomponents (either concentrates or syrups) of Coca-Cola trademark beverages and other trademark beverages are manufactured. The concentrates, when mixed with water and sweetener, produce syrup which, when mixed with carbonated water, produces thesoft drink known as Coca-Cola classic and other soft drinks of The Coca-Cola Company which are manufactured and marketed by the Company. The Company also purchases sweeteners from The Coca-Cola Company. No royalty or other compensationis paid under the contracts with The Coca-Cola Company for the Companys right to use, in its territories, the tradenames and trademarks, such as Coca-Cola classic and their associated patents, copyrights, designs and labels, whichare owned by The Coca-Cola Company. The Coca-Cola Company has no rights under these contracts to establish the resale prices at which the Company sells its products. The Company has similar arrangements with Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc. and otherbeverage companies.    BottleContracts.    The Company is party to standard bottle contracts with The Coca-Cola Company for each of its bottling territories (the Bottle Contracts) which provide that the Company will purchase its entirerequirement of concentrates and syrups for Coca-Cola classic, caffeine free Coca-Cola classic, diet Coke, Coca-Cola Zero, diet Coke with lemon, Coca-Cola with lime, diet Coke with lime, caffeine free diet Coke, Cherry Coke, diet Cherry Coke, VanillaCoke, diet Vanilla Coke, Black Cherry Vanilla Coca-Cola, diet Black Cherry Vanilla Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola C2 (together, the Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages) from The Coca-Cola Company. The Company has the exclusive right to distributeCoca-Cola Trademark Beverages for sale in its territories in authorized containers of the nature currently used by the Company, which include cans and nonrefillable bottles. The Coca-Cola Company may determine from time to time what containers ofthis type to authorize for use by the Company. The Company cannot sell Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages outside of its bottling territories.    The prices The Coca-Cola Company charges for concentrate and syrup under the Bottle Contracts are set by The Coca-Cola Company from time to time. Exceptas provided in the Supplementary Agreement described below, there are no limitations on prices for concentrate or syrup. Consequently, the prices at which the Company purchases concentrate and syrup in the future under the Bottle Contracts may varymaterially from the prices it has paid during the periods covered by the financial information included in this report.    Under the Bottle Contracts, the Company is obligated:     to maintain such plant, equipment, staff and distribution facilities as are required for the manufacture, packaging and distribution of the Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages inauthorized containers, and in sufficient quantities to satisfy fully the demand for these beverages in its territories;     to undertake adequate quality control measures and maintain sanitation standards prescribed by The Coca-Cola Company;     to develop, stimulate and satisfy fully the demand for Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages and to use all approved means, and to spend such funds on advertising and other forms ofmarketing, as may be reasonably required to meet that objective; and     to maintain such sound financial capacity as may be reasonably necessary to assure performance by the Company and its affiliates of their obligations to The Coca-Cola Company.   The Bottle Contracts require the Company tosubmit to The Coca-Cola Company each year its plans for marketing, management and advertising with respect to the Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages for the ensuing year. Such plans must demonstrate that the Company has the financial capacity to performits duties and obligations to The Coca-Cola Company under the Bottle Contracts. The Company must obtain The Coca-Cola   2 Table of ContentsCompanys approval of those plans, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld, and if the Company carries out its plans in all material respects,it will have satisfied its contractual obligations. Failure to carry out such plans in all material respects would constitute an event of default that, if not cured within 120 days of notice of such failure, would give The Coca-Cola Company theright to terminate the Bottle Contracts. If the Company at any time fails to carry out a plan in all material respects with respect to any geographic segment (as defined by The Coca-Cola Company) of its territory, and if that failure is not curedwithin six months of notice of such failure, The Coca-Cola Company may reduce the territory covered by the applicable Bottle Contract by eliminating the portion of the territory with respect to which the failure has occurred.    The Coca-Cola Company has no obligation under the Bottle Contracts toparticipate with the Company in expenditures for advertising and marketing. As it has in the past, The Coca-Cola Company may contribute to such expenditures and undertake independent advertising and marketing activities, as well as advertising andsales promotion programs which require mutual cooperation and financial support of the Company. The future levels of marketing funding support and promotional funds provided by The Coca-Cola Company may vary materially from the levels providedduring the periods covered by the financial information included in this report.    The Coca-Cola Company has the right to reformulate any of the Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages and to discontinue any of the Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages, subject to certain limitations, so long as all Coca-ColaTrademark Beverages are not discontinued. The Coca-Cola Company may also introduce new beverages under the trademarks Coca-Cola or Coke or any modification thereof, and in that event the Company would be obligated tomanufacture, package, distribute and sell the new beverages with the same duties as exist under the Bottle Contracts with respect to Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages.    If the Company acquires the right to manufacture and sell Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages in any additional territory, theCompany has agreed that such new territory will be covered by a standard contract in the same form as the Bottle Contracts and that any existing agreement with respect to the acquired territory automatically shall be amended to conform to the termsof the Bottle Contracts. In addition, if the Company acquires control, directly or indirectly, of any bottler of Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages, or any party controlling a bottler of Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages, the Company must cause the acquiredbottler to amend its franchises for the Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages to conform to the terms of the Bottle Contracts.    The Bottle Contracts are perpetual, subject to termination by The Coca-Cola Company in the event of default by the Company. Events of default by theCompany include:    1)the Companys insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, receivership or similar conditions;    2)the Companys disposition of any interest in the securities of any bottling subsidiary without the consent of The Coca-Cola Company;    3)termination of any agreement regarding the manufacture, packaging, distribution or sale of Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages between The Coca-Cola Company and any person that controlsthe Company;    4)any material breach of any obligation arising under the Bottle Contracts (including, failure to make timely payment for any concentrate or syrup or of any other debt owing to TheCoca-Cola Company, failure to meet sanitary or quality control standards, failure to comply strictly with manufacturing standards and instructions, failure to carry out an approved plan as described above, and failure to cure a violation of theterms regarding imitation products) that remains uncured for 120 days after notice by The Coca-Cola Company;    5)producing, manufacturing, selling or dealing in any product or any concentrate or syrup which might be confused with those of The Coca-Cola Company;   3 Table of Contents 6)selling any product under any trade dress, trademark or tradename or in any container that is an imitation of a trade dress or container in which The Coca-Cola Company claims aproprietary interest; and    7)owning any equity interest in or controlling any entity which performs any of the activities described in (5) or (6) above.    In addition, upon termination of the Bottle Contracts for any reason, TheCoca-Cola Company, at its discretion, may also terminate any other agreements with the Company regarding the manufacture, packaging, distribution, sale or promotion of soft drinks, including the Allied Bottle Contracts described below.   The Company is prohibited from assigning, transferring or pledging itsBottle Contracts or any interest therein, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior consent of The Coca-Cola Company. Moreover, the Company may not enter into any contract or other arrangement to manage or participate in themanagement of any other Coca-Cola bottler without the prior consent of The Coca-Cola Company.    The Coca-Cola Company may automatically amend the Bottle Contracts if 80% of the domestic bottlers who are parties to agreements with The Coca-Cola Company containing substantially the same terms as the BottleContracts, which bottlers purchased for their own account 80% of the syrup and equivalent gallons of concentrate for Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages purchased for the account of all such bottlers, agree that their bottle contracts shall be likewiseamended.    SupplementaryAgreement.    The Company and The Coca-Cola Company are also parties to a Supplementary Agreement (the Supplementary Agreement) that modifies some of the provisions of the Bottle Contracts. The SupplementaryAgreement provides that The Coca-Cola Company will:     exercise good faith and fair dealing in its relationship with the Company under the Bottle Contracts;     offer marketing funding support and exercise its rights under the Bottle Contracts in a manner consistent with its dealings with comparable bottlers;     offer to the Company any written amendment to the Bottle Contracts (except amendments dealing with transfer of ownership) which it offers to any other bottler in the United States;and     subject to certain limited exceptions, sell syrups and concentrates to the Company at prices no greater than those charged to other bottlers which are parties to contractssubstantially similar to the Bottle Contracts.    The Supplementary Agreement permits transfers of the Companys capital stock that would otherwise be limited by the Bottle Contracts.    Allied Bottle Contracts.    The Company is a party to other contracts with The Coca-Cola Company (the Allied BottleContracts) which grant similar exclusive rights to the Company with respect to the distribution of TAB, Sprite, diet Sprite, Sprite Remix, Vault, Vault Zero, Mello Yello, diet Mello Yello, Mr. PiBB, sugar free Mr. PiBB, BarqsRoot Beer, diet Barqs Root Beer, Fresca, Fresca flavors, Fanta flavors, Seagrams products, Minute Maid orange and diet Minute Maid orange (the Allied Beverages) for sale in authorized containers in its territories. Thesecontracts contain provisions that are similar to those of the Bottle Contracts with respect to pricing, authorized containers, planning, quality control, trademark and transfer restrictions and related matters. Each Allied Bottle Contract has a termof ten years and is renewable by the Company for an additional ten years at the end of each ten-year period, but is subject to termination in the event of (1) the Companys insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, receivership or similarcondition; (2) termination of the Companys Bottle Contracts covering the same territory by either party for any reason; and (3) any material breach of any obligation of the Company under the Allied Bottle Contracts that remainsuncured for 120 days after notice by The Coca-Cola Company.     4 Table of ContentsNoncarbonated Beverage Contracts.    The Company purchases and distributescertain noncarbonated beverages such as isotonics, teas, juice drinks and energy drinks in finished form from The Coca-Cola Company, and produces, markets and distributes Dasani water, pursuant to the terms of marketing and distribution agreements(the Noncarbonated Beverage Contracts). The Noncarbonated Beverage Contracts contain provisions that are similar to the Bottle Contracts and Allied Bottle Contracts with respect to authorized containers, planning and related matters, butthe Noncarbonated Beverage Contracts also have certain significant differences. Unlike the Bottle Contracts and Allied Bottle Contracts, which grant the Company exclusivity in the distribution of the respective beverages in the territory, theNoncarbonated Beverage Contracts grant exclusivity but permit The Coca-Cola Company to test market the noncarbonated beverage products in the territory, subject to the Companys right of first refusal, and to sell the noncarbonated beverages tocommissaries for delivery to retail outlets in the Companys territory where noncarbonated beverages are consumed on-premise, including restaurants. The Coca-Cola Company must pay the Company certain fees in the event of such commissary sales.Also, under the Noncarbonated Beverage Contracts, the Company may not sell other beverages in the same product category. The Coca-Cola Company establishes the pricing the Company must pay for the noncarbonated beverages or, in the case of Dasani,the concentrate. Each of the Noncarbonated Beverage Contracts has a term of ten or fifteen years and is renewable by the Company at the end of each term.    Other Bottling Agreements.    The bottling agreements from most other beverage companies are similar to those described abovein that they are renewable at the option of the Company and the beverage companies. The price the beverage companies may charge for syrup or concentrate is set by the beverage companies from time to time. These bottling agreements also containsimilar restrictions on the use of trademarks, approved bottles, cans and labels and sale of imitations or substitutes as well as termination for cause provisions. Sales of beverages by the Company under these agreements represented approximately10%, 10% and 9% of the Companys bottle/can sales volume to retail customers for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The territories covered by the Allied Bottle Contracts and by bottling agreements for products of beverage companies other thanThe Coca-Cola Company in most cases correspond with the territories covered by the Bottle Contracts. The variations do not have a material effect on the Companys business.    Post-Mix Rights and Sales to Other Bottlers.    The Company also has the non-exclusive right tosell Coca-Cola classic and other fountain syrups (post-mix) of The Coca-Cola Company. In addition, the Company produces some products for sale to other Coca-Cola bottlers. Sales to other bottlers have lower gross margin but allow theCompany to achieve higher utilization of its production facilities.    The Companys net sales by category as a percentage of total net sales is as follows:      Fiscal Year    2005  2004  2003  Bottle/can sales volume under beverage contracts  85% 88% 89% Post-mix  5% 6% 5% Sales to other Coca-Cola bottlers  10% 6% 6%      Total  100% 100% 100%        The increase in salesto other Coca-Cola bottlers in 2005 resulted primarily from volume related to shipments of Full Throttle, the new energy product of The Coca-Cola Company. The Company produces Full Throttle for the majority of the Coca-Cola bottlers in the easternhalf of the United States and anticipates continuing to produce this product for these Coca-Cola bottlers in 2006.    Markets and Production and Distribution Facilities    The Company currently holds bottling rights from The Coca-Cola Company covering the majority of North Carolina, South Carolina and West Virginia, andportions of Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky,   5 Table of ContentsVirginia, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Florida.

All eight members of SAC are Coca-Cola bottlers and each member has equal voting rights. On June 1, 1994, the Company executed a management agreement withSAC. The Company receives a fee for managing the day-to-day operations of SAC pursuant to the management agreement. On June 1, 2004, the Company executed a new management agreement with SAC that extends through May 2014. The terms of the newmanagement agreement are comparable to the prior agreement. Management fees earned from SAC were $1.5 million, $1.6 million and $1.3 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. SACs bottling lines supply a portion of the Companysvolume requirements for finished products. The Company has a commitment with SAC that requires minimum annual purchases of 17.5 million cases of finished product through May 2014. Purchases from SAC by the Company for finished products were $127million, $108 million and $105 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.   6 Table of ContentsRaw Materials    In addition to concentrates obtained by the Company from The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies for use in itssoft drink manufacturing, the Company also purchases sweeteners, carbon dioxide, plastic bottles, cans, closures, other containers and other packaging materials as well as equipment for the production, distribution and marketing of soft drinks.Except for sweeteners, cans, carbon dioxide and plastic bottles, the Company purchases its raw materials from multiple suppliers.    The Company purchases substantially all of its plastic bottles (20-ounce, half liter, 390 ml and 2 liter sizes) from manufacturing plants which are ownedand operated by two cooperatives of Coca-Cola bottlers, including the Company. The Company currently obtains all of its aluminum cans from one domestic supplier.    None of the materials or supplies used by the Company are currently in short supply, although the supply of specificmaterials (including plastic bottles, which are formulated using petroleum-based products) could be adversely affected by strikes, weather conditions, governmental controls or national emergency conditions.    Along with all the other Coca-Cola bottlers in the United States, the Companyhas become a member in Coca-Cola Bottlers Sales and Services Company, LLC (CCBSS), which was formed in 2003 for the purposes of facilitating various procurement functions and distributing certain specified beverage products of TheCoca-Cola Company with the intention of enhancing the efficiency and competitiveness of the Coca-Cola bottling system in the United States. CCBSS negotiated the procurement for the majority of the Companys raw materials (excluding concentrate)in 2005 and 2004.    Customers and Marketing   The Companys products are sold and distributed directly to retailstores and other outlets, including food markets, institutional accounts and vending machine outlets. During 2005, approximately 67% of the Companys bottle/can sales volume to retail customers was sold for future consumption. The remainingsales volume of approximately 33% was sold for immediate consumption, primarily through dispensing machines owned either by the Company, retail outlets or third party vending companies. The Companys largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.,accounted for approximately 15% of the Companys total bottle/can sales volume to retail customers and the second largest customer, Food Lion, LLC, accounted for approximately 10% of the Companys total bottle/can sales volume to retailcustomers. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. accounted for approximately 11% of the Companys total net sales. All of the Companys sales are to customers in the United States.    New product introductions, packaging changes and sales promotions have been the major competitive techniques in thenonalcoholic beverage industry in recent years and have required and are expected to continue to require substantial expenditures. Brand introductions in the last three years include Coca-Cola Zero, Coca-Cola C2, diet Coke with lime, diet Coke withlemon, Vault, Vault Zero, Rockstar, Dasani flavors, Minute Maid Light, Sprite Remix and Full Throttle, an energy product from The Coca-Cola Company. New packaging introductions include Fridge Pack 12-ounce plastic bottles and 390 ml plasticbottles. New product and packaging introductions have resulted in increased operating costs for the Company due to special marketing efforts, obsolescence of replaced items and, in some cases, higher raw materials costs.    The Company sells its products primarily in nonrefillable bottles and cans,in varying proportions from market to market. There may be as many as 25 different packages for Coca-Cola classic within a single geographic area. Bottle/can sales volume to retail customers during 2005 was approximately 46% cans, 52% nonrefillablebottles and 2% other containers.    Advertising in various media,primarily television and radio, is relied upon extensively in the marketing of the Companys products. The Coca-Cola Company and Dr Pepper/Seven-Up, Inc. (the Beverage Companies) make substantial expenditures on advertising in theCompanys territories. The Company has also benefited from   7 Table of Contentsnational advertising programs conducted by the Beverage Companies. In addition, the Company expends substantial funds on its own behalf for extensive localsales promotions of the Companys products. Historically, these expenses have been partially offset by marketing funding support which the Beverage Companies provide to the Company in support of a variety of marketing programs, such aspoint-of-sale displays and merchandising programs. However, the Beverage Companies are under no obligation to provide the Company with marketing funding support in the future.    The substantial outlays which the Company makes for marketing and merchandising programs are generally regarded as necessaryto maintain or increase sales volume, and any significant curtailment of marketing funding support provided by the Beverage Companies for marketing programs which benefit the Company could have a material adverse effect on the operating andfinancial results of the Company.    Seasonality   Sales are seasonal, with the highest sales volumeoccurring in May, June, July and August. The Company has adequate production capacity to meet sales demand during these peak periods. Sales volume can be impacted by weather conditions. See Item 2. Properties for information relating toutilization of the Companys production facilities.    Competition    The carbonated soft drink marketand the noncarbonated beverage market are highly competitive. Our competitors in these markets include bottlers and distributors of nationally advertised and marketed products, regionally advertised and marketed products, as well as bottlers anddistributors of private label soft drinks in supermarket stores. The carbonated soft drink market comprised 87% of the Companys bottle/can sales volume to retail customers in 2005. In each region in which the Company operates, between 75% and95% of carbonated soft drink sales in bottles, cans and pre-mix containers are accounted for by the Company and its principal competition, which in each region includes the local bottler of Pepsi-Cola and, in some regions, also includes the localbottler of Dr Pepper, Royal Crown and/or 7-Up products.    Theprincipal methods of competition in the soft drink industry are point-of-sale merchandising, new product introductions, new vending and dispensing equipment, packaging changes, pricing, price promotions, product quality, retail space management,customer service, frequency of distribution and advertising. The Company believes that it is competitive in its territories with respect to these methods of competition.    Government Regulation    The production and marketing of beverages are subject to the rules and regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) andother federal, state and local health agencies. The FDA also regulates the labeling of containers.    As a manufacturer, distributor and seller of beverage products of The Coca-Cola Company and other soft drink manufacturers in exclusive territories, theCompany is subject to antitrust laws of general applicability. However, pursuant to the United States Soft Drink Interbrand Competition Act, soft drink bottlers such as the Company may have an exclusive right to manufacture, distribute and sell asoft drink product in a defined geographic territory if that soft drink product is in substantial and effective competition with other products of the same general class in the market. The Company believes that there is such substantial andeffective competition in each of the exclusive geographic territories in the United States in which the Company operates.    From time to time, legislation has been proposed in Congress and by certain state and local governments which would prohibit the sale of soft drinkproducts in nonrefillable bottles and cans or require a mandatory deposit as a means of encouraging the return of such containers in an attempt to reduce solid waste and litter. The Company is currently not impacted by this type of proposedlegislation.   8 Table of ContentsSoft drink and similar-type taxes have been in place in West Virginia and Tennessee for several years.   The Companys tax filings are subject to audit by taxauthorities in jurisdictions where it conducts business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are subsequently resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts. Management believes the Company has adequatelyaccrued for any ultimate amounts that are likely to result from these audits; however, final assessments, if any, could be different than the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements.    The Company has experienced public policy challenges regarding the sale ofsoft drinks in schools, particularly elementary, middle and high schools. At January 1, 2006, a number of states had regulations restricting the sale of soft drinks and other foods in schools. Many of these restrictions have existed for severalyears in connection with subsidized meal programs in schools. The focus has more recently turned to the growing health, nutrition and obesity concerns of todays youth. The impact of restrictive legislation, if widely enacted, could have anadverse impact on the Companys products, image and reputation.    Environmental Remediation    The Company doesnot currently have any material capital expenditure commitments for environmental compliance or environmental remediation for any of its properties. The Company does not believe that compliance with federal, state and local provisions that have beenenacted or adopted regarding the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.    Employees    As of February 1, 2006, the Company had approximately 5,700 full-timeemployees, of whom approximately 400 were union members. The total number of employees, including part-time employees, was approximately 6,200.    Approximately 7% of the Companys labor force is currently covered by collective bargaining agreements. One collective bargaining agreement coveringless than .5% of the Companys employees expires in 2006.    Exchange Act Reports and Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers    The Company makes available free of charge through its Internet website, www.cokeconsolidated.com, its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments tothose reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

    Inaddition to other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Companys business. The Companys business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially andadversely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties, including   9 Table of Contentsrisks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company, or that the Company currently deems immaterial, may also impair its business and results ofoperations.    Lower than expected selling prices resulting from increasedmarketplace competition could adversely affect the Companys profitability.    The carbonated soft drink market and the noncarbonated beverage market are highly competitive. The Companys competitors in these markets include bottlers and distributors of nationally advertised and marketedproducts, regionally advertised and marketed products and private label soft drinks. Although the Company has placed an emphasis on revenue management, which includes striking the appropriate balance between generating growth in volume, gross marginand market share, there can be no assurance that increased competition will not reduce the Companys profitability.    Changes in how significant customers market or promote the Companys products could reduce sales volume.    The Companys sales volume is impacted by how significant customersmarket or promote the Companys products. Sales volume has been negatively impacted by less aggressive price promotion by some retailers in the future consumption channels in the past several years. If the Companys significant customerschange the way they market or promote the Companys products, the Companys sales volume, revenue and profitability could be adversely impacted.    Changes in public and consumer preferences related to nonalcoholic beverages could reduce demand for the Companys products and reduce profitability.    The Companys business depends substantially onconsumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of the Companys business depends on working with the beverage companies to meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market. The Company has seen ashift from sugar carbonated beverages to diet carbonated beverages, isotonics, bottled water and energy products over the past several years. Failure to satisfy changing consumer preferences could adversely affect the profitability of theCompanys business.    The Companys inability to meet requirementsunder its bottling contracts could result in the loss of distribution rights.    Approximately 90% of the Companys bottle/can sales volume with retail customers consists of products of The Coca-Cola Company, which is the sole supplier of the concentrates or syrups required to manufacturethese products. The remaining 10% of the Companys bottle/can sales volume with retail customers consists of products of other beverage companies. The Company has bottling contracts under which it has various requirements to meet. Failure tomeet the requirements of these bottling contracts could result in the loss of distribution rights for the respective product.    Material changes in, or the Companys inability to meet, the performance requirements for marketing funding support, or decreases from historic levels ofmarketing funding support, would reduce the Companys profitability.    Material changes in the performance requirements, or decreases in the levels of marketing funding support historically provided, under marketing programs with The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies, or theCompanys inability to meet the performance requirements for the anticipated levels of such marketing funding support payments, would adversely affect the Companys profitability. The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies areunder no obligation to continue marketing funding support at historic levels.   10 Table of ContentsChanges in The Coca-Cola Companys and other beverage companies levels of advertising, marketing spendingand brand innovation could reduce the Companys sales volume.    The Coca-Cola Companys and other beverage companies levels of advertising, marketing spending and brand innovation directly impact the Companys operations. While the Company does not believe that there will be significantchanges in the levels of marketing and advertising by the beverage companies, there can be no assurance that historic levels will continue. In addition, if the sales volume of sugar carbonated beverages continues to decline, the Companys salesvolume growth will continue to be dependent on brand innovation by the beverage companies, especially The Coca-Cola Company. Decreases in beverage company marketing, advertising and product brand innovation could adversely impact the profitabilityof the Company.    The inability of the Companys aluminum can or plasticbottle suppliers to meet the Companys purchase requirements may reduce the Companys profitability.    The Company currently obtains all of its aluminum cans from one domestic supplier and all of its plastic bottles from two domestic cooperatives. Theinability of these aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Companys requirements for containers could result in short-term shortages until alternative sources of supply can be located. The Company attempts to mitigate these risksby working closely with key suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate. Failure of the aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Companys purchase requirements could reduce the Companysprofitability.    The inability of the Company to offset higher raw materialcosts with higher selling prices, increased bottle/can sales volume or reduced expenses could have an adverse impact on the Companys profitability.    Packaging costs, primarily plastic bottle costs and aluminum can costs increased significantly in 2005 and could continue to increase in the future. Ifthe Company cannot offset higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, increased sales volume or reductions in other costs, the Companys profitability could be adversely affected.    Sustained increases in fuel costs or the inability of the Company to secure adequatesupplies of fuel could have an adverse impact on the Companys profitability.    The Company has experienced significant increases in fuel costs as a result primarily of macro-economic factors beyond the Companys control. In addition, the Company uses significant amounts of fuel in thedistribution of its products. Events such as natural disasters could impact the supply of fuel and could impact the timely delivery of the Companys products to its customers. While the Company is working to reduce fuel consumption, there canbe no assurance that the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases. Continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce the profitability of the Companys operations.    Sustained increases in workers compensation, employment practices and vehicle accident costs may reduce the Companysprofitability.    The Company is generally self-insured forthe costs of workers compensation, employment practices and vehicle accident claims. Losses are accrued using assumptions and procedures followed in the insurance industry, adjusted for company-specific history and expectations. Although theCompany has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases. Continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce the profitability of the Companysoperations.    Sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits may reducethe Companys profitability.    With approximately 6,000employees, the Companys profitability is substantially affected by the cost of pension retirement benefits, post-retirement medical benefits and current employees medical benefits. In recent   11 Table of Contentsyears, the Company has experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond the Companys control, includingincreases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there canbe no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce the profitability of the Companys operations.    Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the profitability of the Company.    Approximately 43% of the Companys debt and capital lease obligations of$777.2 million as of January 1, 2006 was subject to changes in short-term interest rates. Rising interest rates have increased the Companys interest expense over the past two years. If interest rates increased by 1%, the Companysinterest expense would increase by approximately $3 million over the next twelve months. This amount is determined by calculating the effect of a hypothetical interest rate increase of 1% on outstanding floating rate debt and capital leaseobligations as of January 1, 2006, including the effects of the Companys derivative financial instruments. This calculated, hypothetical increase in interest expense for the following twelve months may be different from the actualincrease in interest expense from a 1% increase in interest rates due to varying interest rate reset dates on the Companys floating rate debt and derivative financial instruments. In addition, the Companys pension and postretirementmedical benefits costs are subject to changes in interest rates. There can be no assurance that future increases in interest rates will not reduce the Companys profitability.    The Companys debt rating could be impacted by The Coca-Cola Company.    The Companys debt rating could be significantly impacted by capitalmanagement activities of The Coca-Cola Company and/or changes in the debt rating of The Coca-Cola Company. A lower debt rating could significantly increase the Companys interest cost.    Changes in legal contingencies could impact the Companys future profitability.   Changes from expectations for the resolution ofoutstanding legal claims and assessments could have a material adverse impact on the Companys profitability and financial condition. In addition, the Companys failure to abide by laws, orders or other legal commitments could subject theCompany to fines, penalties or other damages.    Additional taxes resultingfrom tax audits could impact the Companys future profitability.    An assessment of additional taxes resulting from audits of the Companys tax filings could have a material impact on the Companys profitability, cash flows and financial condition.    Natural disasters and unfavorable weather could impact the Companys futureprofitability.    Natural disasters or unfavorable weatherconditions in the geographic regions in which the Company does business could have a material impact on the Companys revenue and profitability.    Issues surrounding labor relations could impact the Companys future profitability and/or its operating efficiency.    Approximately 7% of the Companys employees are covered by collectivebargaining agreements. The inability to renegotiate subsequent agreements on satisfactory terms and conditions could result in work interruptions or stoppages, which could have a material impact on the profitability of the Company. Also, the termsand conditions of existing or renegotiated agreements could increase costs, or otherwise affect the Companys ability to fully implement operational changes to improve overall efficiency.   12 Table of ContentsRecent bottler litigation could limit the Companys ability to change distribution methods and businesspractices.    Litigation recently filed by some United Statesbottlers of Coca-Cola products reflects disagreements in the Coca-Cola bottler system concerning distribution methods and business practices. These disagreements among various Coca-Cola bottlers could adversely affect the Companys ability tofully implement its business plans.    Managements use of estimates andassumptions may have a material effect on reported results.    The Companys consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements include estimates and assumptions by management that impact reported amounts. Actual results could differ from thoseestimates.   "
