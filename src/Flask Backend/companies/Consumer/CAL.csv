outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-19”) both in the U.S. and globally, and related government and private sector responsive actions, has adversely affected and continues to impact our business operations.  It is impossible to predict the effect and ultimate impact of COVID-19 and the impact on the economy, the retail industry and the Company.  The spread of COVID-19 has caused public health officials to recommend precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, which has impacted retail store traffic and consumer sentiment.  Effective March 19, 2020, we announced the temporary closure of all retail stores throughout the United States and Canada.  While the store closures are expected to be temporary, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration of the store closures, the impact on consumer demand and the impact to our wholesale customers that may also have been impacted by store closures, nor the impact to our 2020 financial results or cash flows.  The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact.  A prolonged health crisis may have a material impact on the retail sector, consumer demand, and the Company's results of operations and liquidity.  Consumer demand for our products may be adversely impacted by economic conditions and other factors.Worldwide economic conditions continue to be uncertain.  Consumer confidence and spending are strongly influenced by general economic conditions and other factors, including COVID-19, fiscal policy, the changing tax and regulatory environment, interest rates, minimum wage rates and regulations, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, the liquidity of consumers’ assets, health care costs, currency exchange rates, taxation, energy costs, real estate values, foreclosure rates, unemployment trends, weather conditions and the economic consequences of military action or terrorist activities.  Negative economic conditions generally decrease disposable income and, consequently, consumer purchases of discretionary items like our products.  Negative trends in economic conditions could also drive up the cost of our products, which may require us to increase our product prices.  These increases in our product costs, and possibly prices, may not be offset by comparable increases in consumer disposable income.  As a result, our customers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or purchase the lower priced products of our competitors, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.  The COVID-19 outbreak and resulting global economic decline is expected to have an adverse impact on consumer demand for our products during 2020 and the long-term impact cannot be reasonably predicted. A long-term decline in our stock price may result in impairment charges.As a result of COVID-19 and the resulting impact to the economy, global stock prices have dropped considerably, including the Company's stock price.  If there is an extended period of lower stock market valuations or an extended closure timeframe for our retail stores and for those of our wholesale customers, the Company may be required to perform additional impairment tests for its goodwill and intangible assets and long-lived assets, which may result in material impairment charges during 2020. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends and successfully apply new technology, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net sales and earnings.The footwear industry is subject to rapidly changing consumer shopping preferences and patterns and fashion trends.  Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change.  In addition, the continuing consumer shift to online and mobile shopping is requiring retailers to lower shipping costs, improve shipping speeds and optimize mobile platforms.  The trend toward online and mobile shopping increases the volume of smaller shipments, including single-pair shipments, from our warehouses.  The increased volume of smaller shipments may result in higher average distribution costs, including both shipping and processing costs incurred at our distribution centers.  The success of both our wholesale and retail operations depends largely on our ability to anticipate, understand and react to these changing consumer shopping patterns.  If we fail to respond to changes in consumer shopping patterns, demands and fashion trends, develop new products and designs, and implement effective, responsive merchandising and distribution strategies and programs, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories and lower gross margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We operate in a highly competitive industry.Competition is intense in the footwear industry.  There has also been consolidation of competitors in the industry, resulting in certain competitors that are larger and have greater financial, marketing and technological resources than we do.  In addition, a move toward vertical integration by our competitors could create additional competitive pressures that may decrease our market share.  Other competitors are able to offer footwear on a lateral basis alongside their apparel products, or have successfully branded their trademarks as lifestyle brands, resulting in greater competitive advantages.  Low barriers to entry into this industry further intensify competition by allowing new companies to easily enter the markets in which we compete.  Some of our suppliers further compound these competitive pressures by allowing consumers to purchase their products directly through supplier-maintained Internet sites and retail stores.  The Internet facilitates price transparency and comparison shopping, which increases the level of competition we face and puts competitive pressure on us to keep our prices low. We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the footwear industry depends on a number of factors, including style, price, performance, quality, location and service, as well as the strength of our brand names.  We remain competitive by increasing awareness of our brands, improving the efficiency of our supply chain and enhancing the style, comfort, fashion and perceived value of our products.  However, our competitors may implement more effective marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, make more attractive offers to potential employees, distribution partners and manufacturers, or respond more quickly to changes in consumer preferences than us.  As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand the development and marketing of our products, which could adversely impact our financial results. We rely primarily on foreign sources of production, which subjects our business to risks associated with international trade.We rely primarily on foreign sourcing for our footwear products through third-party manufacturing facilities located outside the United States.  As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our third-party foreign manufacturers.  Foreign sourcing is subject to numerous risks, including trade relations, work stoppages, transportation delays (including delays at foreign and domestic ports) and costs (including customs duties, quotas, tariffs, anti-dumping duties, safeguard measures, cargo restrictions or other trade restrictions), domestic and foreign political instability, foreign currency fluctuations, variable economic conditions, expropriation, nationalization, natural disasters, terrorist acts and military conflict, changes in governmental regulations (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) and geo-political events (including the potential impact of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, or ""Brexit"" that occurred on January 31, 2020).  In addition, China and other countries are experiencing a public health emergency due to COVID-19.  While we have experienced some disruption to our supply chain, we cannot accurately predict the full impact that the coronavirus epidemic will have on the ability of manufacturers either in China or in other countries to produce our products.  However, the majority of our factory partners are now operational.  There is also uncertainty surrounding U.S. presidential and congressional elections in 2020 and the impact of any changes to trade legislation.  At the same time, potential changes in manufacturing preferences, including, but not limited to the following, pose additional risk and uncertainty:   •  Manufacturing capacity may shift from footwear to other industries with manufacturing margins that are perceived to be higher.   •  Some footwear manufacturers may face labor shortages as workers seek better wages and working conditions in other industries and locations.         9     Table of Contents As a result of these risks, there can be no assurance that we will not experience reductions in available production capacity, increases in our product costs, late deliveries or terminations of our supplier relationships.  Furthermore, these sourcing risks are compounded by the lack of diversification in the geographic location of our foreign sourcing and manufacturing.  With the majority of our supply originating in China, a substantial portion of our supply could be at risk in the event of any significant negative development related to relations between United States and China. Although we believe we could find alternative manufacturing sources for the products that we currently source from third-party manufacturing facilities in China or other countries, we may not be able to locate alternative manufacturers on terms as favorable as our current terms, including pricing, payment terms, manufacturing capacity, quality standards and lead times for delivery.  In addition, there is substantial competition in the footwear industry for quality footwear manufacturers.  Accordingly, our future results will partly depend on our ability to maintain positive working relationships with, and offer competitive terms to, our foreign manufacturers.  If supply issues cause us to be unable to provide products consistent with our standards or manufacture our footwear in an efficient and cost-effective manner, our customers may cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reductions in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.         The imposition of tariffs on our products may result in higher costs and decreased gross profits.     Recent international events have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade wars and tariffs, which may affect trade between the United States and other countries, particularly with China.  We rely primarily on foreign sourcing for our footwear through third-party manufacturing facilities located outside the United States, with the majority of our footwear sourced from manufacturing facilities in China that     is subject to a 15% tariff that became effective as of September 1, 2019.  Certain types of footwear were subject to a tariff that was to go into effect on December 15, 2019 but was later reversed.  While we continue to focus on mitigating the impact of the enacted tariffs, if we are unable to mitigate the impact or if there is a prolonged trade war involving the further escalation of tariffs, our product costs may increase on a significant portion of our branded footwear that we source internationally. Higher product costs may in turn result in lower gross margins in the future for products that we source from China.            Our operating results depend on preparing accurate sales forecasts and properly managing our inventory levels.Using sales forecasts, we place orders with manufacturers for some of our products prior to the time we receive all of our customers’ orders to minimize purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non-delivery.  We also maintain an inventory of certain products that we anticipate will be in greater demand.  At the retail level, we place orders for products many months in advance of our key selling seasons.  Adverse economic conditions and rapidly changing consumer preferences can make it difficult for us and our retail customers to accurately forecast product trends in order to match production with demand.  If we fail to accurately assess consumer fashion tastes and the impact of economic factors on consumer spending or to effectively differentiate our retail and wholesale offerings, our inventory levels may exceed customer demand, resulting in inventory write-downs, higher carrying costs, lower gross margins or the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could significantly impact our financial results.  Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply the quality products that we require in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages.  Inventory shortages may delay shipments to customers (and possibly require us to offer discounts or costly expedited shipping), negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships, adversely impact our sales results and diminish brand awareness and loyalty.  The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in lower sales, and lower sales projections, particularly in the first half of 2020.  The full impact of the pandemic and its impact on consumer sentiment is difficult to estimate.  In addition, the impact of the pandemic on our third-party independent manufacturers in China or other countries did cause temporary disruptions in our supply chain; however, the majority of our factory partners are now operational. We are reliant upon our information technology systems, and any major disruption of these systems could adversely impact our ability to effectively operate our business.Our computer network and systems are essential to all aspects of our operations, including design, pricing, production, accounting, reporting, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution.  Our ability to manage and maintain our inventory and to deliver products in a timely manner depends on these systems.  If any of these systems fails to operate as expected, we experience problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, a breach in security occurs or a natural disaster interrupts system functions, we may experience delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency in our operations or be required to expend significant capital to correct the problem, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. A cybersecurity breach may adversely affect our sales and reputation.We routinely possess sensitive consumer and associate information and periodically provide it to third parties for analysis, benefit distribution or compliance purposes.  While we believe we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect that information, hackers and data thieves operate sophisticated, large-scale attacks that could breach our information systems, despite ongoing security measures. In addition, we are required to comply with increasingly complex regulations designed to protect our business and personal data.  Any breach of our network security, a third-party’s network security or failure to comply with applicable regulations may result in (a) the loss of valuable business data and/or our consumers’ or associates’ personal information, (b) increased costs associated with implementing additional protections and processes, (c) a disruption of our business and a loss of sales, (d) negative media attention, (e) damage to our consumer and associate relationships and reputation, and (f) fines or lawsuits. Customer concentration and other trends in customer behavior may lead to a reduction in or loss of sales.Our wholesale customers include national chains, online retailers, department stores, mass merchandisers, independent retailers and catalogs.  Several of our customers operate multiple department store divisions.  Furthermore, we often sell multiple types of branded, licensed and private-label footwear to these same customers.  While we believe purchasing decisions in many cases are made independently by the buyers and merchandisers of each of the customers, a decision by a significant customer to decrease the amount of footwear products purchased from us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, including store count reductions at major retail chains, and consumers' continued shift to online shopping, we and our wholesale customers increasingly depend upon a reduced number of key retailers whose bargaining strength is growing.  This consolidation may result in the following adverse consequences:   •  Our wholesale customers may seek more favorable terms for their purchases of our products, which could limit our ability to raise prices, recoup cost increases or achieve our profit goals.   •  The number of stores that carry our products could decline, thereby exposing us to a greater concentration of accounts receivable risk and negatively impacting our brand visibility.           10     Table of Contents We also face the following risks with respect to our customers:     •  Our customers could develop in-house brands or use a higher mix of private-label footwear products, which would negatively impact our sales.   •  As we sell our products to customers and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer’s financial condition, the financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to stop doing business with that customer, reduce our business with that customer or be unable to collect from that customer.   •  Since we transact primarily in United States dollars, our international customers could purchase from competitors who will transact business in their local currency.   •  Certain of our major wholesale customers have experienced a significant downturn or disruption in their business, including the impact of COVID-19. Many of our wholesale customers are having temporary store closures and have sought to cancel orders.  If our customers continue to experience significant downturns or disruptions in their business, we expect these customers will reduce their purchases of our products.   •  Retailers are directly sourcing more of their products directly from foreign manufacturers and reducing their reliance on wholesalers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Transitional challenges with acquisitions could result in unexpected expenditures of time and resources.Periodically, we pursue acquisitions of other companies or businesses, such as our 2018 acquisitions of Blowfish Malibu and Vionic, as further discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.  Although we review the records of acquisition candidates, the review may not reveal all existing or potential problems.  As a result, we may not accurately assess the value of the business and may, accordingly, ultimately assume unknown adverse operating conditions and/or unanticipated expenses and liabilities related to the acquisition.  Acquisitions may also cause us to incur debt, write-offs of goodwill or intangible assets if the business does not perform as well as expected and substantial amortization expenses associated with other intangible assets.  We face the risk that the returns on acquisitions will not support the expenditures or indebtedness incurred to acquire or launch such businesses.  We also face the risk that we will not be able to integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense, delay or other operational or financial problems. Integration may be hindered by, among other things, differing procedures, including internal controls, business practices and technology systems.  We may need to allocate more management resources to integration than we planned, which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other profitable activities. A disruption in the effective functioning of our distribution centers could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis.We currently use several distribution centers, which are leased or third-party managed.  These distribution centers serve as the source of replenishment of inventory for our footwear stores and e-commerce websites operated by our Famous Footwear and Brand Portfolio segments and serve the wholesale operations of our Brand Portfolio segment.  Our success depends on our ability to handle the rapid consumer shift to online shopping and single pair shipments, which requires significant capital to operate with a greater level of sophistication and automation, as well as higher processing and distribution costs.  We may be unable to successfully manage, negotiate or renew our third-party distribution center agreements, or we may experience complications with respect to our distribution centers, such as substantial damage to, or destruction of, such facilities due to natural disasters or ineffective information technology systems.  In such an event, our other distribution centers may not be able to support the resulting additional distribution demands and we may be unable to locate alternative persons or entities capable of fulfilling our distribution needs, resulting in an adverse effect on our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis.  The COVID-19 outbreak may also adversely impact the effective operation of our distribution centers as a result of temporary retail store closures, labor shortages as a result of government mandates to stop the spread of the virus, or disruptions to the supply chain. Some of our distribution centers are located in California, which is a state that has been more severely impacted by COVID-19.    Foreign currency fluctuations may result in higher costs and decreased gross profits.Although we purchase most of our products from foreign manufacturers in United States dollars and otherwise engage in foreign currency hedging transactions, we cannot ensure that we will not experience cost variations with respect to exchange rate changes.  Currency exchange rate fluctuations may also adversely impact third parties who manufacture the Company’s products by making their purchases of raw materials or other production costs more expensive and more difficult to finance, resulting in higher prices and lower margins for the Company, its distributors and licensees. Changes in tax laws may result in increased volatility in our effective tax rates.Our financial results are significantly impacted by the effective tax rates of both our domestic and international operations.  Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by certain provisions of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Act""), which was enacted in December 2017, that directly affect foreign earnings, such as the global intangible low-taxed income tax (""GILTI"") and base-erosion and anti-abuse tax provisions (""BEAT"").  Other factors, such as changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in permitted deductions, changes in tax laws, interpretations, policies and treaties and the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions, may result in higher taxes, lower profitability and increased volatility in our financial results. Our success depends on our ability to retain senior management and recruit and retain other key associates.Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified management, administrative, product development and sales personnel to support existing operations and future growth. In addition, our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses often depends on our ability to retain incumbent personnel, many of whom possess valuable institutional knowledge and operating experience.  Competition for qualified personnel in the footwear industry is intense and we compete for these individuals with other companies that in many cases have superior financial and other resources.  The loss of the services of any member of our senior management or key associates, the inability to attract and retain other qualified personnel or the inability to effectively transition positions could adversely affect the sales, design and production of our products as well as the implementation of our strategic initiatives.         11     Table of Contents Our business, sales and brand value could be harmed by violations of labor, trade or other laws.We focus on doing business with those suppliers who share our commitment to responsible business practices and the principles set forth in our Production Code of Conduct (the “PCOC”).  By requiring our suppliers to comply with the PCOC, we encourage our suppliers to promote best practices and work toward continual improvement throughout their production operations.  The PCOC sets forth standards for working conditions and other matters, including compliance with applicable labor practices, workplace environment and compliance with laws.  Although we promote ethical business practices, we do not control our suppliers or their labor practices.  A failure by any of our suppliers to adhere to these standards or laws could cause us to incur additional costs for our products or cause negative publicity and harm our business and reputation.  We also require our suppliers to meet our standards for product safety, including compliance with applicable laws and standards with respect to safety issues, including lead content in paint. Failure by any of our suppliers to adhere to product safety standards could lead to a product recall, which may result in critical media coverage, harm our business and reputation, and cause us to incur additional costs. In addition, if we, or our suppliers or foreign manufacturers, violate United States or foreign trade laws or regulations, we may be subject to additional duties, significant monetary penalties, the seizure and forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import or the loss of our import privileges.  Possible violations of United States or foreign laws or regulations could include inadequate record keeping of our imported products, misstatements or errors as to the origin, classification, marketing or valuation of our imported products, fraudulent visas or labor violations.  The effects of these factors could render our conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical and have a negative impact on our operating results. If we are unable to maintain working relationships with our major branded suppliers, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted.Our Famous Footwear segment purchases a substantial portion of its footwear products from major branded suppliers.  Purchases from one major branded supplier, Nike, Inc., comprises approximately 23% of sales for the Famous Footwear segment.  As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our suppliers.  In addition, the success of our financial performance is dependent on the ability of our Famous Footwear segment to obtain products from our suppliers on a timely basis and on acceptable terms.  While we believe our relationships with our current suppliers are good, the loss of any of our major suppliers or product developed exclusively for our Famous Footwear stores could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, negative trends in global economic conditions may adversely impact our suppliers.  If these third parties do not perform their obligations or are unable to provide us with the materials and services we need at prices and terms that are acceptable to us, our ability to meet our consumers’ demand could be adversely affected. Our reputation and competitive position are dependent on our ability to license well-recognized brands, license our own brands under successful licensing arrangements and protect our intellectual property rights.Licenses - Company as LicenseeAlthough we own most of our wholesale brands, we also rely on our ability to attract, retain and maintain good relationships with licensors that have strong, well-recognized brands and trademarks.  Our license agreements are generally for an initial term of two to four years, subject to renewal, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these licenses.  Even our longer-term or renewable licenses are typically dependent upon our ability to market and sell the licensed products at specified levels, and the failure to meet such levels may result in the termination or non-renewal of such licenses.  Furthermore, many of our license agreements require minimum royalty payments, and if we are unable to generate sufficient sales and profitability to cover these minimum royalty requirements, we may be required to make additional payments to the licensors that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  In addition, because certain of our license agreements are non-exclusive, new or existing competitors may obtain licenses with overlapping product or geographic terms, resulting in increased competition for a particular market. Licenses - Company as LicensorWe have entered into numerous license agreements with respect to the brands and trademarks that we own.  While we have significant control over our licensees’ products and advertising, we generally cannot control their operational and financial issues.  If our licensees are not able to meet annual sales and royalty goals, obtain financing, manage their supply chain, control quality and maintain positive relationships with their customers, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.  While we would likely have the ability to terminate an underperforming license, it may be difficult and costly to locate an acceptable substitute distributor or licensee, and we may experience a disruption in our sales and brand visibility.  In addition, although many of our license agreements prohibit the licensees from entering into licensing arrangements with certain of our competitors, they are generally not prohibited from offering, under other brands, the types of products covered by their license agreements with us. TrademarksWe believe that our trademarks and trade names are important to our success and competitive position because our distinctive marks create a market for our products and distinguish our products from other products.  We cannot, however, guarantee that we will be able to secure protection for our intellectual property in the future or that such protection will be adequate for future operations.  Furthermore, we face the risk of ineffective protection of intellectual property rights in jurisdictions where we source and distribute our products, some of which do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States.  If we are unsuccessful in challenging a party’s products on the basis of infringement of our intellectual property rights, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales, devalue our brands and result in a shift in consumer preference away from our products.  We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition could be adversely affected. Our retail business depends on our ability to secure affordable and desirable leased locations without creating a competitive concentration of stores.The success of the retail business within our Famous Footwear and Brand Portfolio segments depends, in part, on our ability to secure affordable, long-term leases in desirable locations for our leased retail footwear stores and to secure renewals of such leases.  As consumer shopping preferences have evolved, we continue to focus on opening stores in locations with a greater penetration of high-value consumers.  No assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully negotiate lease renewals for existing stores or obtain acceptable terms for new stores in desirable locations. In addition, opening new stores in our existing markets may result in reduced net sales in existing stores as our stores become more concentrated in the markets we serve.  As a result, the number of consumers and financial performance of individual stores may decline and the average sales per square foot at our stores may be reduced.  This may result in impairments that adversely impact our financial results.         12     Table of Contents Our quarterly sales and earnings may fluctuate, which may result in volatility in, or a decline in, our stock price.Our quarterly sales and earnings can vary due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:  •The recent COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the global economy.  Sales and earnings in the first quarter of 2020 have been adversely impacted by the pandemic, and may continue to be impacted during 2020.  •  Our Famous Footwear retail business is seasonally weighted to the back-to-school season, which primarily falls in our third fiscal quarter. As a result, the success of our back-to-school offering, which is affected by our ability to anticipate consumer demand and fashion trends, could have a disproportionate impact on our full year results.   •  In our wholesale business, sales of footwear are dependent on orders from our major customers, and they may change delivery schedules, change the mix of products they order or cancel orders without penalty.   •  Our wholesale customers have been moving toward lower initial orders and more replenishment orders, which may result in shifts of sales between quarters.   •  Our estimated annual tax rate is based on projections of our domestic and international operating results for the year, which we review and revise as necessary each quarter.   •  Our earnings are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, changes in product sales mix, geographic sales trends, weather conditions, consumer sentiment and currency exchange rate fluctuations.  As a result of these specific and other general factors, our operating results will vary from quarter to quarter and the results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year.  Any shortfall in sales or earnings from the levels expected by investors could cause a decrease in the trading price of our common stock. We are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in the unexpected expenditure of time and resources.We are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions (including environmental matters) relating to our business and to our past operations.  Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings.  An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are expensive and will require that we devote substantial resources and executive time to defend, thereby diverting management’s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.  See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for further discussion of pending matters. A significant portion of our Famous Footwear sales are dependent on our Famous Footwear loyalty program, Famously You Rewards (""Rewards""), and any decrease in sales from Rewards could have a material adverse impact on our sales.Rewards is a customer loyalty program that drives sales and traffic for the Famous Footwear segment.  Rewards members earn points toward savings certificates for qualifying purchases.  Upon reaching specified point values, members are issued a savings certificate, which may be redeemed for purchases at Famous Footwear.  Approximately 78% of our fiscal 2019 sales within the Famous Footwear segment were generated by our Rewards members.  If our Rewards members do not continue to shop at Famous Footwear, our sales may be adversely affected. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by the failure of financial institutions to fulfill their commitments under our Credit Agreement.The Third Amendment to our Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which matures on January 18, 2024, is provided by a syndicate of financial institutions, with each institution agreeing severally (and not jointly) to make revolving credit loans to us in an aggregate amount of up to $500.0 million in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.  In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for an increase at the Company's option by up to $250.0 million.  As a result of COVID-19, many companies are relying on bank funding for working capital needs.  If one or more of the financial institutions participating in the Credit Agreement were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment, the portion of the facility provided by such defaulting financial institution may not be available to us.   If we are unable to maintain our credit rating, our ability to access capital and interest rates may be negatively impacted.The credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings.  Any negative ratings actions, such as the March 2020 downgrades of our credit rating by Moody's and S&P, could constrain the capital available to us or our industry and could limit our access to long-term funding or cause such access to be available at a higher borrowing cost for our operations.  We are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive.  If our ability to access capital becomes constrained, our interest expense will likely increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, as of February 1, 2020, total borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement was $214.1 million.  Failure to meet our debt covenants under the Credit Agreement may require the Company to seek waivers or amendments of the debt covenants, alternative or additional sources of financing or reduce expenditures.         13     Table of

6,CAL,CALERES INC,2019-04-03,"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORSConsumer demand for our products may be adversely impacted by economic conditions and other factors.Worldwide economic conditions continue to be uncertain.  Consumer confidence and spending are strongly influenced by general economic conditions and other factors, including fiscal policy, the changing tax and regulatory environment, interest rates, minimum wage rates and regulations, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, the liquidity of consumers’ assets, health care costs, currency exchange rates, taxation, energy costs, real estate values, foreclosure rates, unemployment trends, weather conditions and the economic consequences of military action or terrorist activities.  Negative economic conditions generally decrease disposable income and, consequently, consumer purchases of discretionary items like our products.  Negative trends in economic conditions could also drive up the cost of our products, which may require us to increase our product prices.  These increases in our product costs, and possibly prices, may not be offset by comparable increases in consumer disposable income.  As a result, our customers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or purchase the lower priced products of our competitors, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.If we are unable to anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends and successfully apply new technology, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net sales and earnings.The footwear industry is subject to rapidly changing consumer shopping preferences and patterns and fashion trends.  Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change.  In addition, the continuing consumer shift to online and mobile shopping is requiring retailers to lower shipping costs, improve shipping speeds and optimize mobile platforms.  The trend toward online and mobile shopping increases the volume of smaller shipments, including single-pair shipments, from our warehouses.  The increased volume of smaller shipments may result in higher average distribution costs, including both shipping and processing costs incurred at our distribution centers.  The success of both our wholesale and retail operations depends largely on our ability to anticipate, understand and react to these changing consumer shopping patterns.  If we fail to respond to changes in consumer shopping patterns, demands and fashion trends, develop new products and designs, and implement effective, responsive merchandising and distribution strategies and programs, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories and lower gross margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We operate in a highly competitive industry.Competition is intense in the footwear industry.  There has also been consolidation of competitors in the industry, resulting in certain competitors that are larger and have greater financial, marketing and technological resources than we do.  Other competitors are able to offer footwear on a lateral basis alongside their apparel products, or have successfully branded their trademarks as lifestyle brands, resulting in greater competitive advantages.  Low barriers to entry into this industry further intensify competition by allowing new companies to easily enter the markets in which we compete.  Some of our suppliers further compound these competitive pressures by allowing consumers to purchase their products directly through supplier-maintained Internet sites and retail stores.  In addition, retailers aggressively compete on the basis of price, which puts competitive pressure on us to keep our prices low.We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the footwear industry depends on a number of factors, including style, price, performance, quality, location and service, as well as the strength of our brand names.  We remain competitive by increasing awareness of our brands, improving the efficiency of our supply chain and enhancing the style, comfort, fashion and perceived value of our products.  However, our competitors may implement more effective marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, make more attractive offers to potential employees, distribution partners and manufacturers, or respond more quickly to changes in consumer preferences than us.  As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand the development and marketing of our products, which could adversely impact our financial results.We rely primarily on foreign sources of production, which subjects our business to risks associated with international trade.11We rely primarily on foreign sourcing for our footwear products through third-party manufacturing facilities located outside the United States.  As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our third-party foreign manufacturers.  Foreign sourcing is subject to numerous risks, including trade relations, work stoppages, transportation delays (including delays at foreign and domestic ports) and costs (including customs duties, quotas, tariffs, anti-dumping duties, safeguard measures, cargo restrictions or other trade restrictions), domestic and foreign political instability, foreign currency fluctuations, variable economic conditions, expropriation, nationalization, natural disasters, terrorist acts and military conflict, changes in governmental regulations (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) and geo-political events (including the potential impact of the impending withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, or ""Brexit"").  At the same time, potential changes in manufacturing preferences, including, but not limited to the following, pose additional risk and uncertainty:•Manufacturing capacity may shift from footwear to other industries with manufacturing margins that are perceived to be higher. •Some footwear manufacturers may face labor shortages as workers seek better wages and working conditions in other industries and locations.As a result of these risks, there can be no assurance that we will not experience reductions in available production capacity, increases in our product costs, late deliveries or terminations of our supplier relationships.  Furthermore, these sourcing risks are compounded by the lack of diversification in the geographic location of our foreign sourcing and manufacturing.  With the majority of our supply originating in China, a substantial portion of our supply could be at risk in the event of any significant negative development related to relations between United States and China.Although we believe we could find alternative manufacturing sources for the products that we currently source from third-party manufacturing facilities in China or other countries, we may not be able to locate alternative manufacturers on terms as favorable as our current terms, including pricing, payment terms, manufacturing capacity, quality standards and lead times for delivery.  In addition, there is substantial competition in the footwear industry for quality footwear manufacturers.  Accordingly, our future results will partly depend on our ability to maintain positive working relationships with, and offer competitive terms to, our foreign manufacturers.  If supply issues cause us to be unable to provide products consistent with our standards or manufacture our footwear in an efficient and cost-effective manner, our customers may cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reductions in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The imposition of tariffs on our products may result in higher costs and decreased gross profits. Recent international events have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade wars and tariffs, which may affect trade between the United States and other countries, particularly with China. We rely primarily on foreign sourcing for our footwear through third-party manufacturing facilities located outside the United States, with over 60% of our footwear sourced from manufacturing facilities in China.  The imposition of tariffs on imported products may result in an increase in product prices, which may in turn adversely impact our gross margins if we are unable to pass along the higher costs to the consumer. Our operating results depend on preparing accurate sales forecasts and properly managing our inventory levels.Using sales forecasts, we place orders with manufacturers for some of our products prior to the time we receive all of our customers’ orders to minimize purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non-delivery.  We also maintain an inventory of certain products that we anticipate will be in greater demand.  At the retail level, we place orders for products many months in advance of our key selling seasons.  Adverse economic conditions and rapidly changing consumer preferences can make it difficult for us and our retail customers to accurately forecast product trends in order to match production with demand.  If we fail to accurately assess consumer fashion tastes and the impact of economic factors on consumer spending or to effectively differentiate our retail and wholesale offerings, our inventory levels may exceed customer demand, resulting in inventory write-downs, higher carrying costs, lower gross margins or the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could significantly impact our financial results.  Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply the quality products that we require in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages.  Inventory shortages may delay shipments to customers (and possibly require us to offer discounts or costly expedited shipping), negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships, adversely impact our sales results and diminish brand awareness and loyalty.We are reliant upon our information technology systems, and any major disruption of these systems could adversely impact our ability to effectively operate our business.Our computer network and systems are essential to all aspects of our operations, including design, pricing, production, accounting, reporting, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution.  Our ability to manage and maintain our inventory and to deliver products in a timely manner depends on these systems.  If any of these systems fails to operate as expected, we experience problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, a breach in security occurs or a natural disaster interrupts system 12functions, we may experience delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency in our operations or be required to expend significant capital to correct the problem, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.A cybersecurity breach may adversely affect our sales and reputation.We routinely possess sensitive consumer and associate information and periodically provide it to third parties for analysis, benefit distribution or compliance purposes.  While we believe we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect that information, hackers and data thieves operate sophisticated, large-scale attacks that could breach our information systems, despite ongoing security measures.  In addition, we are required to comply with increasingly complex regulations designed to protect our business and personal data.  Any breach of our network security, a third-party’s network security or failure to comply with applicable regulations may result in (a) the loss of valuable business data and/or our consumers’ or associates’ personal information, (b) increased costs associated with implementing additional protections and processes, (c) a disruption of our business and a loss of sales, (d) negative media attention, (e) damage to our consumer and associate relationships and reputation, and (f) fines or lawsuits.Customer concentration and other trends in customer behavior may lead to a reduction in or loss of sales.Our wholesale customers include national chains, online retailers, department stores, mass merchandisers, independent retailers and catalogs. Several of our customers operate multiple department store divisions.  Furthermore, we often sell multiple types of branded, licensed and private-label footwear to these same customers.  While we believe purchasing decisions in many cases are made independently by the buyers and merchandisers of each of the customers, a decision by a significant customer to decrease the amount of footwear products purchased from us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.In addition, with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, including store count reductions at major retail chains, and consumers' continued shift to online shopping, we and our wholesale customers increasingly depend upon a reduced number of key retailers whose bargaining strength is growing.  This consolidation may result in the following adverse consequences:•Our wholesale customers may seek more favorable terms for their purchases of our products, which could limit our ability to raise prices, recoup cost increases or achieve our profit goals. •The number of stores that carry our products could decline, thereby exposing us to a greater concentration of accounts receivable risk and negatively impacting our brand visibility.We also face the following risks with respect to our customers:•Our customers could develop in-house brands or use a higher mix of private-label footwear products, which would negatively impact our sales.•As we sell our products to customers and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer’s financial condition, the financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to stop doing business with that customer, reduce our business with that customer or be unable to collect from that customer.•Since we transact primarily in United States dollars, our international customers could purchase from competitors who will transact business in their local currency.  •Certain of our major wholesale customers have experienced a significant downturn or disruption in their business. If our remaining customers fail to remain committed to our products or brands or also experience significant downturns or disruptions in their business, then these customers may reduce or discontinue purchases from us.•Retailers are directly sourcing more of their products directly from foreign manufacturers and reducing their reliance on wholesalers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Transitional challenges with acquisitions could result in unexpected expenditures of time and resources.Periodically, we pursue acquisitions of other companies or businesses, such as our 2016 acquisition of Allen Edmonds and our 2018 acquisitions of Blowfish Malibu and Vionic, as further discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.  Although we review the records of acquisition candidates, the review may not reveal all existing or potential problems.  As a result, we may not accurately assess the value of the business and may, accordingly, ultimately assume unknown adverse operating conditions and/or unanticipated liabilities.  Acquisitions may also cause us to incur debt, write-offs of goodwill or intangible assets if the business does not perform as well as expected and substantial amortization expenses associated with other intangible assets.  We face the risk that the returns on acquisitions will not support the expenditures or indebtedness incurred to acquire or launch such businesses.  We also face the risk that we will not be able to integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense, delay or other operational or financial problems.  Integration may be hindered by, among other things, differing procedures, including internal controls, business practices and technology systems.  We may need to allocate more management resources to integration than we planned, which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other profitable activities.13A disruption in the effective functioning of our distribution centers could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis.We currently use several distribution centers, which are leased or third-party managed.  These distribution centers serve as the source of replenishment of inventory for our footwear stores and e-commerce websites operated by our Famous Footwear and Brand Portfolio segments and serve the wholesale operations of our Brand Portfolio segment.  Our success depends on our ability to handle the rapid consumer shift to online shopping and single pair shipments, which requires significant capital to operate with a greater level of sophistication and automation, as well as higher processing and distribution costs.  We may be unable to successfully manage, negotiate or renew our third-party distribution center agreements, or we may experience complications with respect to our distribution centers, such as substantial damage to, or destruction of, such facilities due to natural disasters or ineffective information technology systems.  In such an event, our other distribution centers may not be able to support the resulting additional distribution demands and we may be unable to locate alternative persons or entities capable of fulfilling our distribution needs, resulting in an adverse effect on our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis.Foreign currency fluctuations may result in higher costs and decreased gross profits.Although we purchase most of our products from foreign manufacturers in United States dollars and otherwise engage in foreign currency hedging transactions, we cannot ensure that we will not experience cost variations with respect to exchange rate changes.  Currency exchange rate fluctuations may also adversely impact third parties who manufacture the Company’s products by making their purchases of raw materials or other production costs more expensive and more difficult to finance, resulting in higher prices and lower margins for the Company, its distributors and licensees.Changes in tax laws may result in increased volatility in our effective tax rates.Our financial results are significantly impacted by the effective tax rates of both our domestic and international operations.  Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by certain provisions of  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Act""), which was enacted in December 2017, that directly affect foreign earnings, such as the global intangible low-taxed income tax (""GILTI"") and base-erosion and anti-abuse tax provisions (""BEAT"").  Other factors, such as changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in permitted deductions, changes in tax laws, interpretations, policies and treaties and the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions, may result in higher taxes, lower profitability and increased volatility in our financial results. Our success depends on our ability to retain senior management and recruit and retain other key associates.Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified management, administrative, product development and sales personnel to support existing operations and future growth.  In addition, our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses often depends on our ability to retain incumbent personnel, many of whom possess valuable institutional knowledge and operating experience.  Competition for qualified personnel in the footwear industry is intense and we compete for these individuals with other companies that in many cases have superior financial and other resources.  The loss of the services of any member of our senior management or key associates, the inability to attract and retain other qualified personnel or the inability to effectively transition positions could adversely affect the sales, design and production of our products as well as the implementation of our strategic initiatives.Our business, sales and brand value could be harmed by violations of labor, trade or other laws.We focus on doing business with those suppliers who share our commitment to responsible business practices and the principles set forth in our Production Code of Conduct (the “PCOC”).  By requiring our suppliers to comply with the PCOC, we encourage our suppliers to promote best practices and work toward continual improvement throughout their production operations.  The PCOC sets forth standards for working conditions and other matters, including compliance with applicable labor practices, workplace environment and compliance with laws.  Although we promote ethical business practices, we do not control our suppliers or their labor practices.  A failure by any of our suppliers to adhere to these standards or laws could cause us to incur additional costs for our products or cause negative publicity and harm our business and reputation.  We also require our suppliers to meet our standards for product safety, including compliance with applicable laws and standards with respect to safety issues, including lead content in paint.  Failure by any of our suppliers to adhere to product safety standards could lead to a product recall, which may result in critical media coverage, harm our business and reputation, and cause us to incur additional costs.In addition, if we, or our suppliers or foreign manufacturers, violate United States or foreign trade laws or regulations, we may be subject to additional duties, significant monetary penalties, the seizure and forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import or the loss of our import privileges.  Possible violations of United States or foreign laws or regulations could include inadequate record keeping of our imported products, misstatements or errors as to the origin, classification, marketing or valuation of our imported products, fraudulent visas or labor violations.  The effects of these factors could render our conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical and have a negative impact on our operating results.14Our retail business depends on our ability to secure affordable and desirable leased locations without creating a competitive concentration of stores.The success of the retail business within our Famous Footwear and Brand Portfolio segments depends, in part, on our ability to secure affordable, long-term leases in desirable locations for our leased retail footwear stores and to secure renewals of such leases.  As consumer shopping preferences have evolved, we continue to focus on opening stores in locations with a greater penetration of high-value consumers.  No assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully negotiate lease renewals for existing stores or obtain acceptable terms for new stores in desirable locations.  In addition, opening new stores in our existing markets may result in reduced net sales in existing stores as our stores become more concentrated in the markets we serve.  As a result, the number of consumers and financial performance of individual stores may decline and the average sales per square foot at our stores may be reduced.  This may result in impairments that   adversely impact our financial results.  As further discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, we will adopt Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") Topic 842, Leases, during the first quarter of 2019.  Impairment charges related to underperforming retail stores are expected to be greater under the new standard.If we are unable to maintain working relationships with our major branded suppliers, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted.Our Famous Footwear segment purchases a substantial portion of its footwear products from major branded suppliers.  Purchases from two major branded suppliers, Nike, Inc. and Skechers USA, Inc., comprise approximately 22% and 10%, respectively, of sales for the Famous Footwear segment.  As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our suppliers.  In addition, the success of our financial performance is dependent on the ability of our Famous Footwear segment to obtain products from our suppliers on a timely basis and on acceptable terms.  While we believe our relationships with our current suppliers are good, the loss of any of our major suppliers or product developed exclusively for our Famous Footwear stores could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, negative trends in global economic conditions may adversely impact our suppliers.  If these third parties do not perform their obligations or are unable to provide us with the materials and services we need at prices and terms that are acceptable to us, our ability to meet our consumers’ demand could be adversely affected.Our reputation and competitive position are dependent on our ability to license well-recognized brands, license our own brands under successful licensing arrangements and protect our intellectual property rights.Licenses - Company as LicenseeAlthough we own most of our wholesale brands, we also rely on our ability to attract, retain and maintain good relationships with licensors that have strong, well-recognized brands and trademarks.  Our license agreements are generally for an initial term of two to four years, subject to renewal, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these licenses.  Even our longer-term or renewable licenses are typically dependent upon our ability to market and sell the licensed products at specified levels, and the failure to meet such levels may result in the termination or non-renewal of such licenses.  Furthermore, many of our license agreements require minimum royalty payments, and if we are unable to generate sufficient sales and profitability to cover these minimum royalty requirements, we may be required to make additional payments to the licensors that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  In addition, because certain of our license agreements are non-exclusive, new or existing competitors may obtain licenses with overlapping product or geographic terms, resulting in increased competition for a particular market.Licenses - Company as LicensorWe have entered into numerous license agreements with respect to the brands and trademarks that we own.  While we have significant control over our licensees’ products and advertising, we generally cannot control their operational and financial issues.  If our licensees are not able to meet annual sales and royalty goals, obtain financing, manage their supply chain, control quality and maintain positive relationships with their customers, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.  While we would likely have the ability to terminate an underperforming license, it may be difficult and costly to locate an acceptable substitute distributor or licensee, and we may experience a disruption in our sales and brand visibility.  In addition, although many of our license agreements prohibit the licensees from entering into licensing arrangements with certain of our competitors, they are generally not prohibited from offering, under other brands, the types of products covered by their license agreements with us.15TrademarksWe believe that our trademarks and trade names are important to our success and competitive position because our distinctive marks create a market for our products and distinguish our products from other products.  We cannot, however, guarantee that we will be able to secure protection for our intellectual property in the future or that such protection will be adequate for future operations.  Furthermore, we face the risk of ineffective protection of intellectual property rights in jurisdictions where we source and distribute our products, some of which do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States.  If we are unsuccessful in challenging a party’s products on the basis of infringement of our intellectual property rights, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales, devalue our brands and result in a shift in consumer preference away from our products.  We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition could be adversely affected.Our quarterly sales and earnings may fluctuate, which may result in volatility in, or a decline in, our stock price.Our quarterly sales and earnings can vary due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:•Our Famous Footwear retail business is seasonally weighted to the back-to-school season, which primarily falls in our third fiscal quarter.  As a result, the success of our back-to-school offering, which is affected by our ability to anticipate consumer demand and fashion trends, could have a disproportionate impact on our full year results. •In our wholesale business, sales of footwear are dependent on orders from our major customers, and they may change delivery schedules, change the mix of products they order or cancel orders without penalty. •Our wholesale customers set the delivery schedule for shipments of our products, which could cause shifts of sales between quarters. •Our estimated annual tax rate is based on projections of our domestic and international operating results for the year, which we review and revise as necessary each quarter.•Our earnings are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, changes in product sales mix, geographic sales trends, weather conditions, consumer sentiment and currency exchange rate fluctuations. As a result of these specific and other general factors, our operating results will vary from quarter to quarter and the results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year.  Any shortfall in sales or earnings from the levels expected by investors could cause a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.We are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in the unexpected expenditure of time and resources.We are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions (including environmental matters) relating to our business and to our past operations.  Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings.  An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are expensive and will require that we devote substantial resources and executive time to defend, thereby diverting management’s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.  See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for further discussion of pending matters.A significant portion of our Famous Footwear sales are dependent on our Famous Footwear loyalty program, Rewards, and any decrease in sales from Rewards could have a material adverse impact on our sales.Rewards is a customer loyalty program that drives sales and traffic for the Famous Footwear segment.  Rewards members earn points toward savings certificates for qualifying purchases.  Upon reaching specified point values, members are issued a savings certificate, which may be redeemed for purchases at Famous Footwear.  Approximately 76% of our fiscal 2018 sales within the Famous Footwear segment were generated by our Rewards members.  If our Rewards members do not continue to shop at Famous Footwear, our sales may be adversely affected.Our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by the failure of financial institutions to fulfill their commitments under our Credit Agreement.The Third Amendment to our Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which matures on January 18, 2024, is provided by a syndicate of financial institutions, with each institution agreeing severally (and not jointly) to make revolving credit loans to us in an aggregate amount of up to $500.0 million in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.  In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for an increase at the Company's option by up to $250.0 million.  If one or more of the financial institutions participating in the Credit Agreement were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment, the portion of the facility provided by such defaulting financial institution might not be available to us.16If we are unable to maintain our credit rating, our ability to access capital and interest rates may be negatively impacted.The credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings.  Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to us or our industry and could limit our access to long-term funding or cause such access to be available at a higher borrowing cost for our operations.  We are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive.  If our ability to access capital becomes constrained, our interest expense will likely increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, as of February 2, 2019, total borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement was $154.5 million.  Failure to meet our debt covenants under the Credit Agreement may require the Company to seek waivers or amendments of the debt covenants, alternative or additional sources of financing or reduce expenditures.   "
4,CAL,CALERES INC,2018-04-04,"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORSConsumer demand for our products may be adversely impacted by economic conditions and other factors.Worldwide economic conditions continue to be uncertain.  Consumer confidence and spending are strongly influenced by general economic conditions and other factors, including fiscal policy, the changing tax and regulatory environment, interest rates, minimum wage rates and regulations, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, the liquidity of consumers’ assets, health care costs, currency exchange rates, taxation, energy costs, real estate values, foreclosure rates, unemployment trends, weather conditions and the economic consequences of military action or terrorist activities.  Negative economic conditions generally decrease disposable income 10and, consequently, consumer purchases of discretionary items like our products.  Negative trends in economic conditions could also drive up the cost of our products, which may require us to increase our product prices.  These increases in our product costs, and possibly prices, may not be offset by comparable increases in consumer disposable income.  As a result, our customers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or purchase the lower-priced products of our competitors, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.If we are unable to anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends and successfully apply new technology, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net sales and earnings.The footwear industry is subject to rapidly changing consumer shopping preferences and patterns and fashion trends.  Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change.  In addition, the continuing consumer shift to online and mobile shopping is requiring retailers to lower shipping costs, improve shipping speeds and optimize mobile platforms.  The trend toward online and mobile shopping increases the volume of smaller shipments, including single-pair shipments, from our warehouses.  The increased volume of smaller shipments may result in higher average distribution costs, including both shipping and processing costs incurred at our distribution centers.  The success of both our wholesale and retail operations depends largely on our ability to anticipate, understand and react to these changing consumer shopping patterns.  If we fail to respond to changes in consumer shopping patterns, demands and fashion trends, develop new products and designs, and implement effective, responsive merchandising and distribution strategies and programs, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories and lower gross margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We operate in a highly competitive industry.Competition is intense in the footwear industry.  Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater financial, marketing and technological resources than we do.  Other competitors are able to offer footwear on a lateral basis alongside their apparel products, or have successfully branded their trademarks as lifestyle brands, resulting in greater competitive advantages.  Low barriers to entry into this industry further intensify competition by allowing new companies to easily enter the markets in which we compete.  Some of our suppliers further compound these competitive pressures by allowing consumers to purchase their products directly through supplier-maintained Internet sites and retail stores.  In addition, retailers aggressively compete on the basis of price, which puts competitive pressure on us to keep our prices low.We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the footwear industry depends on a number of factors, including style, price, performance, quality, location and service, as well as the strength of our brand names.  We remain competitive by increasing awareness of our brands, improving the efficiency of our supply chain and enhancing the style, comfort, fashion and perceived value of our products.  However, our competitors may implement more effective marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, make more attractive offers to potential employees, distribution partners and manufacturers, or respond more quickly to changes in consumer preferences than us.  As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand the development and marketing of our products, which could adversely impact our financial results.We rely primarily on foreign sources of production, which subjects our business to risks associated with international trade.We rely primarily on foreign sourcing for our footwear products through third-party manufacturing facilities located outside the United States.  As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our third-party foreign manufacturers.  Foreign sourcing is subject to numerous risks, including trade relations, work stoppages, transportation delays (including delays at foreign and domestic ports) and costs (including customs duties, quotas, tariffs, anti-dumping duties, safeguard measures, cargo restrictions or other trade restrictions), domestic and foreign political instability, foreign currency fluctuations, variable economic conditions, expropriation, nationalization, natural disasters, terrorist acts and military conflict and changes in governmental regulations (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act).  At the same time, potential changes in manufacturing preferences, including, but not limited to the following, pose additional risk and uncertainty:•Manufacturing capacity may shift from footwear to other industries with manufacturing margins that are perceived to be higher. •Some footwear manufacturers may face labor shortages as workers seek better wages and working conditions in other industries and locations.As a result of these risks, there can be no assurance that we will not experience reductions in available production capacity, increases in our product costs, late deliveries or terminations of our supplier relationships.  Furthermore, these sourcing risks are compounded by the lack of diversification in the geographic location of our foreign sourcing and manufacturing.  With the majority of our supply originating in China, a substantial portion of our supply could be at risk in the event of any significant negative development related to relations between United States and China.11Although we believe we could find alternative manufacturing sources for the products that we currently source from third-party manufacturing facilities in China or other countries, we may not be able to locate alternative manufacturers on terms as favorable as our current terms, including pricing, payment terms, manufacturing capacity, quality standards and lead times for delivery.  In addition, there is substantial competition in the footwear industry for quality footwear manufacturers.  Accordingly, our future results will partly depend on our ability to maintain positive working relationships with, and offer competitive terms to, our foreign manufacturers.  If supply issues cause us to be unable to provide products consistent with our standards or manufacture our footwear in an efficient and cost-effective manner, our customers may cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reductions in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Foreign currency fluctuations may result in higher costs and decreased gross profits.Although we purchase most of our products from foreign manufacturers in United States dollars and otherwise engage in foreign currency hedging transactions, we cannot ensure that we will not experience cost variations with respect to exchange rate changes.  Currency exchange rate fluctuations may also adversely impact third parties who manufacture the Company’s products by making their purchases of raw materials or other production costs more expensive and more difficult to finance, resulting in higher prices and lower margins for the Company, its distributors and licensees.Our operating results depend on preparing accurate sales forecasts and properly managing our inventory levels.Using sales forecasts, we place orders with manufacturers for some of our products prior to the time we receive all of our customers’ orders to minimize purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non-delivery.

Inventory shortages may delay shipments to customers (and possibly require us to offer discounts or costly expedited shipping), negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships, adversely impact our sales results and diminish brand awareness and loyalty.We are reliant upon our information technology systems, and any major disruption of these systems could adversely impact our ability to effectively operate our business.Our computer network and systems are essential to all aspects of our operations, including design, pricing, production, accounting, reporting, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution.  Our ability to manage and maintain our inventory and to deliver products in a timely manner depends on these systems.  If any of these systems fails to operate as expected, we experience problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, a breach in security occurs or a natural disaster interrupts system functions, we may experience delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency in our operations or be required to expend significant capital to correct the problem, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.A cybersecurity breach may adversely affect our sales and reputation.We routinely possess sensitive consumer and associate information and periodically provide it to third parties for analysis, benefit distribution or compliance purposes.  While we believe we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect that information, hackers and data thieves operate sophisticated, large-scale attacks that could breach our information systems, despite ongoing security measures.  In addition, we are required to comply with increasingly complex regulations designed to protect our business and personal data.  Any breach of our network security, a third-party’s network security or failure to comply with applicable regulations may result in (a) the loss of valuable business data and/or our consumers’ or associates’ personal information, (b) increased costs associated with implementing additional protections and processes, (c) a disruption of our business and a loss of sales, (d) negative media attention, (e) damage to our consumer and associate relationships and reputation, and (f) fines or lawsuits.Customer concentration and other trends in customer behavior may lead to a reduction in or loss of sales.Our wholesale customers include national chains, online retailers, department stores, mass merchandisers, independent retailers and catalogs. Several of our customers operate multiple department store divisions.  Furthermore, we often sell multiple types of branded, licensed and private-label footwear to these same customers.  While we believe purchasing decisions in many cases are made independently by the buyers and merchandisers of each of the customers, a decision by a significant customer to decrease the amount of footwear products purchased from us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.12In addition, with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, including store count reductions at major retail chains, and consumers' continued shift to online shopping, we and our wholesale customers increasingly depend upon a reduced number of key retailers whose bargaining strength is growing.  This consolidation may result in the following adverse consequences:•Our wholesale customers may seek more favorable terms for their purchases of our products, which could limit our ability to raise prices, recoup cost increases or achieve our profit goals. •The number of stores that carry our products could decline, thereby exposing us to a greater concentration of accounts receivable risk and negatively impacting our brand visibility.We also face the following risks with respect to our customers:•Our customers could develop in-house brands or use a higher mix of private-label footwear products, which would negatively impact our sales.•As we sell our products to customers and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer’s financial condition, the financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to stop doing business with that customer, reduce our business with that customer or be unable to collect from that customer.•Since we transact primarily in United States dollars, our international customers could purchase from competitors who will transact business in their local currency.  •If any of our major wholesale customers experiences a significant downturn or disruption in its business or fails to remain committed to our products or brands, then these customers may reduce or discontinue purchases from us.•Retailers are directly sourcing more of their products directly from foreign manufacturers and reducing their reliance on wholesalers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Transitional challenges with acquisitions could result in unexpected expenditures of time and resources.Periodically, we pursue acquisitions of other companies or businesses, such as our 2016 acquisition of Allen Edmonds, as further discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.  Although we review the records of acquisition candidates, the review may not reveal all existing or potential problems.  As a result, we may not accurately assess the value of the business and may, accordingly, ultimately assume unknown adverse operating conditions and/or unanticipated liabilities.  Acquisitions may also cause us to incur debt, write-offs of goodwill if the business does not perform as well as expected and substantial amortization expenses associated with other intangible assets.  We face the risk that the returns on acquisitions will not support the expenditures or indebtedness incurred to acquire or launch such businesses.  We also face the risk that we will not be able to integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense, delay or other operational or financial problems.  Integration may be hindered by, among other things, differing procedures, including internal controls, business practices and technology systems.  We may need to allocate more management resources to integration than we planned, which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other profitable activities.A disruption in the effective functioning of our distribution centers could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis.We currently use several distribution centers, which are leased or third-party managed.  These distribution centers serve as the source of replenishment of inventory for our footwear stores and e-commerce websites operated by our Famous Footwear and Brand Portfolio segments and serve the wholesale operations of our Brand Portfolio segment.  Our success depends on our ability to handle the rapid consumer shift to online shopping and single pair shipments, which requires significant capital to operate with a greater level of sophistication and automation, as well as higher processing and distribution costs.  We may be unable to successfully manage, negotiate or renew our third-party distribution center agreements, or we may experience complications with respect to our distribution centers, such as substantial damage to, or destruction of, such facilities due to natural disasters or ineffective information technology systems.  In such an event, our other distribution centers may not be able to support the resulting additional distribution demands and we may be unable to locate alternative persons or entities capable of fulfilling our distribution needs, resulting in an adverse effect on our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis.Recent changes in tax laws may result in increased volatility in our effective tax rates.Our financial results are significantly impacted by the effective tax rates of both our domestic and international operations.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Act""), which was enacted in December 2017, reduced the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%.  Our future earnings could be adversely affected by the change from a worldwide tax system to a quasi-territorial tax system.  Other changes in the Act also impact our effective tax rate, such as the permanent non-deductibility of certain expenses and generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries.  One-time changes of the Act include a deemed repatriation transition tax on certain foreign earnings and a requirement to revalue our deferred tax assets and liabilities.  In addition, our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by other provisions of the Act that directly affect foreign earnings, such as the global intangible low-taxed income tax and base-erosion and anti-abuse tax provisions.  The Treasury Department has announced the intention to release announcements and regulations 13clarifying the Act that could have a material effect on our effective tax rate.  Other factors, such as changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in permitted deductions, changes in tax laws, interpretations, policies and treaties and the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions, may result in higher taxes, lower profitability and increased volatility in our financial results. Our success depends on our ability to retain senior management and recruit and retain other key associates.Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified management, administrative, product development and sales personnel to support existing operations and future growth.  In addition, our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses often depends on our ability to retain incumbent personnel, many of whom possess valuable institutional knowledge and operating experience.  Competition for qualified personnel in the footwear industry is intense and we compete for these individuals with other companies that in many cases have superior financial and other resources.  The loss of the services of any member of our senior management or key associates, the inability to attract and retain other qualified personnel or the inability to effectively transition positions could adversely affect the sales, design and production of our products as well as the implementation of our strategic initiatives.Our business, sales and brand value could be harmed by violations of labor, trade or other laws.We focus on doing business with those suppliers who share our commitment to responsible business practices and the principles set forth in our Production Code of Conduct (the “PCOC”).  By requiring our suppliers to comply with the PCOC, we encourage our suppliers to promote best practices and work toward continual improvement throughout their production operations.  The PCOC sets forth standards for working conditions and other matters, including compliance with applicable labor practices, workplace environment and compliance with laws.  Although we promote ethical business practices, we do not control our suppliers or their labor practices.  A failure by any of our suppliers to adhere to these standards or laws could cause us to incur additional costs for our products or cause negative publicity and harm our business and reputation.  We also require our suppliers to meet our standards for product safety, including compliance with applicable laws and standards with respect to safety issues, including lead content in paint.  Failure by any of our suppliers to adhere to product safety standards could lead to a product recall, which may result in critical media coverage, harm our business and reputation, and cause us to incur additional costs.In addition, if we, or our suppliers or foreign manufacturers, violate United States or foreign trade laws or regulations, we may be subject to additional duties, significant monetary penalties, the seizure and forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import or the loss of our import privileges.  Possible violations of United States or foreign laws or regulations could include inadequate record keeping of our imported products, misstatements or errors as to the origin, classification, marketing or valuation of our imported products, fraudulent visas or labor violations.  The effects of these factors could render our conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical and have a negative impact on our operating results.Our retail business depends on our ability to secure affordable and desirable leased locations without creating a competitive concentration of stores.The success of the retail business within our Famous Footwear and Brand Portfolio segments depends, in part, on our ability to secure affordable, long-term leases in desirable locations for our leased retail footwear stores and to secure renewals of such leases.  As consumer shopping preferences have evolved, we continue to focus on opening stores in locations with a greater penetration of high-value consumers.  No assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully negotiate lease renewals for existing stores or obtain acceptable terms for new stores in desirable locations.  In addition, opening new stores in our existing markets may result in reduced net sales in existing stores as our stores become more concentrated in the markets we serve.  As a result, the number of consumers and financial performance of individual stores may decline and the average sales per square foot at our stores may be reduced.If we are unable to maintain working relationships with our major branded suppliers, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted.Our Famous Footwear segment purchases a substantial portion of its footwear products from major branded suppliers.  Purchases from two major branded suppliers, Nike, Inc. and Skechers USA, Inc., collectively comprise approximately 25% and 10%, respectively, of sales for the Famous Footwear segment.  As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our suppliers.  In addition, the success of our financial performance is dependent on the ability of our Famous Footwear segment to obtain products from our suppliers on a timely basis and on acceptable terms.  While we believe our relationships with our current suppliers are good, the loss of any of our major suppliers or product developed exclusively for our Famous Footwear stores could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, negative trends in global economic conditions may adversely impact our suppliers.  If these third parties do not perform their obligations or are unable to provide us with the materials and services we need at prices and terms that are acceptable to us, our ability to meet our consumers’ demand could be adversely affected.14Our reputation and competitive position are dependent on our ability to license well-recognized brands, license our own brands under successful licensing arrangements and protect our intellectual property rights.Licenses - Company as LicenseeAlthough we own most of our wholesale brands, we also rely on our ability to attract, retain and maintain good relationships with licensors that have strong, well-recognized brands and trademarks.  Our license agreements are generally for an initial term of two to four years, subject to renewal, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these licenses.  Even our longer-term or renewable licenses are typically dependent upon our ability to market and sell the licensed products at specified levels, and the failure to meet such levels may result in the termination or non-renewal of such licenses.  Furthermore, many of our license agreements require minimum royalty payments, and if we are unable to generate sufficient sales and profitability to cover these minimum royalty requirements, we may be required to make additional payments to the licensors that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  In addition, because certain of our license agreements are non-exclusive, new or existing competitors may obtain licenses with overlapping product or geographic terms, resulting in increased competition for a particular market.Licenses - Company as LicensorWe have entered into numerous license agreements with respect to the brands and trademarks that we own.  While we have significant control over our licensees’ products and advertising, we generally cannot control their operational and financial issues.  If our licensees are not able to meet annual sales and royalty goals, obtain financing, manage their supply chain, control quality and maintain positive relationships with their customers, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.  While we would likely have the ability to terminate an underperforming license, it may be difficult and costly to locate an acceptable substitute distributor or licensee, and we may experience a disruption in our sales and brand visibility.  In addition, although many of our license agreements prohibit the licensees from entering into licensing arrangements with certain of our competitors, they are generally not prohibited from offering, under other brands, the types of products covered by their license agreements with us.TrademarksWe believe that our trademarks and trade names are important to our success and competitive position because our distinctive marks create a market for our products and distinguish our products from other products.  We cannot, however, guarantee that we will be able to secure protection for our intellectual property in the future or that such protection will be adequate for future operations.  Furthermore, we face the risk of ineffective protection of intellectual property rights in jurisdictions where we source and distribute our products, some of which do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States.  If we are unsuccessful in challenging a party’s products on the basis of infringement of our intellectual property rights, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales, devalue our brands and result in a shift in consumer preference away from our products.  We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition could be adversely affected.Our quarterly sales and earnings may fluctuate, which may result in volatility in, or a decline in, our stock price.Our quarterly sales and earnings can vary due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:•Our Famous Footwear retail business is seasonally weighted to the back-to-school season, which falls in our third fiscal quarter.  As a result, the success of our back-to-school offering, which is affected by our ability to anticipate consumer demand and fashion trends, could have a disproportionate impact on our full year results. •In our wholesale business, sales of footwear are dependent on orders from our major customers, and they may change delivery schedules, change the mix of products they order or cancel orders without penalty. •Our wholesale customers set the delivery schedule for shipments of our products, which could cause shifts of sales between quarters. •Our estimated annual tax rate is based on projections of our domestic and international operating results for the year, which we review and revise as necessary each quarter.•Our earnings are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, changes in product sales mix, geographic sales trends, weather conditions, consumer sentiment and currency exchange rate fluctuations. As a result of these specific and other general factors, our operating results will vary from quarter to quarter and the results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year.  Any shortfall in sales or earnings from the levels expected by investors could cause a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.15We are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in the unexpected expenditure of time and resources.We are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions (including environmental matters) relating to our business and to our past operations.  Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings.  An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are expensive and will require that we devote substantial resources and executive time to defend, thereby diverting management’s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.  See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for further discussion of pending matters.A significant portion of our Famous Footwear sales are dependent on our Famous Footwear loyalty program, Rewards, and any decrease in sales from Rewards could have a material adverse impact on our sales.Rewards is a customer loyalty program that drives sales and traffic for the Famous Footwear segment.  Rewards members earn points toward savings certificates for qualifying purchases.  Upon reaching specified point values, members are issued a savings certificate, which may be redeemed for purchases at Famous Footwear.  Approximately 75% of our fiscal 2017 sales within the Famous Footwear segment were generated by our Rewards members.  If our Rewards members do not continue to shop at Famous Footwear, our sales may be adversely affected.Our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by the failure of financial institutions to fulfill their commitments under our Credit Agreement.The First Amendment to our Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which matures on December 18, 2019, is provided by a syndicate of financial institutions, with each institution agreeing severally (and not jointly) to make revolving credit loans to us in an aggregate amount of up to $600.0 million in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.  In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for an increase at the Company's option by up to $150.0 million.  If one or more of the financial institutions participating in the Credit Agreement were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment, the portion of the facility provided by such defaulting financial institution might not be available to us.If we are unable to maintain our credit rating, our ability to access capital and interest rates may be negatively impacted.The credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings.  Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to us or our industry and could limit our access to long-term funding or cause such access to be available at a higher borrowing cost for our operations.  We are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive.  If our ability to access capital becomes constrained, our interest expense will likely increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  "
16,CAL,CALERES INC,2017-03-28,"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORSConsumer demand for our products may be adversely impacted by economic conditions and other factors.Worldwide economic conditions continue to be uncertain. Consumer confidence and spending are strongly influenced by general economic conditions and other factors, including fiscal policy, the changing tax and regulatory environment, interest rates, minimum wage rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, the liquidity of consumers’ assets, health care costs, currency exchange rates, taxation, energy costs, real estate values, foreclosure rates, unemployment trends, weather conditions, and the economic consequences of military action or terrorist activities. Negative economic conditions generally decrease disposable income and, consequently, consumer purchases of discretionary items like our products. Negative trends in economic conditions could also drive up the cost of our products, which may require us to increase our product prices. These increases in our product costs, and possibly prices, may not be offset by comparable increases in consumer disposable income. As a result, our customers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or purchase the lower-priced products of our competitors, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.10If we are unable to anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends and successfully apply new technology, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net sales and earnings.The footwear industry is subject to rapidly changing consumer shopping preferences and patterns and fashion trends.  Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change. Accordingly, the success of both our wholesale and retail operations depends largely on our ability to anticipate, understand and react to changing consumer demands and preferences, including the recent consumer shift to primarily online shopping. If we fail to successfully anticipate and respond to changes in consumer shopping patterns, demands and fashion trends, develop new products and designs, and implement effective, responsive merchandising and marketing strategies and programs, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories and lower gross margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We operate in a highly competitive industry.Competition is intense in the footwear industry. Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater financial, marketing and technological resources than we do; others are able to offer footwear on a lateral basis alongside their apparel products; and others have successfully branded their trademarks as lifestyle brands, resulting in greater competitive advantages. Low barriers to entry into this industry further intensify competition by allowing new companies to easily enter the markets in which we compete.  Some of our suppliers further compound these competitive pressures by allowing consumers to purchase their products directly through supplier-maintained Internet sites and retail stores. In addition, retailers aggressively compete on the basis of price, which puts competitive pressure on us to keep our prices low.We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the footwear industry depends on a number of factors, including style, price, performance, quality, location and service, as well as the strength of our brand names. We remain competitive by increasing awareness of our brands, improving the efficiency of our supply chain and enhancing the style, comfort, fashion and perceived value of our products. However, our competitors may implement more effective marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, make more attractive offers to potential employees, distribution partners and manufacturers, or respond more quickly to changes in consumer preferences than us. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand the development and marketing of our products, which could adversely impact our financial results.We rely primarily on foreign sources of production, which subjects our business to risks associated with international trade.We rely primarily on foreign sourcing for our footwear products through third-party manufacturing facilities located outside the United States. As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our third-party foreign manufacturers. Foreign sourcing is subject to numerous risks, including trade relations, work stoppages, transportation delays (including delays at foreign and domestic ports) and costs (including customs duties, quotas, tariffs, anti-dumping duties, safeguard measures, cargo restrictions or other trade restrictions), domestic and foreign political instability, foreign currency fluctuations, variable economic conditions, expropriation, nationalization, natural disasters, terrorist acts and military conflict and changes in governmental regulations (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act).  At the same time, potential changes in manufacturing preferences, including, but not limited to the following, pose additional risk and uncertainty:•Manufacturing capacity may shift from footwear to other industries with manufacturing margins that are perceived to be higher. •Some footwear manufacturers may face labor shortages as workers seek better wages and working conditions in other industries and locations.As a result of these risks, there can be no assurance that we will not experience reductions in available production capacity, increases in our manufacturing costs, late deliveries or terminations of our supplier relationships. Furthermore, these sourcing risks are compounded by the lack of diversification in the geographic location of our foreign sourcing and manufacturing. With the majority of our supply originating in China, a substantial portion of our supply could be at risk in the event of any significant negative development related to relations between United States and China.Although we believe we could find alternative manufacturing sources for the products that we currently source from third-party manufacturing facilities in China or other countries, we may not be able to locate alternative manufacturers on terms as favorable as our current terms, including pricing, payment terms, manufacturing capacity, quality standards and lead times for delivery. In addition, there is substantial competition in the footwear industry for quality footwear manufacturers. Accordingly, our future results will partly depend on our ability to maintain positive working relationships with, and offer competitive terms to, our foreign manufacturers. If supply issues cause us to be unable to provide products consistent with our standards or manufacture our footwear in a cost and time efficient manner, our customers may cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reductions in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.11Our operating results depend on preparing accurate sales forecasts and properly managing our inventory levels.Using sales forecasts, we place orders with manufacturers for some of our products prior to the time we receive all of our customers’ orders to minimize purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non-delivery. We also maintain an inventory of certain products that we anticipate will be in greater demand. At the retail level, we place orders for product many months in advance of our key selling seasons. Adverse economic conditions and rapidly changing consumer preferences can make it difficult for us and our retail customers to accurately forecast product trends in order to match production with demand. If we fail to accurately assess consumer fashion tastes and the impact of economic factors on consumer spending or to effectively differentiate our retail and wholesale offerings, our inventory levels may exceed customer demand, resulting in inventory write-downs, higher carrying costs, lower gross margins or the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could significantly impact our financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply the quality products that we require in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages may delay shipments to customers (and possibly require us to offer discounts or costly expedited shipping), negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships, adversely impact our sales results and diminish brand awareness and loyalty.We are reliant upon our information technology systems, and any major disruption of these systems could adversely impact our ability to effectively operate our business.Our computer network and systems are essential to all aspects of our operations, including design, pricing, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution. Our ability to manage and maintain our inventory and to deliver products in a timely manner depends on these systems. If any of these systems fails to operate as expected, we experience problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, a breach in security occurs or a natural disaster interrupts system functions, we may experience delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency in our operations or be required to expend significant capital to correct the problem, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.A cybersecurity breach may adversely affect our sales and reputation.We routinely possess sensitive consumer and associate information. We also provide certain customer and employee data to third parties for analysis, benefit distribution or compliance purposes. While we believe we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect that information, hackers and data thieves operate sophisticated, large-scale attacks that could breach our information systems, despite ongoing security measures. In addition, we are required to comply with increasingly complex regulations designed to protect our business and personal data. Any breach of our network security, a third-party’s network security or failure to comply with applicable regulations may result in (a) the loss of valuable business data and/or our consumers’ or associates’ personal information, (b) increased costs associated with implementing additional protections and processes, (c) a disruption of our business and a loss of sales, (d) negative media attention, (e) damage to our consumer and associate relationships and reputation, and (f) fines or lawsuits.Transitional challenges with acquisitions could result in unexpected expenditures of time and resources.Periodically, we pursue acquisitions of other companies or businesses, such as our 2016 acquisition of Allen Edmonds, as further discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Although we review the records of acquisition candidates, the review may not reveal all existing or potential problems. As a result, we may not accurately assess the value of the business and may, accordingly, ultimately assume unknown adverse operating conditions and/or unanticipated liabilities. Acquisitions may also cause the Company to incur debt, write-offs of goodwill if the business does not perform as well as expected and substantial amortization expenses associated with other intangible assets. We face the risk that the returns on acquisitions will not support the expenditures or indebtedness incurred to acquire or launch such businesses. We also face the risk that we will not be able to integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense, delay or other operational or financial problems. Integration may be hindered by, among other things, differing procedures, including internal controls, business practices and technology systems. We may need to allocate more management resources to integration than we planned, which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other profitable activities.Customer concentration and other trends in customer behavior may lead to a reduction in or loss of sales.Our wholesale customers include national chains, online retailers, department stores, mass merchandisers, independent retailers and catalogs. Several of our customers operate multiple department store divisions. Furthermore, we often sell multiple types of branded, licensed and private-label footwear to these same customers. While we believe purchasing decisions in many cases are made independently by the buyers and merchandisers of each of the customers, a decision by a significant customer to decrease the amount of footwear products purchased from us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.In addition, with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, including store count reductions at major retail chains, we and our wholesale customers increasingly depend upon a reduced number of key retailers whose bargaining strength is growing. This consolidation may result in the following adverse consequences:12•Our wholesale customers may seek more favorable terms for their purchases of our products, which could limit our ability to raise prices, recoup cost increases or achieve our profit goals. •The number of stores that carry our products could decline, thereby exposing us to a greater concentration of accounts receivable risk and negatively impacting our brand visibility.We also face the following risks with respect to our customers:•Our customers could develop in-house brands or use a higher mix of private-label footwear products, which would negatively impact our sales.•As we sell our products to customers and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer’s financial condition, the financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to stop doing business with that customer, reduce our business with that customer or be unable to collect from that customer.•Since we transact primarily in United States dollars, our international customers could purchase from competitors who will transact business in their local currency.  •If any of our major wholesale customers experiences a significant downturn in its business or fails to remain committed to our products or brands, then these customers may reduce or discontinue purchases from us.•Retailers are directly sourcing more of their products directly from foreign manufacturers and reducing their reliance on wholesalers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.A disruption in the effective functioning of our distribution centers could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis.We currently use several distribution centers, which are leased or third-party managed.  These distribution centers serve as the source of replenishment of inventory for our footwear stores and e-commerce websites operated by our Famous Footwear and Brand Portfolio segments and serve the wholesale operations of our Brand Portfolio segment. We may be unable to successfully manage, negotiate or renew our third-party distribution center agreements, or we may experience complications with respect to our distribution centers, such as substantial damage to, or destruction of, such facilities due to natural disasters or ineffective information technology systems. In such an event, our other distribution centers may not be able to support the resulting additional distribution demands and we may be unable to locate alternative persons or entities capable of fulfilling our distribution needs, resulting in an adverse effect on our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis.Our success depends on our ability to retain senior management and recruit and retain other key associates.Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified management, administrative, product development and sales personnel to support existing operations and future growth. In addition, our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses often depends on our ability to retain incumbent personnel, many of whom possess valuable institutional knowledge and operating experience. Competition for qualified personnel in the footwear industry is intense and we compete for these individuals with other companies that in many cases have superior financial and other resources. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management or key associates, the inability to attract and retain other qualified personnel or the inability to effectively transition positions could adversely affect the sales, design and production of our products as well as the implementation of our strategic initiatives.Foreign currency fluctuations may result in higher costs and decreased gross profits.Although we purchase most of our products from foreign manufacturers in United States dollars and otherwise engage in foreign currency hedging transactions, we cannot ensure that we will not experience cost variations with respect to exchange rate changes.  Currency exchange rate fluctuations may also adversely impact third parties who manufacture the Company’s products by making their purchases of raw materials or other production costs more expensive and more difficult to finance, resulting in higher prices and lower margins for the Company, its distributors and licensees.Our business, sales and brand value could be harmed by violations of labor, trade or other laws.We focus on doing business with those suppliers who share our commitment to responsible business practices and the principles set forth in our Production Code of Conduct (the “PCOC”). By requiring our suppliers to comply with the PCOC, we encourage our suppliers to promote best practices and work toward continual improvement throughout their production operations. The PCOC sets forth standards for working conditions and other matters, including compliance with applicable labor practices, workplace environment and compliance with laws. Although we promote ethical business practices, we do not control our suppliers or their labor practices. A failure by any of our suppliers to adhere to these standards or laws could cause us to incur additional costs for our products, could cause negative publicity and harm our business and reputation. We also require our suppliers to meet our standards for product safety, including compliance with applicable laws and standards with respect to safety issues, including lead content in paint. Failure by any of our suppliers to adhere to product safety standards could lead to a product recall, which may result in critical media coverage, harm our business and reputation, and cause us to incur additional costs.13In addition, if we, or our suppliers or foreign manufacturers, violate United States or foreign trade laws or regulations, we may be subject to additional duties, significant monetary penalties, the seizure and forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import or the loss of our import privileges. Possible violations of United States or foreign laws or regulations could include inadequate record keeping of our imported products, misstatements or errors as to the origin, classification, marketing or valuation of our imported products, fraudulent visas or labor violations. The effects of these factors could render our conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical and have a negative impact on our operating results.Our retail business depends on our ability to secure affordable and desirable leased locations without creating a competitive concentration of stores.The success of the retail business within our Famous Footwear and Brand Portfolio segments depends, in part, on our ability to secure affordable, long-term leases in desirable locations for our leased retail footwear stores and to secure renewals of such leases. As consumer shopping preferences have evolved, we continue to focus on opening stores in locations with a greater penetration of high-value consumers. No assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully negotiate lease renewals for existing stores or obtain acceptable terms for new stores in desirable locations. In addition, opening new stores in our existing markets may result in reduced net sales in existing stores as our stores become more concentrated in the markets we serve. As a result, the number of consumers and financial performance of individual stores may decline and the average sales per square foot at our stores may be reduced.If we are unable to maintain working relationships with our major branded suppliers, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted.Our Famous Footwear segment purchases a substantial portion of its footwear products from major branded suppliers.  Purchases from two major branded suppliers, Nike, Inc. and Skechers USA, Inc., collectively comprise approximately 25% and 12%, respectively, of sales for the Famous Footwear segment.  As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our suppliers. In addition, the success of our financial performance is dependent on the ability of our Famous Footwear segment to obtain products from our suppliers on a timely basis and on acceptable terms. While we believe our relationships with our current suppliers are good, the loss of any of our major suppliers or product developed exclusively for our Famous Footwear stores could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, negative trends in global economic conditions may adversely impact our suppliers. If these third parties do not perform their obligations or are unable to provide us with the materials and services we need at prices and terms that are acceptable to us, our ability to meet our consumers’ demand could be adversely affected.Our reputation and competitive position are dependent on our ability to license well-recognized brands, license our own brands under successful licensing arrangements and protect our intellectual property rights.Licenses - Company as LicenseeAlthough we own most of our wholesale brands, we also rely on our ability to attract, retain and maintain good relationships with licensors that have strong, well-recognized brands and trademarks. Our license agreements are generally for an initial term of two to four years, subject to renewal, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these licenses. Even our longer-term or renewable licenses are typically dependent upon our ability to market and sell the licensed products at specified levels, and the failure to meet such levels may result in the termination or non-renewal of such licenses. Furthermore, many of our license agreements require minimum royalty payments, and if we are unable to generate sufficient sales and profitability to cover these minimum royalty requirements, we may be required to make additional payments to the licensors that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, because certain of our license agreements are non-exclusive, new or existing competitors may obtain licenses with overlapping product or geographic terms, resulting in increased competition for a particular market.Licenses - Company as LicensorWe have entered into numerous license agreements with respect to the brands and trademarks that we own. While we have significant control over our licensees’ products and advertising, we generally cannot control their operational and financial issues. If our licensees are not able to meet annual sales and royalty goals, obtain financing, manage their supply chain, control quality and maintain positive relationships with their customers, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. While we would likely have the ability to terminate an underperforming license, it may be difficult and costly to locate an acceptable substitute distributor or licensee, and we may experience a disruption in our sales and brand visibility. In addition, although many of our license agreements prohibit the licensees from entering into licensing arrangements with certain of our competitors, they are generally not prohibited from offering, under other brands, the types of products covered by their license agreements with us.TrademarksWe believe that our trademarks and trade names are important to our success and competitive position because our distinctive marks create a market for our products and distinguish our products from other products. We cannot, however, guarantee that we will be able to secure 14protection for our intellectual property in the future or that such protection will be adequate for future operations. Furthermore, we face the risk of ineffective protection of intellectual property rights in jurisdictions where we source and distribute our products, some of which do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States. If we are unsuccessful in challenging a party’s products on the basis of infringement of our intellectual property rights, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales, devalue our brands and result in a shift in consumer preference away from our products. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition could be adversely affected.Changes in tax laws, policies and treaties could result in higher taxes, lower profitability, and increased volatility in our financial results.Our financial results are significantly impacted by our effective tax rates, for both domestic and international operations. Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by factors such as changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in permitted deductions, changes in tax laws, interpretations, policies and treaties, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions and any repatriation of earnings from our international operations. The occurrence of such events may result in higher taxes, lower profitability and increased volatility in our financial results.  In addition, President Trump and his administration have indicated that corporate tax reform is a high priority, which may impact us in a variety of ways, including corporate tax rates, the deductibility of certain expenses and potential taxation of foreign earnings (including the taxation of previously unrepatriated foreign earnings). Although we cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed legislation may pass, if enacted, such legislation could have a material adverse impact on our earnings or cash flow.Our quarterly sales and earnings may fluctuate, which may result in volatility in, or a decline in, our stock price.Our quarterly sales and earnings can vary due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:•Our Famous Footwear retail business is seasonally weighted to the back-to-school season, which falls in our third fiscal quarter. As a result, the success of our back-to-school offering, which is affected by our ability to anticipate consumer demand and fashion trends, could have a disproportionate impact on our full year results. •In our wholesale business, sales of footwear are dependent on orders from our major customers, and they may change delivery schedules, change the mix of products they order or cancel orders without penalty. •Our wholesale customers set the delivery schedule for shipments of our products, which could cause shifts of sales between quarters. •Our estimated annual tax rate is based on projections of our domestic and international operating results for the year, which we review and revise as necessary each quarter.•Our earnings are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, changes in product sales mix, geographic sales trends, weather conditions, consumer sentiment and currency exchange rate fluctuations. As a result of these specific and other general factors, our operating results will vary from quarter to quarter and the results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year. Any shortfall in sales or earnings from the levels expected by investors could cause a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.We are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in the unexpected expenditure of time and resources.We are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions (including environmental matters) relating to our business and to our past operations. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are expensive and will require that we devote substantial resources and executive time to defend, thereby diverting management’s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for further discussion of pending matters.A significant portion of our Famous Footwear sales are dependent on our Famous Footwear loyalty program, Rewards, and any decrease in sales from Rewards could have a material adverse impact on our sales.Rewards is a customer loyalty program that drives sales and traffic for the Famous Footwear segment.  Rewards members earn points toward savings certificates for qualifying purchases. Upon reaching specified point values, members are issued a savings certificate, which they may redeem for purchases at Famous Footwear.  Approximately 75% of our fiscal 2016 sales within the Famous Footwear segment were generated by our Rewards members.  If our Rewards members do not continue to shop at Famous Footwear, our sales may be adversely affected.15Our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by the failure of financial institutions to fulfill their commitments under our Credit Agreement.The First Amendment to our Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which matures on December 18, 2019, is provided by a syndicate of financial institutions, with each institution agreeing severally (and not jointly) to make revolving credit loans to us in an aggregate amount of up to $600.0 million in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for an increase at the Company's option by up to $150.0 million.  If one or more of the financial institutions participating in the Credit Agreement were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment, the portion of the facility provided by such defaulting financial institution might not be available to us.If we are unable to maintain our credit rating, our ability to access capital and interest rates may be negatively impacted.The credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to us or our industry and could limit our access to long-term funding or cause such access to be available at a higher borrowing cost for our operations. We are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. If our ability to access capital becomes constrained, our interest expense will likely increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Changes to Federal overtime regulations could increase our payroll costs.In May 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor (""DOL"") released updated overtime and exemption rules under the Fair Labor Standards Act which increase the minimum salary needed to qualify for the standard white collar employee exemption and the threshold to qualify for a highly compensated employee (""HCE""). Additionally, the updated rules establish a mechanism for automatically increasing the minimum salary and compensation levels every three years. Changes to the overtime and exemption rules may increase the Company's payroll costs and the risk of litigation. The rules had an effective date of December 1, 2016. However, on November 22, 2016, a federal district court temporarily enjoined enforcement of the rules. The final outcome of these proceedings and potential impact to the Company is uncertain.  "
15,CAL,CALERES INC,2016-03-29,"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORSConsumer demand for our products may be adversely impacted by economic conditions and other factors.Worldwide economic conditions continue to be uncertain. Consumer confidence and spending are strongly influenced by general economic conditions and other factors, including fiscal policy, changing tax and regulatory environment, interest rates, minimum wage rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, the liquidity of consumers’ assets, health care costs, currency exchange rates, taxation, energy costs, real estate values, foreclosure rates, unemployment trends, weather conditions, and the economic consequences of military action or terrorist activities. Negative economic conditions generally decrease disposable income and, consequently, consumer purchases of discretionary items like our products. Negative trends in economic conditions could also drive up the cost of our products, which may require us to increase our product prices. These increases in our product costs, and possibly prices, may not be offset by comparable increases in consumer disposable income. As a result, our customers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or purchase the lower-priced products of our competitors, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.10If we are unable to anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends and successfully apply new technology, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net sales and earnings.The footwear industry is subject to rapidly changing consumer demands and fashion trends.  Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change. Accordingly, the success of both our wholesale and retail operations, including the expansion of our e-commerce business, depends largely on our ability to anticipate, understand and react to changing consumer demands and preferences. If we fail to successfully anticipate and respond to changes in consumer demand and fashion trends, develop new products and designs, and implement effective, responsive merchandising and marketing strategies and programs, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories and lower gross margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We operate in a highly competitive industry.Competition is intense in the footwear industry. Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater financial, marketing and technological resources than we do; others are able to offer footwear on a lateral basis alongside their apparel products; and others have successfully branded their trademarks as lifestyle brands, resulting in greater competitive advantages. Low barriers to entry into this industry further intensify competition by allowing new companies to easily enter the markets in which we compete.  Some of our suppliers further compound these competitive pressures by allowing consumers to purchase their products directly through supplier-maintained Internet sites and retail stores. In addition, retailers aggressively compete on the basis of price, which puts competitive pressure on us to keep our prices low.We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the footwear industry depends on a number of factors, including style, price, performance, quality, location and service, as well as the strength of our brand names. We remain competitive by increasing awareness of our brands, improving the efficiency of our supply chain and enhancing the style, comfort, fashion and perceived value of our products. However, our competitors may implement more effective marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, make more attractive offers to potential employees, distribution partners and manufacturers, or respond more quickly to changes in consumer preferences than us. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand the development and marketing of our products, which could adversely impact our financial results.We rely on foreign sources of production, which subjects our business to risks associated with international trade.We rely on foreign sourcing for our footwear products through third-party manufacturing facilities located outside the United States. As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our third-party foreign manufacturers. Foreign sourcing is subject to numerous risks, including trade relations, work stoppages, transportation delays (including delays at foreign and domestic ports) and costs (including customs duties, quotas, tariffs, anti-dumping duties, safeguard measures, cargo restrictions or other trade restrictions), political instability, foreign currency fluctuations, variable economic conditions, expropriation, nationalization, natural disasters, terrorist acts and military conflict and changes in governmental regulations (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act).  At the same time, potential changes in manufacturing preferences, including, but not limited to the following, pose additional risk and uncertainty:•Manufacturing capacity may shift from footwear to other industries with manufacturing margins that are perceived to be higher. •Some footwear manufacturers may face labor shortages as workers seek better wages and working conditions in other industries and locations.As a result of these risks, there can be no assurance that we will not experience reductions in available production capacity, increases in our manufacturing costs, late deliveries or terminations of our supplier relationships. Furthermore, these sourcing risks are compounded by the lack of diversification in the geographic location of our foreign sourcing and manufacturing. With the majority of our supply originating in China, a substantial portion of our supply could be at risk in the event of any significant negative development related to China.Although we believe we could find alternative manufacturing sources for the products that we currently source from third-party manufacturing facilities in China or other countries, we may not be able to locate alternative manufacturers on terms as favorable as our current terms, including pricing, payment terms, manufacturing capacity, quality standards and lead times for delivery. In addition, there is substantial competition in the footwear industry for quality footwear manufacturers. Accordingly, our future results will partly depend on our ability to maintain positive working relationships with, and offer competitive terms to, our foreign manufacturers. If supply issues cause us to be unable to provide products consistent with our standards or manufacture our footwear in a cost and time efficient manner, our customers may cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reductions in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Our operating results depend on preparing accurate sales forecasts and properly managing our inventory levels.Using sales forecasts, we place orders with manufacturers for some of our products prior to the time we receive all of our customers’ orders to minimize purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non-delivery. We also maintain an inventory of 11certain products that we anticipate will be in greater demand. At the retail level, we place orders for product many months in advance of our key selling seasons. Adverse economic conditions and rapidly changing consumer preferences can make it difficult for us and our retail customers to accurately forecast product trends in order to match production with demand. If we fail to accurately assess consumer fashion tastes and the impact of economic factors on consumer spending or to effectively differentiate our retail and wholesale offerings, our inventory levels may exceed customer demand, resulting in inventory write-downs, higher carrying costs, lower gross margins or the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could significantly impact our financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply the quality products that we require in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages may delay shipments to customers (and possibly require us to offer discounts or costly expedited shipping), negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships, adversely impact our sales results and diminish brand awareness and loyalty.A cybersecurity breach may adversely affect our sales and reputation.We routinely possess sensitive consumer and associate information. We also provide certain customer and employee data to third parties for analysis, benefit distribution or compliance purposes. While we believe we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect that information, hackers and data thieves operate sophisticated, large-scale attacks that could breach our information systems, despite ongoing security measures. In addition, we are required to comply with increasingly complex regulations designed to protect our business and personal data. Any breach of our network security, a third-party’s network security or failure to comply with applicable regulations may result in (a) the loss of valuable business data and/or our consumers’ or associates’ personal information, (b) increased costs associated with implementing additional protections and processes, (c) a disruption of our business and a loss of sales, (d) negative media attention, (e) damage to our consumer and associate relationships and reputation, and (f) fines or lawsuits.We are reliant upon our information technology systems, and any major disruption of these systems could adversely impact our ability to effectively operate our business.Our computer network and systems are essential to all aspects of our operations, including design, pricing, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution. Our ability to manage and maintain our inventory and to deliver products in a timely manner depends on these systems. If any of these systems fails to operate as expected, we experience problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, a breach in security occurs or a natural disaster interrupts system functions, we may experience delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency in our operations or be required to expend significant capital to correct the problem, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Customer concentration and other trends in customer behavior may lead to a reduction in or loss of sales.Our wholesale customers include national chains, department stores, online retailers, mass merchandisers, independent retailers and catalogs. Several of our customers operate multiple department store divisions. Furthermore, we often sell multiple types of branded, licensed and private-label footwear to these same customers. While we believe purchasing decisions in many cases are made independently by the buyers and merchandisers of each of the customers, a decision by a significant customer to decrease the amount of footwear products purchased from us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.In addition, with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, we and our wholesale customers increasingly depend upon a reduced number of key retailers whose bargaining strength is growing. This consolidation may result in the following adverse consequences:•Our wholesale customers may seek more favorable terms for their purchases of our products, which could limit our ability to raise prices, recoup cost increases or achieve our profit goals. •The number of stores that carry our products could decline, thereby exposing us to a greater concentration of accounts receivable risk and negatively impacting our brand visibility.We also face the following risks with respect to our customers:•Our customers could develop in-house brands or use a higher mix of private-label footwear products, which would negatively impact our sales.•As we sell our products to customers and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer’s financial condition, the financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to stop doing business with that customer, reduce our business with that customer or be unable to collect from that customer.•Since we transact primarily in United States dollars, our international customers could purchase from competitors who will transact business in their local currency.  •If any of our major wholesale customers experiences a significant downturn in its business or fails to remain committed to our products or brands, then these customers may reduce or discontinue purchases from us.12•Retailers are directly sourcing more of their products directly from foreign manufacturers and reducing their reliance on wholesalers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.A disruption in the effective functioning of our distribution centers could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis.We currently use several distribution centers, which are leased or third-party managed.  These distribution centers serve as the source of replenishment of inventory for our footwear stores and e-commerce websites operated by our Famous Footwear and Brand Portfolio segments and serve the wholesale operations of our Brand Portfolio segment. We may be unable to successfully manage, negotiate or renew our third-party distribution center agreements, or we may experience complications with respect to our distribution centers, such as substantial damage to, or destruction of, such facilities due to natural disasters or ineffective information technology systems. In such an event, our other distribution centers may not be able to support the resulting additional distribution demands and we may be unable to locate alternative persons or entities capable of fulfilling our distribution needs, resulting in an adverse effect on our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis.Our success depends on our ability to retain senior management and recruit and retain other key associates.Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified management, administrative, product development and sales personnel to support existing operations and future growth. In addition, our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses often depends on our ability to retain incumbent personnel, many of whom possess valuable institutional knowledge and operating experience. Competition for qualified personnel in the footwear industry is intense and we compete for these individuals with other companies that in many cases have superior financial and other resources. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management or key associates, the inability to attract and retain other qualified personnel or the inability to effectively transition positions could adversely affect the sales, design and production of our products as well as the implementation of our strategic initiatives.Foreign currency fluctuations may result in higher costs and decreased gross profits.Although we purchase most of our products from foreign manufacturers in United States dollars and otherwise engage in foreign currency hedging transactions, we cannot ensure that we will not experience cost variations with respect to exchange rate changes.  Currency exchange rate fluctuations may also adversely impact third parties who manufacture the Company’s products by making their purchases of raw materials or other production costs more expensive and more difficult to finance, resulting in higher prices and lower margins for the Company, its distributors and licensees.Our business, sales and brand value could be harmed by violations of labor, trade or other laws.We focus on doing business with those suppliers who share our commitment to responsible business practices and the principles set forth in our Production Code of Conduct (the “PCOC”). By requiring our suppliers to comply with the PCOC, we encourage our suppliers to promote best practices and work toward continual improvement throughout their production operations. The PCOC sets forth standards for working conditions and other matters, including compliance with applicable labor practices, workplace environment and compliance with laws. Although we promote ethical business practices, we do not control our suppliers or their labor practices. A failure by any of our suppliers to adhere to these standards or laws could cause us to incur additional costs for our products, could cause negative publicity and harm our business and reputation. We also require our suppliers to meet our standards for product safety, including compliance with applicable laws and standards with respect to safety issues, including lead content in paint. Failure by any of our suppliers to adhere to product safety standards could lead to a product recall, which may result in critical media coverage, harm our business and reputation, and cause us to incur additional costs.In addition, if we, or our suppliers or foreign manufacturers, violate United States or foreign trade laws or regulations, we may be subject to additional duties, significant monetary penalties, the seizure and forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import or the loss of our import privileges. Possible violations of United States or foreign laws or regulations could include inadequate record keeping of our imported products, misstatements or errors as to the origin, classification, marketing or valuation of our imported products, fraudulent visas or labor violations. The effects of these factors could render our conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical and have a negative impact on our operating results.Our retail business depends on our ability to secure affordable and desirable leased locations without creating a competitive concentration of stores.The success of the retail business within our Famous Footwear and Brand Portfolio segments depends, in part, on our ability to secure affordable, long-term leases in desirable locations for our leased retail footwear stores and to secure renewals of such leases. No assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully negotiate lease renewals for existing stores or obtain acceptable terms for new stores in desirable locations. In addition, opening new Famous Footwear stores in our existing markets may result in reduced net sales in existing 13stores as our stores become more concentrated in the markets we serve. As a result, the number of consumers and financial performance of individual stores may decline and the average sales per square foot at our stores may be reduced.If we are unable to maintain working relationships with our major branded suppliers, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted.Our Famous Footwear segment purchases a substantial portion of its footwear products from major branded suppliers.  Purchases from two major branded suppliers, Nike, Inc. and Skechers USA, Inc., collectively comprise approximately 23% and 13%, respectively, of sales for the Famous Footwear segment.  As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our suppliers. In addition, the success of our financial performance is dependent on the ability of our Famous Footwear segment to obtain products from our suppliers on a timely basis and on acceptable terms. While we believe our relationships with our current suppliers are good, the loss of any of our major suppliers or product developed exclusively for our Famous Footwear stores could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, negative trends in global economic conditions may adversely impact our suppliers. If these third parties do not perform their obligations or are unable to provide us with the materials and services we need at prices and terms that are acceptable to us, our ability to meet our consumers’ demand could be adversely affected.Our reputation and competitive position are dependent on our ability to license well-recognized brands, license our own brands under successful licensing arrangements and protect our intellectual property rights.Licenses - Company as LicenseeAlthough we own most of our wholesale brands, we also rely on our ability to attract, retain and maintain good relationships with licensors that have strong, well-recognized brands and trademarks.

Even our longer-term or renewable licenses are typically dependent upon our ability to market and sell the licensed products at specified levels, and the failure to meet such levels may result in the termination or non-renewal of such licenses. Furthermore, many of our license agreements require minimum royalty payments, and if we are unable to generate sufficient sales and profitability to cover these minimum royalty requirements, we may be required to make additional payments to the licensors that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, because certain of our license agreements are non-exclusive, new or existing competitors may obtain licenses with overlapping product or geographic terms, resulting in increased competition for a particular market.Licenses - Company as LicensorWe have entered into numerous license agreements with respect to the brands and trademarks that we own.

While we would likely have the ability to terminate an underperforming license, it may be difficult and costly to locate an acceptable substitute distributor or licensee, and we may experience a disruption in our sales and brand visibility. In addition, although many of our license agreements prohibit the licensees from entering into licensing arrangements with certain of our competitors, they are generally not prohibited from offering, under other brands, the types of products covered by their license agreements with us.TrademarksWe believe that our trademarks and trade names are important to our success and competitive position because our distinctive marks create a market for our products and distinguish our products from other products.

Furthermore, we face the risk of ineffective protection of intellectual property rights in jurisdictions where we source and distribute our products, some of which do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States. If we are unsuccessful in challenging a party’s products on the basis of infringement of our intellectual property rights, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales, devalue our brands and result in a shift in consumer preference away from our products. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition could be adversely affected.Changes in tax laws, policies and treaties could result in higher taxes, lower profitability, and increased volatility in our financial results.Our financial results are significantly impacted by our effective tax rates, for both domestic and international operations. Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by factors such as changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in permitted deductions, changes in tax laws, interpretations, policies and treaties, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions and any repatriation of earnings from our international operations. The occurrence of such events may result in higher taxes, lower profitability and increased volatility in our financial results.14Our quarterly sales and earnings may fluctuate, which may result in volatility in, or a decline in, our stock price.Our quarterly sales and earnings can vary due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:•Our Famous Footwear retail business is seasonally weighted to the back-to-school season, which falls in our third fiscal quarter. As a result, the success of our back-to-school offering, which is affected by our ability to anticipate consumer demand and fashion trends, could have a disproportionate impact on our full year results. •In our wholesale business, sales of footwear are dependent on orders from our major customers, and they may change delivery schedules, change the mix of products they order or cancel orders without penalty. •Our wholesale customers set the delivery schedule for shipments of our products, which could cause shifts of sales between quarters. •Our estimated annual tax rate is based on projections of our domestic and international operating results for the year, which we review and revise as necessary each quarter.•Our earnings are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, changes in product sales mix, geographic sales trends, weather conditions, consumer sentiment and currency exchange rate fluctuations. As a result of these specific and other general factors, our operating results will vary from quarter to quarter and the results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year. Any shortfall in sales or earnings from the levels expected by investors could cause a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.Transitional challenges with business acquisitions or divestitures could result in the inability to achieve our strategic and operating goals.Periodically, we pursue acquisitions of other companies or businesses and divestitures of businesses. In either case, we may not achieve our strategic and operating goals through such activity.  For example, although we complete due diligence on acquisition candidates, the due diligence may not reveal all existing or potential problems. As a result, we may not accurately assess the value of the business and may, accordingly, ultimately assume unknown adverse operating conditions and/or unanticipated liabilities. In addition, the acquired business may not perform as well as expected. We face the risk that the returns on acquisitions will not support the expenditures or indebtedness incurred to acquire or launch such businesses. We also face the risk that we will not be able to integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively. Integration of new businesses may be hindered by, among other things, differing procedures, including internal controls, business practices and technology systems. We may need to allocate more management resources to integration than we planned, which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other profitable activities. In addition, divesting a business may impede progress toward strategic and operating goals.  In connection with a divestiture, we may not successfully divest a business without substantial interruption, expense, delay or other operational or financial problems, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in the unexpected expenditure of time and resources.We are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions (including environmental matters) relating to our business and to our past operations. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are expensive and will require that we devote substantial resources and executive time to defend, thereby diverting management’s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.

Rewards members earn points toward savings certificates for qualifying purchases. Upon reaching specified point values, members are issued a savings certificate, which they may redeem for purchases at Famous Footwear.  Approximately 74% of our fiscal 2015 sales within the Famous Footwear segment were generated by our Rewards members.

3,CAL,CALERES INC,2015-04-01,"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORSConsumer demand for our products may be adversely impacted by economic conditions and other factors.Worldwide economic conditions continue to be uncertain. Consumer confidence and spending are strongly influenced by general economic conditions and other factors, including fiscal policy, changing tax and regulatory environment, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, the liquidity of consumers’ assets, health care costs, currency exchange rates, taxation, energy costs, real estate values, foreclosure rates, unemployment trends, weather conditions, and the economic consequences of military action or terrorist activities.

If we fail to successfully anticipate and respond to changes in consumer demand and fashion trends, develop new products and designs, and implement effective, responsive merchandising and marketing strategies and programs, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories and lower gross margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We operate in a highly competitive industry.10Competition is intense in the footwear industry. Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater financial, marketing and technological resources than we do; others are able to offer footwear on a lateral basis alongside their apparel products; and others have successfully branded their trademarks as lifestyle brands, resulting in greater competitive advantages. Low barriers to entry into this industry further intensify competition by allowing new companies to easily enter the markets in which we compete.  Some of our suppliers further compound these competitive pressures by allowing consumers to purchase their products directly through supplier-maintained Internet sites and retail stores. In addition, retailers aggressively compete on the basis of price, which puts competitive pressure on us to keep our wholesale prices low.We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the footwear industry depends on a number of factors, including style, price, performance, quality, location and service, as well as the strength of our brand names. We remain competitive by increasing awareness of our brands, improving the efficiency of our supply chain and enhancing the style, comfort, fashion and perceived value of our products. However, our competitors may implement more effective marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, make more attractive offers to potential employees, distribution partners and manufacturers, or respond more quickly to changes in consumer preferences than us. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand the development and marketing of our products, which could adversely impact our financial results.We rely on foreign sources of production, which subjects our business to risks associated with international trade.We rely on foreign sourcing for our footwear products through third-party manufacturing facilities primarily located in China. As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our third-party foreign manufacturers. Foreign sourcing is subject to numerous risks, including trade relations, work stoppages, disease outbreaks, transportation delays (including delays at foreign and domestic ports) and costs (including customs duties, quotas, tariffs, anti-dumping duties, safeguard measures, cargo restrictions or other trade restrictions), political instability, foreign currency fluctuations, variable economic conditions, expropriation, nationalization, natural disasters, terrorist acts and military conflict and changes in governmental regulations (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and climate change legislation).  At the same time, potential changes in Chinese manufacturing preferences, including, but not limited to the following, pose additional risk and uncertainty:•Manufacturing capacity in China may shift from footwear to other industries with manufacturing margins that are perceived to be higher. •Growth in domestic footwear consumption in China could lead to a significant decrease in factory space available for the manufacture of footwear to be exported.•Some footwear manufacturers in China continue to face labor shortages as migrant workers seek better wages and working conditions in other industries and locations.As a result of these risks, there can be no assurance that we will not experience reductions in the available production capacity, increases in our manufacturing costs, late deliveries or terminations of our supplier relationships. Furthermore these risks are compounded by the lack of diversification in the geographic location of our foreign sourcing and manufacturing. With almost all of our supply originating in China, a substantial portion of our supply could be at risk in the event of any significant negative development related to China.Although we believe we could find alternative manufacturing sources for the products that we currently source from China through other third-party manufacturing facilities in China or other countries, we may not be able to locate alternative manufacturers on terms as favorable as our current terms, including pricing, payment terms, manufacturing capacity, quality standards and lead times for delivery. In addition, there is substantial competition in the footwear industry for quality footwear manufacturers. Accordingly, our future results will partly depend on our ability to maintain positive working relationships with, and offer competitive terms to, our foreign manufacturers. If supply issues cause us to be unable to provide products consistent with our standards or manufacture our footwear in a cost and time efficient manner, our customers may cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reductions in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Our operating results depend on preparing accurate sales forecasts and properly managing our inventory levels.Using sales forecasts, we place orders with manufacturers for some of our products prior to the time we receive all of our customers’ orders to minimize purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non-delivery. We also maintain an inventory of certain products that we anticipate will be in greater demand. At the retail level, we place orders for product many months in advance of our key selling seasons. Adverse economic conditions and rapidly changing consumer preferences can make it difficult for us and our retail customers to accurately forecast product trends in order to match production with demand. If we fail to accurately assess consumer fashion tastes and the impact of economic factors on consumer spending or to effectively differentiate our retail and wholesale offerings, our inventory levels may exceed customer demand, resulting in inventory write-downs, higher carrying costs, lower gross margins or the sale 11of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could significantly impair our financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply the quality products that we require in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages may delay shipments to customers (and possibly require us to offer discounts or costly expedited shipping), negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships, adversely impact our sales results and diminish brand awareness and loyalty.A cybersecurity breach may adversely affect our sales and reputation.We routinely possess sensitive consumer and associate information. We also provide certain customer and employee data to third parties for analysis, benefit distribution or compliance purposes. While we believe we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect that information, hackers and data thieves operate sophisticated, large scale attacks that could breach our information systems, despite ongoing security measures. In addition, we are required to comply with increasingly complex regulations designed to protect our business and personal data. Any breach of our network security, a third-party’s network security or failure to comply with applicable regulations may result in (a) the loss of valuable business data and/or our consumers’ or associates’ personal information, (b) increased costs associated with implementing additional protections and processes, (c) a disruption of our business and a loss of sales, (d) negative media attention, (e) damage to our consumer and associate relationships and reputation, and (f) fines or lawsuits.We are reliant upon our information technology systems, and any major disruption of these systems could adversely impact our ability to effectively operate our business.Our computer network and systems are essential to all aspects of our operations, including design, pricing, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution. Our ability to manage and maintain our inventory and to deliver products in a timely manner depends on these systems. If any of these systems fails to operate as expected, we experience problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, a breach in security occurs or a natural disaster interrupts system functions, we may experience delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency in our operations or be required to expend significant capital to correct the problem, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Customer concentration and other trends in customer behavior may lead to a reduction in or loss of sales.Our wholesale customers include national chains, department stores, mass merchandisers, independent retailers, e-commerce retailers and catalogs. Several of our customers operate multiple department store divisions. Furthermore, we often sell multiple types of branded, licensed and private-label footwear to these same customers. While we believe purchasing decisions in many cases are made independently by the buyers and merchandisers of each of the customers, a decision by a significant customer to decrease the amount of footwear products purchased from us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.In addition, with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, we and our wholesale customers increasingly depend upon a reduced number of key retailers whose bargaining strength is growing. This consolidation may result in the following adverse consequences:•Our wholesale customers may seek more favorable terms for their purchases of our products, which could limit our ability to raise prices, recoup cost increases or achieve our profit goals. •The number of stores that carry our products could decline, thereby exposing us to a greater concentration of accounts receivable risk and negatively impacting our brand visibility.We also face the following risks with respect to our customers:•Our customers could develop in-house brands or utilize a higher mix of private-label footwear products, which would negatively impact our sales.•As we sell our products to customers and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer’s financial condition, the financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to stop doing business with that customer, reduce our business with that customer or be unable to collect from that customer.•If any of our major wholesale customers experiences a significant downturn in its business or fails to remain committed to our products or brands, then these customers may reduce or discontinue purchases from us.•Retailers are directly sourcing more of their products directly from manufacturers overseas and reducing their reliance on wholesalers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.A disruption in the effective functioning of our distribution centers could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis.We currently use several distribution centers, which are leased or third-party managed. These distribution centers serve as the source of replenishment of inventory for our footwear stores operated by our Famous Footwear and Brand Portfolio segments and serve the wholesale 12operations of our Brand Portfolio segment. We may be unable to successfully manage, negotiate or renew our third-party distribution center agreements, or we may experience complications with respect to our distribution centers, such as substantial damage to, or destruction of, such facilities due to natural disasters or ineffective information technology systems. In such an event, our other distribution centers may not be able to support the resulting additional distribution demands and we may be unable to locate alternative persons or entities capable of fulfilling our distribution needs, resulting in an adverse effect on our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis.Our success depends on our ability to retain senior management and recruit and retain other key associates.Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified management, administrative, product development and sales personnel to support existing operations and future growth. In addition, our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses often depends on our ability to retain incumbent personnel, many of whom possess valuable institutional knowledge and operating experience. Competition for qualified personnel in the footwear industry is intense and we compete for these individuals with other companies that in many cases have superior financial and other resources. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management, the inability to attract and retain other qualified personnel or the inability to effectively transition senior management positions could adversely affect the sales, design and production of our products as well as the implementation of our strategic initiatives.Foreign currency fluctuations may result in higher costs and decreased gross profits.Although we purchase most of our products from foreign manufacturers in United States dollars and otherwise engage in foreign currency hedging transactions, we cannot ensure that we will not experience cost variations with respect to exchange rate changes. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may also adversely impact third parties who manufacture the Company’s products by making their purchases of raw materials or other production costs more expensive and more difficult to finance, resulting in higher prices and lower margins for the Company, its distributors and licensees.Our business, sales and brand value could be harmed by violations of labor, trade or other laws.We focus on doing business with those suppliers who share our commitment to responsible business practices and the principles set forth in our Production Code of Conduct (the “PCOC”). By requiring our suppliers to comply with the PCOC, we encourage our suppliers to promote best practices and work toward continual improvement throughout their production operations. The PCOC sets forth standards for working conditions and other matters, including compliance with applicable labor practices, workplace environment and compliance with laws. Although we promote ethical business practices, we do not control our suppliers or their labor practices. A failure by any of our suppliers to adhere to these standards or laws could cause us to incur additional costs for our products, could cause negative publicity and harm our business and reputation. We also require our suppliers to meet our standards for product safety, including compliance with applicable laws and standards with respect to safety issues, including lead content in paint. Failure by any of our suppliers to adhere to product safety standards could lead to a product recall, which could result in critical media coverage, harm our business and reputation, and cause us to incur additional costs.In addition, if we, or our suppliers or foreign manufacturers, violate United States or foreign trade laws or regulations, we may be subject to additional duties, significant monetary penalties, the seizure and forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import or the loss of our import privileges. Possible violations of United States or foreign laws or regulations could include inadequate record keeping of our imported products, misstatements or errors as to the origin, classification, marketing or valuation of our imported products, fraudulent visas or labor violations. The effects of these factors could render our conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical and have a negative impact on our operating results.Our retail business depends on our ability to secure affordable and desirable leased locations without creating a competitive concentration of stores.The success of the retail business within our Famous Footwear and Brand Portfolio segments depends, in part, on our ability to secure affordable, long-term leases in desirable locations for our leased retail footwear stores and to secure renewals of such leases. No assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully negotiate lease renewals for existing stores or obtain acceptable terms for new stores in desirable locations. In addition, opening new Famous Footwear stores in our existing markets may result in reduced net sales in existing stores as our stores become more concentrated in the markets we serve. As a result, the number of consumers and financial performance of individual stores may decline and the average sales per square foot at our stores may be reduced.Our reputation and competitive position are dependent on our ability to license well-recognized brands, license our own brands under successful licensing arrangements and protect our intellectual property rights.Licenses - Company as LicenseeAlthough we own most of our wholesale brands, we also rely on our ability to attract, retain and maintain good relationships with licensors that have strong, well-recognized brands and trademarks. Our license agreements are generally for an initial term of two to four years, 13subject to renewal, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these licenses. Even our longer-term or renewable licenses are typically dependent upon our ability to market and sell the licensed products at specified levels, and the failure to meet such levels may result in the termination or non-renewal of such licenses. Furthermore, many of our license agreements require minimum royalty payments, and if we are unable to generate sufficient sales and profitability to cover these minimum royalty requirements, we may be required to make additional payments to the licensors that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, because certain of our license agreements are non-exclusive, new or existing competitors may obtain licenses with overlapping product or geographic terms, resulting in increased competition for a particular market.Licenses - Company as LicensorWe have entered into numerous license agreements with respect to the brands and trademarks that we own. While we have significant control over our licensees’ products and advertising, we generally cannot control their operational and financial issues. If our licensees are not able to meet annual sales and royalty goals, obtain financing, manage their supply chain, control quality and maintain positive relationships with their customers, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. While we would likely have the ability to terminate an underperforming license, it may be difficult and costly to locate an acceptable substitute distributor or licensee, and we may experience a disruption in our sales and brand visibility. In addition, although many of our license agreements prohibit the licensees from entering into licensing arrangements with certain of our competitors, they are generally not prohibited from offering, under other brands, the types of products covered by their license agreements with us.TrademarksWe believe that our trademarks and trade names are important to our success and competitive position because our distinctive marks create a market for our products and distinguish our products from other products. We cannot, however, guarantee that we will be able to secure protection for our intellectual property in the future or that such protection will be adequate for future operations. Furthermore, we face the risk of ineffective protection of intellectual property rights in jurisdictions where we source and distribute our products, some of which do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States. If we are unsuccessful in challenging a party’s products on the basis of infringement of our intellectual property rights, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales, devalue our brands and result in a shift in consumer preference away from our products. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition could be adversely affected.If we are unable to maintain working relationships with our major branded suppliers, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted.Our Famous Footwear segment purchases a substantial portion of its footwear products from major branded suppliers. As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our suppliers. In addition, the success of our financial performance is dependent on the ability of our Famous Footwear segment to obtain products from our suppliers on a timely basis and on acceptable terms. While we believe our relationships with our current suppliers are good, the loss of any of our major suppliers or product developed exclusively for our Famous Footwear stores could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, negative trends in global economic conditions may adversely impact our suppliers. If these third parties do not perform their obligations or are unable to provide us with the materials and services we need at prices and terms that are acceptable to us, our ability to meet our consumers’ demand could be adversely affected.Our quarterly sales and earnings may fluctuate, and securities analysts may not accurately estimate our financial results, which may result in volatility in, or a decline in, our stock price.Our quarterly sales and earnings can vary due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:•Our Famous Footwear retail business is seasonally weighted to the back-to-school season, which falls in our third fiscal quarter. As a result, the success of our back-to-school offering, which is affected by our ability to anticipate consumer demand and fashion trends, could have a disproportionate impact on our full year results. •In our wholesale business, sales of footwear are dependent on orders from our major customers, and they may change delivery schedules, change the mix of products they order or cancel orders without penalty. •Our wholesale customers set the delivery schedule for shipments of our products, which could cause shifts of sales between quarters. •Our estimated annual tax rate is based on projections of our domestic and international operating results for the year, which we review and revise as necessary each quarter.•Our earnings are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, changes in product sales mix, geographic sales trends, weather conditions, consumer sentiment and currency exchange rate fluctuations. 14As a result of these specific and other general factors, our operating results will vary from quarter to quarter and the results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year. Any shortfall in sales or earnings from the levels expected by investors or securities analysts could cause a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.In addition, various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as the analysts’ estimates of our future performance. The analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline.Changes in tax laws, policies and treaties could result in higher taxes, lower profitability, and increased volatility in our financial results.Our financial results are significantly impacted by our effective tax rates, for both domestic and international operations. Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by factors such as changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in permitted deductions, changes in tax laws, interpretations, policies and treaties, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions and any repatriation of earnings from our international operations. The occurrence of such events may result in higher taxes, lower profitability and increased volatility in our financial results.Transitional challenges with business acquisitions or divestitures could result in the inability to achieve our strategic and operating goals.Periodically, we pursue acquisitions of other companies or businesses and divestitures of businesses. In either case, we may not achieve our strategic and operating goals through such activity.  For example, although we review the records of acquisition candidates, the review may not reveal all existing or potential problems. As a result, we may not accurately assess the value of the business and may, accordingly, ultimately assume unknown adverse operating conditions and/or unanticipated liabilities. In addition, the acquired business may not perform as well as expected. We face the risk that the returns on acquisitions will not support the expenditures or indebtedness incurred to acquire or launch such businesses. We also face the risk that we will not be able to integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively. Integration of new businesses may be hindered by, among other things, differing procedures, including internal controls, business practices and technology systems. We may need to allocate more management resources to integration than we planned, which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other profitable activities. In addition, divesting a business may impede progress toward strategic and operating goals.  In connection with a divestiture, we may not successfully divest a business without substantial interruption, expense, delay or other operational or financial problems, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in the unexpected expenditure of time and resources.We are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions (including environmental matters) relating to our business and to our past operations. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are expensive and will require that we devote substantial resources and executive time to defend, thereby diverting management’s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for further discussion of pending matters.Our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by the failure of financial institutions to fulfill their commitments under our Credit Agreement.Our Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which matures on December 18, 2019, is provided by a syndicate of financial institutions, with each institution agreeing severally (and not jointly) to make revolving credit loans to us in an aggregate amount of up to $600.0 million in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for up to an additional $150.0 million of optional availability pursuant to a provision commonly referred to as an “accordion feature.” If one or more of the financial institutions participating in the senior secured revolving credit facility were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment, the portion of the facility provided by such defaulting financial institution might not be available to us.If we are unable to maintain our credit rating, our ability to access capital and interest rates may be negatively impacted.The credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to long-term funding or cause such access to be available at a higher borrowing cost for our operations. We are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. If our ability to access capital becomes constrained, our interest expense will likely increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.15  "
11,CAL,CALERES INC,2014-04-01,"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORS Consumer demand for our products may be adversely impacted by economic conditions. Worldwide economic conditions continue to be uncertain. Consumer confidence and spending are strongly influenced by general economic conditions, including fiscal policy, changing tax and regulatory environment, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, the liquidity of consumers’ assets, health care costs, currency exchange rates, taxation, energy costs, real estate values, foreclosure rates, unemployment trends, and the economic consequences of military action or terrorist activities. Negative economic conditions generally decrease disposable income and, consequently, consumer purchases of discretionary items like our products. Negative trends in economic conditions also drive up the cost of our products, which may require us to increase our product prices. These increases in our product costs, and possibly prices, may not be offset by comparable increases in consumer disposable income. As a result, our customers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or purchase the lower-priced products of our competitors, and our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected.  If we are unable to anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends and successfully apply new technology, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net sales and earnings. The footwear industry is subject to rapidly changing consumer demands and fashion trends. Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change. Accordingly, the success of both our wholesale and retail operations depends largely on our ability to anticipate, understand and react to changing consumer demands and preferences. If we fail to successfully anticipate and respond to changes in consumer demand and fashion trends, develop new products and designs, and implement effective, responsive merchandising and marketing strategies and programs, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories and lower gross margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We operate in a highly competitive industry. Competition is intense in the footwear industry. Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater financial, marketing, and technological resources than we do; others are able to offer footwear on a lateral basis alongside their apparel products; and others have successfully branded their trademarks as lifestyle brands, resulting in greater competitive advantages to those competitors. Low barriers to entry into this industry further intensify competition by allowing new companies to easily enter the markets in which we compete.  Some of our suppliers further compound these competitive pressures by allowing consumers to purchase their products directly through supplier-maintained Internet sites and retail stores. In addition, retailers aggressively compete on the basis of price, which puts competitive pressure on us to keep our wholesale prices low.  We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the footwear industry depends on a number of factors, including style, price, performance, quality, location, and service, as well as the strength of our brand names. We remain competitive by increasing awareness of our brands, improving the efficiency of our supply chain and enhancing the style, comfort, fashion and perceived value of our products. However, our competitors may implement more effective marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, make more attractive offers to potential employees, distribution partners and manufacturers, or respond more quickly to changes in consumer preferences than us. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins, loss of market share, and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand the development and marketing of our products, which could adversely impact our financial results.   Our operating results depend on preparing accurate sales forecasts and properly managing our inventory levels. Using sales forecasts, we place orders with manufacturers for some of our products prior to the time we receive all of our customers’ orders to minimize purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non-delivery. We also maintain an inventory of certain products that we anticipate will be in greater demand. At the retail level, we place orders for product many months in advance of our key selling seasons. Adverse economic conditions and rapidly changing consumer preferences can make it difficult for us and our retail customers to accurately forecast product trends in order to match production with demand. If we fail to accurately assess consumer fashion tastes and the impact of economic factors on consumer spending or to effectively differentiate our retail and wholesale offerings, our inventory levels may exceed customer demand, resulting in inventory write-downs, higher carrying costs, lower gross margins, or the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could significantly impair our financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply the quality products that we require in a  11			 		 timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages may delay shipments to customers (and possibly require us to offer discounts or costly expedited shipping), negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships, adversely impact our sales results, and diminish brand awareness and loyalty. We rely on foreign sources of production, which subjects our business to risks associated with international trade. We rely on foreign sourcing for our footwear products through third-party manufacturing facilities primarily located in China.

If supply issues cause us to be unable to provide products consistent with our standards or manufacture our footwear in a cost and time efficient manner, our customers may cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reductions in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  A cybersecurity breach may adversely affect our sales and reputation. We routinely possess sensitive consumer and associate information. We also provide certain customer and employee data to third parties for analysis, benefit distribution, or compliance purposes. While we  believe we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect that information, hackers and data thieves operate sophisticated, large scale attacks that could breach our information systems, despite ongoing security measures. In addition, we are required to comply with increasingly complex regulations designed to protect our business and personal data. Any breach of our network security, a third-party’s network security or failure to comply with applicable regulations may result in (a) the loss of valuable business data and/or our consumers’ or associates’ personal information, (b) increased costs associated with implementing additional protections and processes, (c) a disruption of our business and a loss of sales, (d) negative media attention, (e) damage to our consumer and associate relationships and reputation, and (f) fines or lawsuits.    We are reliant upon our information technology systems, and any major disruption of these systems could adversely impact our ability to effectively operate our business. Our computer network and systems are essential to all aspects of our operations, including design, pricing, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales, and distribution. Our ability to manage and maintain our inventory and to deliver products in a timely manner depends on these systems. If any of these systems fails to operate as expected, we experience problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, a breach in security occurs, or a natural disaster interrupts system functions, we may experience delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency in our operations or be required to expend significant capital to correct the problem, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  Customer concentration and other trends in customer behavior may lead to a reduction in or loss of sales. Our wholesale customers include national chains, department stores, mass merchandisers, independent retailers, online retailers, and catalogs. Several of our customers operate multiple department store divisions. Furthermore, we often sell multiple types of branded, licensed, and private-label footwear to these same customers. While we believe purchasing decisions in many cases are made  12			 		 independently by the buyers and merchandisers of each of the customers, a decision by a significant customer to decrease the amount of footwear products purchased from us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  In addition, with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, we and our wholesale customers increasingly depend upon a reduced number of key retailers whose bargaining strength is growing. This consolidation may result in the following adverse consequences:  ·Our wholesale customers may seek more favorable terms for their purchases of our products, which could limit our ability to raise prices, recoup cost increases, or achieve our profit goals.  ·The number of stores that carry our products could decline, thereby exposing us to a greater concentration of accounts receivable risk and negatively impacting our brand visibility. We also face the following risks with respect to our customers:  ·Our customers could develop in-house brands or utilize a higher mix of private-label footwear products, which would negatively impact our sales. ·As we sell our products to customers and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer’s financial condition, the financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to stop doing business with that customer, reduce our business with that customer, or be unable to collect from that customer. ·If any of our major wholesale customers experiences a significant downturn in its business or fails to remain committed to our products or brands, then these customers may reduce or discontinue purchases from us. ·Retailers are directly sourcing more of their products directly from manufacturers overseas and reducing their reliance on wholesalers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. A disruption in the effective functioning of our distribution centers could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis.We currently utilize several distribution centers, which are leased or third-party managed. These distribution centers serve as the source of replenishment of inventory for our footwear stores operated by our Famous Footwear and Specialty Retail segments and serve our Wholesale Operations segment. We may be unable to successfully manage, negotiate, or renew our third-party distribution center agreements, or we may experience complications with respect to our distribution centers, such as substantial damage to, or destruction of, such facilities due to natural disasters or ineffective information technology systems. In such an event, our other distribution centers may not be able to support the resulting additional distribution demands and we may be unable to locate alternative persons or entities capable of fulfilling our distribution needs, resulting in an adverse effect on our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis. Foreign currency fluctuations may result in higher costs and decreased gross profits.Although we purchase most of our products from foreign manufacturers in United States dollars and otherwise engage in foreign currency hedging transactions, we cannot ensure that we will not experience cost variations with respect to exchange rate changes. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may also adversely impact third parties who manufacture the Company’s products by making their purchases of raw materials or other production costs more expensive and more difficult to finance, resulting in higher prices and lower margins for the Company, its distributors, and licensees. Additional duties, quotas, tariffs and other trade restrictions may be imposed on our foreign sourced products, adversely affecting our sales and profitability.   Our foreign sourced products are subject to duties collected by customs authorities when imported to the United States or other countries. We cannot predict whether additional customs duties, quotas, tariffs, anti-dumping duties, safeguard measures, cargo restrictions or other trade restrictions may be imposed on the importation of our products in the future. Such additional charges may result in increases in the cost of our products and may adversely affect our sales and profitability. Our business, sales and brand value could be harmed by violations of labor, trade or other laws.  We focus on doing business with those suppliers who share our commitment to responsible business practices and the principles set forth in our Production Code of Conduct (the “PCOC”). By requiring our suppliers to comply with the PCOC, we encourage our suppliers to promote best practices and work toward continual improvement throughout their production operations. The PCOC sets forth standards for working conditions and other matters, including compliance with applicable labor practices, workplace environment, and compliance with laws. Although we promote ethical business practices, we do not control our suppliers or their labor practices. A failure by any of our suppliers to adhere to these standards or laws could cause us to incur additional costs for our products, could cause negative publicity, and harm our business and reputation. We also require our suppliers to meet our standards for product safety, including compliance with applicable laws and standards with respect to safety issues, including lead content in paint. Failure by any of  13			 		 our suppliers to adhere to product safety standards could lead to a product recall, which could result in critical media coverage, harm our business and reputation, and cause us to incur additional costs. In addition, if we, or our suppliers or foreign manufacturers, violate United States or foreign trade laws or regulations, we may be subject to additional duties, significant monetary penalties, the seizure and forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import, or the loss of our import privileges. Possible violations of United States or foreign laws or regulations could include inadequate record keeping of our imported products, misstatements or errors as to the origin, classification, marketing or valuation of our imported products, fraudulent visas, or labor violations. The effects of these factors could render our conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical and have a negative impact on our operating results. Our success depends on our ability to retain senior management and recruit and retain other key associates. Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified management, administrative, product development, and sales personnel to support existing operations and future growth. In addition, our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses often depends on our ability to retain incumbent personnel, many of whom possess valuable institutional knowledge and operating experience. Competition for qualified personnel in the footwear industry is intense, and we compete for these individuals with other companies that in many cases have superior financial and other resources. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management, the inability to attract and retain other qualified personnel, or the inability to effectively transition senior management positions could adversely affect the sales, design and production of our products as well as the implementation of our strategic initiatives. Our reputation and competitive position are dependent on our ability to license well-recognized brands, license our own brands under successful licensing arrangements, and protect our intellectual property rights.   Licenses – Company as LicenseeAlthough we own most of our wholesale brands, we also rely on our ability to attract, retain, and maintain good relationships with licensors that have strong, well-recognized brands and trademarks. Our license agreements are generally for an initial term of two to four years, subject to renewal, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these licenses. Even our longer-term or renewable licenses are typically dependent upon our ability to market and sell the licensed products at specified levels, and the failure to meet such levels may result in the termination or non-renewal of such licenses. Furthermore, many of our license agreements require minimum royalty payments, and if we are unable to generate sufficient sales and profitability to cover these minimum royalty requirements, we may be required to make additional payments to the licensors that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, because certain of our license agreements are non-exclusive, new or existing competitors may obtain licenses with overlapping product or geographic terms, resulting in increased competition for a particular market.  Licenses – Company as LicensorWe have entered into numerous license agreements with respect to the brands and trademarks that we own. While we have significant control over our licensees’ products and advertising, we generally cannot control their operational and financial issues. If our licensees are not able to meet annual sales and royalty goals, obtain financing, manage their supply chain, control quality, and maintain positive relationships with their customers, our business, results of operations, and financial position may be adversely affected. While we would likely have the ability to terminate an underperforming license, it may be difficult and costly to locate an acceptable substitute distributor or licensee, and we may experience a disruption in our sales and brand visibility. In addition, although many of our license agreements prohibit the licensees from entering into licensing arrangements with certain of our competitors, they are generally not prohibited from offering, under other brands, the types of products covered by their license agreements with us.  Trademarks We believe that our trademarks and trade names are important to our success and competitive position because our distinctive marks create a market for our products and distinguish our products from other products. We cannot, however, guarantee that we will be able to secure protection for our intellectual property in the future or that such protection will be adequate for future operations. Furthermore, we face the risk of ineffective protection of intellectual property rights in jurisdictions where we source and distribute our products, some of which do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States. If we are unsuccessful in challenging a party’s products on the basis of infringement of our intellectual property rights, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales, devalue our brands, and result in a shift in consumer preference away from our products. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition could be adversely affected.   Our retail business depends on our ability to secure affordable and desirable leased locations without creating a competitive concentration of stores. Our Famous Footwear and Specialty Retail segments operate leased retail footwear stores. Accordingly, the success of our retail business depends, in part, on our ability to secure affordable, long-term leases in desirable locations and to secure renewals of such leases. No assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully negotiate lease renewals for existing stores or obtain acceptable  14			 		 terms for new stores in desirable locations. In addition, opening new Famous Footwear stores in our existing markets may result in reduced net sales in existing stores as our stores become more concentrated in the markets we serve. As a result, the number of consumers and financial performance of individual stores may decline and the average sales per square foot at our stores may be reduced.  If we are unable to maintain working relationships with our major branded suppliers, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows may be adversely impacted. Our Famous Footwear segment purchases a substantial portion of its footwear products from major branded suppliers. As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our suppliers. In addition, the success of our financial performance is dependent on the ability of Famous Footwear to obtain products from our suppliers on a timely basis and on acceptable terms. While we believe our relationships with our current suppliers are good, the loss of any of our major suppliers or product developed exclusively for Famous Footwear could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, negative trends in global economic conditions may adversely impact our suppliers. If these third parties do not perform their obligations or are unable to provide us with the materials and services we need at prices and terms that are acceptable to us, our ability to meet our consumers’ demand could be adversely affected.  Our quarterly sales and earnings may fluctuate, and securities analysts may not accurately estimate our financial results, which may result in volatility in, or a decline in, our stock price. Our quarterly sales and earnings can vary due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:  ·Our Famous Footwear retail business is seasonally weighted to the back-to-school season, which falls in our third fiscal quarter. As a result, the success of our back-to-school offering, which is affected by our ability to anticipate consumer demand and fashion trends, could have a disproportionate impact on our full year results.  ·In our wholesale business, sales of footwear are dependent on orders from our major customers, and they may change delivery schedules, change the mix of products they order, or cancel orders without penalty.  ·Our wholesale customers set the delivery schedule for shipments of our products, which could cause shifts of sales between quarters.  ·Our estimated annual tax rate is based on projections of our domestic and international operating results for the year, which we review and revise as necessary each quarter. ·Our earnings are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, changes in product sales mix, geographic sales trends, weather conditions, consumer sentiment, and currency exchange rate fluctuations.  As a result of these specific and other general factors, our operating results will vary from quarter to quarter, and the results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year. Any shortfall in sales or earnings from the levels expected by investors or securities analysts could cause a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.  In addition, various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as the analysts’ estimates of our future performance. The analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline.  Changes in tax laws, policies, and treaties could result in higher taxes, lower profitability, and increased volatility in our financial results. Our financial results are significantly impacted by our effective tax rates, for both domestic and international operations. Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by factors such as changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in permitted deductions, changes in tax laws, interpretations, policies and treaties, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions, and any repatriation of earnings from our international operations. The occurrence of such events may result in higher taxes, lower profitability, and increased volatility in our financial results.  Transitional challenges with business acquisitions or divestitures could result in the inability to achieve our strategic and operating goals. Periodically, we pursue acquisitions of other companies or businesses and divestitures of businesses.  In either case, we may not achieve our strategic and operating goals through such activity.  For example, although we review the records of acquisition candidates, the review may not reveal all existing or potential problems. As a result, we may not accurately assess the value of the business and may, accordingly, ultimately assume unknown adverse operating conditions and/or unanticipated liabilities. In addition, the acquired business may not perform as well as expected. We face the risk that the returns on acquisitions will not support the expenditures or indebtedness incurred to acquire or launch such businesses. We also face the risk that we will not be able to integrate acquisitions into our existing  15			 		 operations effectively. Integration of new businesses may be hindered by, among other things, differing procedures, including internal controls, business practices, and technology systems. We may need to allocate more management resources to integration than we planned, which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other profitable activities. In addition, divesting a business may impede progress toward strategic and operating goals.  In connection with a divestiture, we may not successfully divest a business without substantial interruption, expense, delay, or other operational or financial problems, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected by the failure of financial institutions to fulfill their commitments under our Credit Agreement. Our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which matures on January 7, 2016, is provided by a syndicate of financial institutions, with each institution agreeing severally (and not jointly) to make revolving credit loans to us in an aggregate amount of up to $530.0 million in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for up to an additional $150.0 million of optional availability pursuant to a provision commonly referred to as an “accordion feature.” If one or more of the financial institutions participating in the senior secured revolving credit facility were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment, the portion of the facility provided by such defaulting financial institution might not be available to us. If we are unable to maintain our credit rating, our ability to access capital and interest rates may be negatively impacted. The credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to long-term funding or cause such access to be available at a higher borrowing cost for our operations. We are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. If our ability to access capital becomes constrained, our interest expense will likely increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  We are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in the unexpected expenditure of time and resources. We are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions (including environmental matters) relating to our business and to our past operations. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are expensive and will require that we devote substantial resources and executive time to defend, thereby diverting management’s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for further discussion of pending matters.  Rising insurance costs could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We self-insure a significant portion of our expected losses under our workers’ compensation, employment practices, health, disability, cyber risk, general liability, automobile, and property programs, among others. The liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are estimated by considering our historical claims experience and data from actuarial sources. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be affected if claims differ from the assumptions used and historical trends. Unanticipated changes in the estimates underlying our reserves for these losses, such as claims experience, inflation, and regulatory changes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  Comprehensive health care reform legislation provisions have become effective which, among other things, includes guaranteed coverage requirements, eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions, and annual lifetime maximum limits, restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded, and imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits. Possible adverse effects of the health reform legislation include increased costs, exposure to expanded liability, and requirements for us to revise ways in which we conduct business. We are subject to the SEC’s “conflict minerals” disclosure obligations.The Company is subject to recently adopted SEC disclosure obligations relating to its use of tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold (commonly referred to as conflict minerals) sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. Some of these conflict minerals are present in our products. The disclosure obligations are complex, and there is little formal guidance with respect to their application. The first reports under the disclosure obligations are required to be filed with the SEC no later than June 2, 2014 relating to the Company's activities during 2013.   Although we expect to be able to file the required reports on time, in preparing to do so, we are dependent upon the implementation of new systems and processes and information supplied by our suppliers of products that contain, or potentially contain, conflict minerals. To the extent that the information that we receive from our suppliers is inaccurate or inadequate or our processes in obtaining that information do not fulfill the SEC's requirements, we could face both reputational and SEC enforcement risks as well as significant costs related to the compliance process.  16			 		  						 "
8,CAL,CALERES INC,2013-04-02,"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORS Economic conditions have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, consumer demand for our products. Over the last several years, worldwide economic conditions deteriorated in many countries and regions, including the United States. Despite some positive trends throughout 2012, business conditions may remain uncertain for the foreseeable future due in part to cautious consumer spending. Consumer confidence and spending are strongly influenced by general economic conditions, including U.S. fiscal policy, changing tax and regulatory environment, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, the liquidity of consumers’ assets, health care costs, currency exchange rates, taxation, gasoline prices, real estate values, foreclosure rates, unemployment trends and the economic consequences of military action or terrorist activities. Negative economic conditions generally decrease disposable income and, consequently, consumer purchases of discretionary items like our products. Negative trends in economic conditions also drive up the cost of our products, which may require us to increase the price of our products. These increases in our product costs, and possibly prices, may not be offset by comparable increases in consumer disposable income. As a result, our customers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or purchase the lower-priced products of our competitors, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.  If we are unable to anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends and successfully apply new technology, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net sales and earnings. The footwear industry is subject to rapidly changing consumer demands and fashion trends. Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change. Accordingly, the success of both our wholesale and retail operations depends largely on our ability to anticipate, understand and react to changing consumer demands and preferences. Our performance athletic and outdoor footwear brands are subject to additional challenges related to rapid changes in footwear technology, the availability of high quality endorsers and the possibility of negative expert opinions on the unique technologies and designs of our performance footwear brands.  If we fail to successfully anticipate and respond to changes in consumer demand and fashion trends, develop new products and designs and implement effective, responsive merchandising and marketing strategies and programs, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories and lower gross margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We operate in a highly competitive industry. Competition is intense in the footwear industry. Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater financial, marketing and technological resources than we do; others are able to offer footwear on a lateral basis alongside their apparel products; and others have successfully branded their trademarks as lifestyle brands, resulting in greater competitive advantages to those competitors. Low barriers to entry into this industry further intensify competition by allowing new companies to easily enter the markets in which we compete.  In addition, retailers aggressively compete on the basis of price, which puts competitive pressure on us to keep our prices low. Some of our suppliers further compound these competitive pressures by allowing consumers to purchase their products directly through supplier maintained Internet sites and retail stores.   We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the footwear industry depends on a number of factors, including style, price, performance, quality, location and service as well as the strength of our brand-names. We remain competitive by increasing awareness of our brands, improving the efficiency of our supply chain and enhancing the style, comfort, fashion and perceived value of our products. However, our competitors may implement more effective marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, make more attractive offers to potential employees, distribution partners and manufacturers, or respond more quickly to changes in consumer preferences than us. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand the development and marketing of our products, which could adversely impact our financial results.   Our operating results depend on preparing accurate sales forecasts and properly managing our inventory levels. Using sales forecasts, we place orders with manufacturers for some of our products prior to the time we receive all of our customers’ orders to minimize purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non-delivery. We also maintain an inventory of certain products that we anticipate will be in greater demand. However, the global economic slowdown and rapidly changing consumer preferences can make it difficult for us and our customers to accurately forecast product trends in order to match production with demand. If we fail to accurately assess consumer fashion tastes and the impact of economic factors on consumer  11			 		 spending or to effectively differentiate our retail and wholesale offerings, our inventory levels may exceed customer demand, resulting in inventory write-downs, higher carrying costs, lower gross margins or the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could significantly impair our financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply the quality products that we require in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages may delay shipments to customers (and possibly require us to offer discounts or costly expedited shipping), negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships, adversely impact our sales results and diminish brand awareness and loyalty. We rely on foreign sources of production, which subjects our business to risks associated with international trade. We rely on foreign sourcing for our footwear products primarily through third-party manufacturing facilities located in China. At times, we are the exclusive customer of these third-party manufacturing facilities. As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our third-party foreign manufacturers. Foreign sourcing is subject to numerous risks, including trade relations, disease outbreaks, work stoppages, transportation delays, political instability, foreign currency fluctuations, variable economic conditions, expropriation, nationalization, natural disasters, terrorist acts and military conflict and changes in governmental regulations (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and climate change legislation).  At the same time, potential changes in Chinese manufacturing preferences, including, but not limited to the following, pose additional risk and uncertainty:   • Manufacturing capacity in China may shift from footwear to other industries with manufacturing margins that are perceived to be higher. • Growth in domestic footwear consumption in China could lead to a significant decrease in factory space available for the manufacture of footwear to be exported. • Currently, many footwear manufacturers in China are facing labor shortages as migrant workers seek better wages and working conditions in other industries and vocations. As a result of these risks, there can be no assurance that we will not experience reductions in the available production capacity, increases in our manufacturing costs, late deliveries or terminations of our supplier relationships. Furthermore these risks are compounded by the lack of diversification in the geographic location of our foreign sourcing and manufacturing. With almost all of our supply originating in China, a substantial portion of our supply could be at risk in the event of any negative development related to China.   Although we believe we could find alternative manufacturing sources for the products that we currently source from China through other third-party manufacturing facilities in China or other countries, we may not be able to locate alternative manufacturers on terms as favorable as our current terms, including pricing, payment terms, manufacturing capacity, quality standards and lead times for delivery. In addition, there is substantial competition in the footwear industry for quality footwear manufacturers. Accordingly, our future results will partly depend on our ability to maintain positive working relationships with, and offer competitive terms to, our foreign manufacturers. If supply issues cause us to be unable to provide products consistent with our standards or manufacture our footwear in a cost and time efficient manner, our customers may cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reductions in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Customer concentration and other trends in customer behavior may lead to a reduction in or loss of sales. Our wholesale customers include national chains, department stores, independent retailers, mass merchandisers, online retailers and catalogs. Several of our customers operate multiple department store divisions. Furthermore, we often sell multiple types of licensed, branded and private-label footwear to these same national chains, department stores, independent retailers, mass merchandisers, online retailers and catalogs. While we believe purchasing decisions in many cases are made independently by the buyers and merchandisers of each of the customers, a decision by a significant customer to decrease the amount of footwear products purchased from us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  In addition, with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, we and our wholesale customers increasingly depend upon a reduced number of key retailers whose bargaining strength is growing. This consolidation may result in the following adverse consequences:  ·Our wholesale customers may seek more favorable terms for their purchases of our products, which could limit our ability to raise prices, recoup cost increases or achieve our profit goals.  ·The number of stores that carry our products could decline, thereby exposing us to a greater concentration of accounts receivable risk and negatively impacting our brand visibility. We also face the following risks with respect to our customers:  ·Our customers could develop in-house brands or utilize a higher mix of private label footwear products, which would negatively impact our sales. 12			 		  ·As we sell our products to customers and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer’s financial condition, the financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to stop doing business with that customer, reduce our business with that customer or be unable to collect from that customer. ·If any of our major wholesale customers experiences a significant downturn in its business or fails to remain committed to our products or brands, then these customers may reduce or discontinue purchases from us. ·Retailers are directly sourcing more of their products directly from manufacturers overseas and reducing their reliance on wholesalers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are reliant upon our information technology systems, and any major disruption of these systems could adversely impact our reputation and our ability to effectively operate our business. Our computer network and systems are essential to all aspects of our operations, including design, pricing, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution. Our ability to manage and maintain our inventory and to deliver products in a timely manner depends on these systems. If any of these systems fails to operate as expected, we experience problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, a breach in security occurs or a natural disaster interrupts system functions, we may experience delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency in our operations or be required to expend significant capital to correct the problem, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  A disruption in the effective functioning of our distribution centers could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis.We currently utilize several distribution centers, which are leased or third-party managed. These distribution centers serve as the source of replenishment of inventory for our footwear stores operated by our Famous Footwear and Specialty Retail segments and serve our Wholesale Operations segment. We may be unable to successfully manage, negotiate or renew our third-party distribution center agreements, or we may experience complications with respect to our distribution centers, such as substantial damage to or destruction of such facilities due to natural disasters or ineffective information technology systems. In such an event, our other distribution centers may not be able to support the resulting additional distribution demands and we may be unable to locate alternative persons or entities capable of fulfilling our distribution needs, resulting in an adverse effect on our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis. While we maintain business interruption insurance, it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects caused by significant disruptions in our distribution centers.Foreign currency fluctuations may result in higher costs and decreased gross profits.Although we purchase most of our products from foreign manufacturers in United States dollars and otherwise engage in foreign currency hedging transactions, we cannot ensure that we will not experience cost variations with respect to exchange rate changes. For example, although we purchase footwear made in China using United States dollars, Chinese manufacturers have been increasing their United States dollar prices to compensate for the appreciation of the Chinese currency against the United States dollar. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may also adversely impact third parties who manufacture the Company’s products by making their purchases of raw materials or other production costs more expensive and more difficult to finance, resulting in higher prices and lower margins for the Company, its distributors and licensees. Additional duties, quotas, tariffs and other trade restrictions may be imposed on our foreign sourced products, adversely affecting our sales and profitability.   Our foreign sourced products are subject to duties collected by customs authorities when imported to the United States or other countries. We cannot predict whether additional customs duties, quotas, tariffs, anti-dumping duties, safeguard measures, cargo restrictions or other trade restrictions may be imposed on the importation of our products in the future. Such additional charges may result in increases in the cost of our products and may adversely affect our sales and profitability. Our business, sales and brand value could be harmed by violations of labor, trade or other laws.  We focus on doing business with those suppliers who share our commitment to responsible business practices and the principles set forth in our Production Code of Conduct (the “PCOC”). By requiring our suppliers to comply with the PCOC, we encourage our suppliers to promote best practices and work towards continual improvement throughout their production operations. The PCOC sets forth standards for working conditions and other matters, including compliance with applicable labor practices, workplace environment and compliance with laws. Although we promote ethical business practices, we do not control our suppliers or their labor practices. A failure by any of our suppliers to adhere to these standards or laws could cause us to incur additional costs for our products, could cause negative publicity and harm our business and reputation. We also require our suppliers to meet our standards for product safety, including compliance with applicable laws and standards with respect to safety issues, including lead content in paint. A failure by any of our suppliers to adhere to product safety standards could lead to a product recall, which could result in critical media coverage, harm our business and reputation and cause us to incur additional costs. 13			 		 In addition, if we, or our suppliers or foreign manufacturers, violate United States or foreign trade laws or regulations, we may be subject to additional duties, significant monetary penalties, the seizure and forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import or the loss of our import privileges. Possible violations of United States or foreign laws or regulations could include inadequate record keeping of our imported products, misstatements or errors as to the origin, classification, marketing or valuation of our imported products, fraudulent visas or labor violations. The effects of these factors could render our conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical and have a negative impact on our operating results. We face additional risks relating to operating manufacturing facilities in China.We operate manufacturing facilities in China. These manufacturing facilities are subject to many of the same risks as our third-party foreign sourcing arrangements, described above, but we may be more directly impacted by any negative developments in China with respect to our manufacturing facilities. Our operations in China and, consequently, our ability to deliver products on time and on terms satisfactory to us may be subject to risks such as the following:   ·inflation or changes in political and economic conditions; ·unstable regulatory environments; ·changes in import and export duties; ·not maintaining appropriate capacity; ·domestic and foreign customs and tariffs; ·potentially adverse tax consequences; ·trade restrictions; ·possible expropriation and nationalization; ·restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of China; ·natural disasters; ·labor unrest and/or shortages; and ·logistical and communications challenges. In addition, we lease the land on which these Chinese manufacturing facilities are located from the Chinese government through land use rights agreements. Although we believe that we have a positive relationship with the Chinese government, if the Chinese government decided to terminate our land use rights agreements, our ability to fulfill our customers’ orders may be negatively impacted. These risks may have an adverse effect on our Chinese manufacturing operations and our overall business and results of operations. We may fail to protect the integrity and security of consumer and associate information. We routinely possess sensitive consumer and associate information as well as provide certain customer and employee data to third-parties for analysis, benefit distribution or compliance purposes. We have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect that information. However, hackers and data thieves operate sophisticated, large scale attacks that could result in a breach of our security. In addition, we are required to comply with increasingly complex regulations designed to protect our business and personal data. Any breach of our network security, a third-party’s network security or failure to comply with applicable regulations may result in (a) the loss of valuable business data and/or our consumers’ or associates’ personal information, (b) increased costs associated with implementing additional protections and processes, (c) a disruption of our business and a loss of sales, (d) negative media attention, (e) damage to our consumer and associate relationships and reputation, and (f) fines or lawsuits.    Our success depends on our ability to retain senior management and recruit and retain other key associates. Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified management, administrative, product development and sales personnel to support existing operations and future growth. In addition, our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses often depends on our ability to retain incumbent personnel, many of whom possess valuable institutional knowledge and operating experience. Competition for qualified personnel in the footwear industry is intense, and we compete for these individuals with other companies that in many cases have superior financial and other resources. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management, the inability to attract and retain other qualified personnel or the inability to effectively transition senior management positions could adversely affect the sales, design and production of our products as well as the implementation of our strategic initiatives.  14			 		 Our reputation and competitive position are dependent on our ability to license well-recognized brands, license our own brands under successful licensing arrangements and protect our intellectual property rights.   Licenses – Company as LicenseeAlthough we own many of our wholesale brands, we also rely on our ability to attract, retain and maintain good relationships with licensors that have strong, well-recognized brands and trademarks. Our license agreements are generally for an initial term of two to four years, subject to renewal, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these licenses. Even our longer-term or renewable licenses are typically dependent upon our ability to market and sell the licensed products at specified levels, and the failure to meet such levels may result in the termination or non-renewal of such licenses. Furthermore, many of our license agreements require minimum royalty payments, and if we are unable to generate sufficient sales and profitability to cover these minimum royalty requirements, we may be required to make additional payments to the licensors that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, because certain of our license agreements are non-exclusive, new or existing competitors may obtain licenses with overlapping product or geographic terms, resulting in increased competition for a particular market.  Licenses – Company as LicensorWe have entered into numerous license agreements with respect to the brands and trademarks that we own. While we have significant control over our licensees’ products and advertising, we generally cannot control their operational and financial issues. If our licensees are not able to meet annual sales and royalty goals, obtain financing, manage their supply chain, control quality and maintain positive relationships with their customers, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. While we would likely have the ability to terminate an underperforming license, it may be difficult and costly to locate an acceptable substitute distributor or licensee, and we may experience a disruption in our sales and brand visibility. In addition, although many of our license agreements prohibit the licensees from entering into licensing arrangements with certain of our competitors, they are generally not prohibited from offering, under other brands, the types of products covered by their license agreements with us.  Trademarks We believe that our trademarks and trade names are important to our success and competitive position because our distinctive marks create a market for our products and distinguish our products from other products. We cannot, however, guarantee that we will be able to secure protection for our intellectual property in the future or that such protection will be adequate for future operations. Furthermore, we face the risk of ineffective protection of intellectual property rights in jurisdictions where we source and distribute our products, some of which do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States. If we are unsuccessful in challenging a party’s products on the basis of infringement of our intellectual property rights, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales, devalue our brands and result in a shift in consumer preference away from our products. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition could be adversely affected.   Our retail business depends on our ability to secure affordable and desirable leased locations without creating a competitive concentration of stores. Our Famous Footwear and Specialty Retail segments operate leased retail footwear stores. Accordingly, the success of our retail business depends, in part, on our ability to secure affordable, long-term leases in desirable locations and to secure renewals of such leases. No assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully negotiate lease renewals for existing stores or obtain acceptable terms for new stores in desirable locations. In addition, opening new Famous Footwear stores in our existing markets may result in reduced net sales in existing stores as our stores become more concentrated in the markets we serve. As a result, the number of consumers and financial performance of individual stores may decline and the average sales per square foot at our stores may be reduced.  If we are unable to maintain working relationships with our major branded suppliers, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted. Our Famous Footwear segment purchases a substantial portion of its footwear products from major branded suppliers. As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our suppliers. In addition, the success of our financial performance is dependent on the ability of Famous Footwear to obtain products from our suppliers on a timely basis and on acceptable terms. While we believe our relationships with our current suppliers are good, the loss of any of our major suppliers or product developed exclusively for Famous Footwear could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, negative trends in global economic conditions may adversely impact our suppliers. If these third-parties do not perform their obligations or are unable to provide us with the materials and services we need at prices and terms that are acceptable to us, our ability to meet our consumers’ demand could be adversely affected.  Our quarterly sales and earnings may fluctuate, and securities analysts may not accurately estimate our financial results, which may result in volatility in, or a decline in, our stock price. Our quarterly sales and earnings can vary due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following: 15			 		   ·Our Famous Footwear retail business is seasonally weighted to the back-to-school season, which falls in our third fiscal quarter. As a result, the success of our back-to-school offering, which is affected by our ability to anticipate consumer demand and fashion trends, could have a disproportionate impact on our full year results.  ·In our wholesale business, sales of footwear are dependent on orders from our major customers, and they may change delivery schedules, change the mix of products they order or cancel orders without penalty.  ·Our wholesale customers set the delivery schedule for shipments of our products, which could cause shifts of sales between quarters.  ·Our estimated annual tax rate is based on projections of our domestic and international operating results for the year, which we review and revise as necessary each quarter. ·Our earnings are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, changes in product sales mix, geographic sales trends, consumer sentiment and currency exchange rate fluctuations.  As a result of these specific and other general factors, our operating results will vary from quarter to quarter, and the results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year. Any shortfall in sales or earnings from the levels expected by investors or securities analysts could cause a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.  In addition, various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as the analysts’ estimates of our future performance. The analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline.  Changes in tax laws, policies and treaties could result in higher taxes, lower profitability and increased volatility in our financial results. Our financial results are significantly impacted by our effective tax rates, for both domestic and international operations. Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by factors such as changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in permitted deductions, changes in tax laws, interpretations, policies and treaties, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions and any repatriation of earnings from our international operations. The occurrence of such events may result in higher taxes, lower profitability and increased volatility in our financial results.  Transitional challenges with acquisitions and/or joint ventures could result in unexpected expenditures of time and resources. Periodically, we pursue acquisitions of other companies or businesses and/or joint ventures. Although we review the records of acquisition candidates, the review may not reveal all existing or potential problems. As a result, we may not accurately assess the value of the business and may, accordingly, ultimately assume unknown adverse operating conditions and/or unanticipated liabilities. In addition, the business may not perform as well as expected. We face the risk that the returns on acquisitions and/or joint ventures will not support the expenditures or indebtedness incurred to acquire or launch such businesses. We also face the risk that we will not be able to integrate acquisitions and/or joint ventures into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense, delay or other operational or financial problems. Integration may be hindered by, among other things, differing procedures, including internal controls, business practices and technology systems. We may need to allocate more management resources to integration than we planned, which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other profitable activities.  Our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by the failure of financial institutions to fulfill their commitments under our Credit Agreement. Our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which matures on January 7, 2016, is provided by a syndicate of financial institutions, with each institution agreeing severally (and not jointly) to make revolving credit loans to us in an aggregate amount of up to $530.0 million in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for up to an additional $150.0 million of optional availability pursuant to a provision commonly referred to as an “accordion feature.” If one or more of the financial institutions participating in the senior secured revolving credit facility were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment, the portion of the facility provided by such defaulting financial institution might not be available to us. If we are unable to maintain our credit rating, our ability to access capital and interest rates may be negatively impacted. The credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to long-term funding or cause such access to be available at a higher borrowing cost for our operations. We are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. If our ability to access capital becomes constrained, our interest expense will likely increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.   16			 		 We may be unable to gain the expected efficiencies from our key strategic initiatives.In 2011, we conducted a review of our portfolio to identify and take action around businesses that either do not fit our target consumer platforms – family, healthy living and contemporary fashion – or that are underperforming. As a result of this review, we announced that we would be exiting certain unprofitable portions of our business,  closing certain stores and making other infrastructure changes. We continue to take actions to respond to this review in an effort to focus on our target consumer platforms, maximize operating efficiency and shareholder value and reduce costs. Achievement of our strategic goals depends in part on our ability to identify, develop and execute initiatives appropriately and effectively. There can be no assurance that we will gain the expected efficiencies from our strategic initiatives within a targeted timeframe or within targeted costs. Our ability to grow in the future depends upon, among other things, the continued success of our efforts to maintain our brand image and expand our footwear offerings and retail and wholesale distribution channels. As our business grows, we may need to improve and enhance our overall financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures to effectively manage our growth. We may be unable to successfully implement our current growth strategy or other growth strategies or effectively manage our growth, any of which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in the unexpected expenditure of time and resources. We are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions (including environmental matters) relating to our business and to our past operations. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are expensive and will require that we devote substantial resources and executive time to defend, thereby diverting management’s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for further discussion of pending matters.  Rising insurance costs could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We self-insure a significant portion of our expected losses under our workers’ compensation, employment practices, health, disability, cyber risk, general liability, automobile and property programs, among others. The liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are estimated by considering our historical claims experience and data from actuarial sources. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be affected if claims differ from the assumptions used and historical trends. Unanticipated changes in the estimates underlying our reserves for these losses, such as claims experience, inflation and regulatory changes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  Comprehensive health care reform legislation provisions have become effective which, among other things, includes guaranteed coverage requirements, eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions and annual lifetime maximum limits, restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded and imposes new and significant taxes on healthy insurers and health care benefits. Possible adverse effects of the health reform legislation include increased costs, exposure to expanded liability and requirements for us to revise ways in which we conduct business. We are subject to legislative or regulatory initiatives related to global warming/climate change concerns, which could negatively affect our business. There has been an increasing focus and debate on global climate change, including increased attention from regulatory agencies and legislative bodies. This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an unspecified array of environmental matters. Legislative, regulatory or other efforts to globally combat climate change could have negative implications, including, but not limited to, future tax increases, increased costs of transportation and utilities and other cost increases imposed on foreign sources of production, all of which could decrease our operating earnings. We are unable to predict the potential effects that any such future initiatives may have on our business.   						 "
14,CAL,CALERES INC,2012-03-27,"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORSEconomic conditions have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, consumer demand for our products.Over the last few years, worldwide economic conditions deteriorated in many countries and regions, including the United States. Despite some positive trends throughout 2011, business conditions may remain uncertain for the foreseeable future due in part to cautious consumer spending. Consumer confidence and spending are strongly influenced by general economic conditions, including U.S. fiscal policy, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, the liquidity of consumers’ assets, health care costs, currency exchange rates, taxation, gasoline prices, real estate values, foreclosure rates, unemployment trends and the economic consequences of military action or terroristactivities. Negative economic conditions generally decrease disposable income and, consequently, consumer purchases of discretionary items like our products. Negative trends in economic conditions also drive up the cost of our products, which may require us to increase the price of our products. These increases in our product costs, and possibly prices, may not be offset by comparable increases in consumer disposable income. As a result, our customers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or purchase the lower-priced products of our competitors, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends and successfully apply new technology, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net sales and earnings.The footwear industry is subject to rapidly changing consumer demands and fashion trends. Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change. Accordingly, the success of both our wholesale and retail operations depends largely on our ability to anticipate, understand and react to changing consumer demands and preferences. Our performance athletic and outdoor footwear brands are subject to additional challenges related to rapid changes in footwear technology, the availability of high quality endorsers and the possibility of negative expert opinions on the unique technologies and designs of our performance footwearbrands.  If we fail to successfully anticipate and respond to changes in consumer demand and fashion trends, develop new products and designs and implement effective, responsive merchandising and marketing strategies and programs, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories and lower gross margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  10  We operate in a highly competitive industry.Competition is intense in the footwear industry. Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater financial, marketing and technological resources than we do; others are able to offer footwear on a lateral basis alongside their apparel products; and others have successfully branded their trademarks as lifestyle brands, resulting in greater competitive advantages to those competitors. Low barriers to entry into this industry further intensify competition by allowing new companies to easily enter the markets in which we compete.  In addition, retailers aggressively compete on the basis of price, which puts competitive pressure on us to keep our prices low. Some of our suppliers further compound thesecompetitive pressures by allowing consumers to purchase their products directly through supplier maintained Internet sites and retail stores.We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the footwear industry depends on a number of factors, including style, price, performance, quality, location and service as well as the strength of our brand-names. We remain competitive by increasing awareness of our brands, improving the efficiency of our supply chain and enhancing the style, comfort, fashion and perceived value of our products. However, our competitors may implement more effective marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, make more attractive offers to potential employees, distribution partners and manufacturers, or respond more quickly to changes in consumer preferences than us. As a result, we may not be able to competesuccessfully in the future, and increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand the development and marketing of our products, which could adversely impact our financial results. Our operating results depend on preparing accurate sales forecasts and properly managing our inventory levels.Using sales forecasts, we place orders with manufacturers for some of our products prior to the time we receive all of our customers’ orders to minimize purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non-delivery. We also maintain an inventory of certain products that we anticipate will be in greater demand. However, the global economic slowdown and rapidly changing consumer preferences can make it difficult for us and our customers to accurately forecast product trends in order to match production with demand. If we fail to accurately assess consumer fashion tastes and the impact of economic factors on consumer spending or to effectively differentiate our retail and wholesaleofferings, our inventory levels may exceed customer demand, resulting in inventory write-downs, higher carrying costs, lower gross margins or the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could significantly impair our financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply the quality products that we require in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages may delay shipments to customers (and possibly require us to offer discounts or costly expedited shipping), negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships, adversely impact our sales results and diminish brand awareness and loyalty.We rely on foreign sources of production, which subjects our business to risks associated with international trade.We rely on foreign sourcing for our footwear products primarily through third-party manufacturing facilities located in China. At times, we are the exclusive customer of these third-party manufacturing facilities. As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our third-party foreign manufacturers. Foreign sourcing is subject to numerous risks, including trade relations, disease outbreaks, work stoppages, transportation delays, political instability, foreign currency fluctuations, variable economic conditions, expropriation, nationalization, terrorist acts and military conflict and changes in governmental regulations (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and climate changelegislation).  At the same time, potential changes in Chinese manufacturing preferences, including, but not limited to the following, pose additional risk and uncertainty:   •  Manufacturing capacity in China may shift from footwear to other industries with manufacturing margins that are perceived to be higher.  •  Growth in domestic footwear consumption in China could lead to a significant decrease in factory space available for the manufacture of footwear to be exported.  •  Currently, many footwear manufacturers in China are facing labor shortages as migrant workers seek better wages and working conditions in other industries and vocations.As a result of these risks, there can be no assurance that we will not experience reductions in the available production capacity, increases in our manufacturing costs, late deliveries or terminations of our supplier relationships. Furthermore these risks are compounded by the lack of diversification in the geographic location of our foreign sourcing and manufacturing. With almost all of our supply originating in China, a substantial portion of our supply could be at risk in the event of any negative development related to China.Although we believe we could find alternative manufacturing sources for the products that we currently source from China through other third-party manufacturing facilities in China or other countries, we may not be able to locate alternative manufacturers on terms as favorable as our current terms, including pricing, payment terms, manufacturing capacity, quality standards and lead times for delivery. In addition, there is substantial competition in the footwear industry for quality footwear manufacturers. Accordingly, our future results will partly depend on our ability to maintain positive working relationships with, and offer competitive terms to, our foreign manufacturers. If supply issues cause us to beunable to provide products consistent with our standards or manufacture our footwear in a cost and time efficient manner, our customers may cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reductions in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  11  Customer concentration and other trends in customer behavior may lead to a reduction in or loss of sales.Our wholesale customers include national chains, department stores, mass merchandisers, independent retailers, catalogs and online retailers. Several of our customers operate multiple department store divisions. Furthermore, we often sell multiple types of licensed, branded and private-label footwear to these same national chains, mass merchandisers, department stores, independent retailers, catalogs and online retailers. While we believe purchasing decisions in many cases are made independently by the buyers and merchandisers of each of the customers, a decision by a significant customer to decrease the amount of footwear products purchased from us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition or results of operations.In addition, with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, we and our wholesale customers increasingly depend upon a reduced number of key retailers whose bargaining strength is growing. This consolidation may result in the following adverse consequences:·  Our wholesale customers may seek more favorable terms for their purchases of our products, which could limit our ability to raise prices, recoup cost increases or achieve our profit goals.·  The number of stores that carry our products could decline, thereby exposing us to a greater concentration of accounts receivable risk and negatively impacting our brand visibility.We also face the following risks with respect to our customers:·  Our customers could develop in-house brands or utilize a higher mix of private label footwear products, which would negatively impact our sales.·  As we sell our products to customers and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer’s financial condition, the financial difficulties of a customer could cause us to stop doing business with that customer, reduce our business with that customer or be unable to collect from that customer.·  If any of our major wholesale customers experiences a significant downturn in its business or fails to remain committed to our products or brands, then these customers may reduce or discontinue purchases from us.·  Retailers are directly sourcing more of their products directly from manufacturers overseas and reducing their reliance on wholesalers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Foreign currency fluctuations may result in higher costs and decreased gross profits.Although we purchase most of our products from foreign manufacturers in United States dollars and otherwise engage in foreign currency hedging transactions, we cannot ensure that we will not experience cost variations with respect to exchange rate changes. For example, although we purchase footwear made in China using United States dollars, Chinese manufacturers have been increasing their United States dollar prices to compensate for the appreciation of the Chinese currency against the United States dollar. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may also adversely impact third parties who manufacture the Company’s products by making their purchases of raw materials or other production costs more expensive andmore difficult to finance, resulting in higher prices and lower margins for the Company, its distributors and licensees.Additional duties, quotas, tariffs and other trade restrictions may be imposed on our foreign sourced products, adversely affecting our sales and profitability.Our foreign sourced products are subject to duties collected by customs authorities when imported to the United States or other countries. We cannot predict whether additional customs duties, quotas, tariffs, anti-dumping duties, safeguard measures, cargo restrictions or other trade restrictions may be imposed on the importation of our products in the future. Such additional charges may result in increases in the cost of our products and may adversely affect our sales and profitability.Our business, sales and brand value could be harmed by violations of labor, trade or other laws. We focus on doing business with those suppliers who share our commitment to responsible business practices and the principles set forth in our Production Code of Conduct (the “PCOC”). By requiring our suppliers to comply with the PCOC, we encourage our suppliers to promote best practices and work towards continual improvement throughout their production operations. The PCOC sets forth standards for working conditions and other matters, including compliance with applicable labor practices, workplace environment and compliance with laws. Although we promote ethical business practices, we do not control our suppliers or their labor practices. A failure by any of our suppliers to adhere to these standardsor laws could cause us to incur additional costs for our products, could cause negative publicity and harm our business and reputation. We also require our suppliers to meet our standards for product safety, including compliance with applicable laws and standards with respect to safety issues, including lead content in paint. A failure by any of our suppliers to adhere to product safety standards could lead to a product recall, which could result in critical media coverage, harm our business and reputation and cause us to incur additional costs.  12  In addition, if we, or our suppliers or foreign manufacturers, violate United States or foreign trade laws or regulations, we may be subject to additional duties, significant monetary penalties, the seizure and forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import or the loss of our import privileges. Possible violations of United States or foreign laws or regulations could include inadequate record keeping of our imported products, misstatements or errors as to the origin, classification, marketing or valuation of our imported products, fraudulent visas or labor violations. The effects of these factors could render our conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical and have a negativeimpact on our operating results.We face additional risks relating to operating manufacturing facilities in China.We operate manufacturing facilities in China. These manufacturing facilities are subject to many of the same risks as our third-party foreign sourcing arrangements, described above, but we may be more directly impacted by any negative developments in China with respect to our manufacturing facilities. Our operations in China and, consequently, our ability to deliver products on time and on terms satisfactory to us may be subject to risks such as the following:· inflation or changes in political and economic conditions;· unstable regulatory environments;· changes in import and export duties;· domestic and foreign customs and tariffs;· potentially adverse tax consequences;· trade restrictions;· possible expropriation and nationalization;· restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of China;· labor unrest and/or shortages; and· logistical and communications challenges.In addition, we lease the land on which these Chinese manufacturing facilities are located from the Chinese government through land use rights agreements. Although we believe that we have a positive relationship with the Chinese government, if the Chinese government decided to terminate our land use rights agreements, our ability to fulfill our customers’ orders may be negatively impacted. These risks may have an adverse effect on our Chinese manufacturing operations and our overall business and results of operations.We are reliant upon our information technology systems, and any major disruption of these systems could adversely impact our reputation and our ability to effectively operate our business.Our computer network and systems are essential to all aspects of our operations, including design, pricing, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution. Our ability to manage and maintain our inventory and to deliver products in a timely manner depends on these systems. If any of these systems fails to operate as expected, we experience problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security occurs, we may experience delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency in our operations or be required to expend significant capital to correct the problem, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financialcondition.We have converted certain of our existing applications to an integrated enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system provided by third-party vendors. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we went live on our new ERP system. The operation of this new system carries various risks and uncertainties, including the risk that we will be unable to use the system as expected to successfully execute our strategies and operate our business in a time and cost efficient manner. Future unforeseen issues, interruptions and costs related to our ERP system or any new technology system may cause additional delays or inefficiencies.We may fail to protect the integrity and security of consumer and associate information.We routinely possess sensitive consumer and associate information, and we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect that information. However, hackers and data thieves operate sophisticated, large scale attacks that could result in a breach of our security. In addition, we are required to comply with increasingly complex regulations designed to protect our business and personal data. Any breach of our network security or failure to comply with applicable regulations may result in (a) the loss of valuable business data and/or our consumers’ or associates’ personal information, (b) increased costs associated with implementing additional protections and processes, (c) a disruption of ourbusiness and a loss of sales, (d) negative media attention, (e) damage to our consumer and associate relationships and reputation, and (f) fines or lawsuits.  13  Our success depends on our ability to retain senior management and recruit and retain other key associates.Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified management, administrative, product development and sales personnel to support existing operations and future growth. In addition, our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses often depends on our ability to retain incumbent personnel, many of whom possess valuable institutional knowledge and operating experience. Competition for qualified personnel in the footwear industry is intense, and we compete for these individuals with other companies that in many cases have superior financial and other resources. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management, the inability to attract and retain other qualifiedpersonnel or the inability to effectively transition senior management positions could adversely affect the sales, design and production of our products as well as the implementation of our strategic initiatives.Our reputation and competitive position are dependent on our ability to license well-recognized brands, license our own brands under successful licensing arrangements and protect our intellectual property rights.Licenses – Company as LicenseeAlthough we own many of our wholesale brands, we also rely on our ability to attract and retain licensors that have strong, well-recognized brands and trademarks. Our license agreements are generally for an initial term of two to four years, subject to renewal, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew these licenses. Even our longer-term or renewable licenses are typically dependent upon our ability to market and sell the licensed products at specified levels, and the failure to meet such levels may result in the termination or non-renewal of such licenses. Furthermore, many of our license agreements require minimum royalty payments, and if we are unable to generate sufficient sales andprofitability to cover these minimum royalty requirements, we may be required to make additional payments to the licensors that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, because certain of our license agreements are non-exclusive, new or existing competitors may obtain licenses with overlapping product or geographic terms, resulting in increased competition for a particular market.Licenses – Company as LicensorWe have entered into numerous license agreements with respect to the brands and trademarks that we own. While we have significant control over our licensees’ products and advertising, we generally cannot control their operational and financial issues. If our licensees are not able to meet annual sales and royalty goals, obtain financing, manage their supply chain, control quality and maintain positive relationships with their customers, our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected. While we would likely have the ability to terminate an underperforming license, it may be difficult and costly to locate an acceptable substitute distributor or licensee, and we mayexperience a disruption in our sales and brand visibility. In addition, although many of our license agreements prohibit the licensees from entering into licensing arrangements with certain of our competitors, they are generally not prohibited from offering, under other brands, the types of products covered by their license agreements with us.TrademarksWe believe that our trademarks and trade names are important to our success and competitive position because our distinctive marks create a market for our products and distinguish our products from other products. We cannot, however, guarantee that we will be able to secure protection for our intellectual property in the future or that such protection will be adequate for future operations. Furthermore, we face the risk of ineffective protection of intellectual property rights in jurisdictions where we source and distribute our products, some of which do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States. If we are unsuccessful in challenging a party’s products on the basis ofinfringement of our intellectual property rights, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales, devalue our brands and result in a shift in consumer preference away from our products. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition could be adversely affected.Our retail business depends on our ability to secure affordable and desirable leased locations without creating a competitive concentration of stores.Our Famous Footwear and Specialty Retail segments operate leased retail footwear stores. Accordingly, the success of our retail business depends, in part, on our ability to secure affordable, long-term leases in desirable locations and to secure renewals of such leases. No assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully negotiate lease renewals for existing stores or obtain acceptable terms for new stores in desirable locations. In addition, opening new Famous Footwear stores in our existing markets may result in reduced net sales in existing stores as our stores become more concentrated in the markets we serve. As a result, the number of consumers and financial performance of individual stores maydecline and the average sales per square foot at our stores may be reduced.A disruption in the effective functioning of our distribution centers could adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis.We currently utilize several distribution centers, which are owned, leased or third-party managed. These distribution centers serve as the source of replenishment of inventory for our footwear stores operated by our Famous Footwear and Specialty Retail segments and serve our Wholesale Operations segment. We may be unable to successfully manage, negotiate or renew our third-party distribution center agreements, or we may experience complications with respect to our distribution centers, such as substantial damage to or destruction of such facilities. In such an event, our other distribution centers may not be able to support the resulting additional distribution demands and we may be unable to locate alternativepersons or entities capable of fulfilling our distribution needs, resulting in an adverse effect on our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis. While we maintain business interruption insurance, it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects caused by significant disruptions in our distribution centers.   14  If we are unable to maintain working relationships with our major branded suppliers, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted.Our Famous Footwear segment purchases a substantial portion of its footwear products from major branded suppliers. As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our suppliers. In addition, the success of our financial performance is dependent on the ability of Famous Footwear to obtain products from our suppliers on a timely basis and on acceptable terms. While we believe our relationships with our current suppliers are good, the loss of any of our major suppliers or product developed exclusively for Famous Footwear could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, negative trends in global economic conditions may adverselyimpact our suppliers. If these third-parties do not perform their obligations or are unable to provide us with the materials and services we need at prices and terms that are acceptable to us, our ability to meet our consumers’ demand could be adversely affected.Our quarterly sales and earnings may fluctuate, and securities analysts may not accurately estimate our financial results, which may result in volatility in, or a decline in, our stock price.Our quarterly sales and earnings can vary due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:·  Our Famous Footwear retail business is seasonally weighted to the back-to-school season, which falls in our third fiscal quarter. As a result, the success of our back-to-school offering, which is affected by our ability to anticipate consumer demand and fashion trends, could have a disproportionate impact on our full year results.·  In our wholesale business, sales of footwear are dependent on orders from our major customers, and they may change delivery schedules, change the mix of products they order or cancel orders without penalty.·  Our wholesale customers set the delivery schedule for shipments of our products, which could cause shifts of sales between quarters. Our estimated annual tax rate is based on projections of our domestic and international operating results for the year, which we review and revise as necessary each quarter.·  Our earnings are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, changes in product sales mix, geographic sales trends, consumer sentiment and currency exchange rate fluctuations.As a result of these specific and other general factors, our operating results will vary from quarter to quarter, and the results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year. Any shortfall in sales or earnings from the levels expected by investors or securities analysts could cause a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.In addition, various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include information about our historical financial results as well as the analysts’ estimates of our future performance. The analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline.Changes in tax laws, policies and treaties could result in higher taxes, lower profitability and increased volatility in our financial results.Our financial results are significantly impacted by our effective tax rates, for both domestic and international operations. Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by factors such as changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in permitted deductions, changes in tax laws, interpretations, policies and treaties, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions and any repatriation of earnings from our international operations. The occurrence of such events may result in higher taxes, lower profitability and increased volatility in our financial results.Transitional challenges with acquisitions and/or joint ventures could result in unexpected expenditures of time and resources.Periodically, we pursue acquisitions of other companies or businesses and/or joint ventures. Although we review the records of acquisition candidates, the review may not reveal all existing or potential problems. As a result, we may not accurately assess the value of the business and may, accordingly, ultimately assume unknown adverse operating conditions and/or unanticipated liabilities. In addition, the business may not perform as well as expected. We face the risk that the returns on acquisitions and/or joint ventures will not support the expenditures or indebtedness incurred to acquire or launch such businesses. We also face the risk that we will not be able to integrate acquisitions and/or joint ventures intoour existing operations effectively without substantial expense, delay or other operational or financial problems. Integration may be hindered by, among other things, differing procedures, including internal controls, business practices and technology systems. We may need to allocate more management resources to integration than we planned, which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other profitable activities.  15  Our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by the failure of financial institutions to fulfill their commitments under our Credit Agreement.Our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which matures on January 7, 2016, is provided by a syndicate of financial institutions, with each institution agreeing severally (and not jointly) to make revolving credit loans to us in an aggregate amount of up to $530.0 million in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for up to an additional $150.0 million of optional availability pursuant to a provision commonly referred to as an “accordion feature.” If one or more of the financial institutions participating in the senior secured revolving credit facility were to default on its obligation to fund itscommitment, the portion of the facility provided by such defaulting financial institution might not be available to us.If we are unable to maintain our credit rating, our ability to access capital and interest rates may be negatively impacted.The credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to long-term funding or cause such access to be available at a higher borrowing cost for our operations. We are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. If our ability to access capital becomes constrained, our interest expense will likely increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We may be unable to gain the expected efficiencies from our key strategic initiatives.In 2011, we conducted a review of our portfolio to identify and take action around businesses that either do not fit our target consumer platforms – family, healthy living and contemporary fashion – or that are underperforming. As a result of this review, we announced that we would be exiting certain unprofitable portions of our business, closing certain stores and making other infrastructure changes. We continue to take actions to respond to this review in an effort to focus on our target consumer platforms, maximize operating efficiency and shareholder value and reduce costs. Achievement of our strategic goals depends in part on our ability to identify, develop and execute initiatives appropriatelyand effectively. There can be no assurance that we will gain the expected efficiencies from our strategic initiatives within a targeted timeframe or within targeted costs.Our ability to grow in the future depends upon, among other things, the continued success of our efforts to maintain our brand image and expand our footwear offerings and retail and wholesale distribution channels. As our business grows, we may need to improve and enhance our overall financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures to effectively manage our growth. We may be unable to successfully implement our current growth strategy or other growth strategies or effectively manage our growth, any of which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in the unexpected expenditure of time and resources.We are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions (including environmental matters) relating to our business and to our past operations. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are expensive and will require that we devote substantial resources and executive time to defend, thereby diverting management’s attention and resources that are needed tosuccessfully run our business. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for further discussion of pending matters.Rising insurance costs could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We self-insure a significant portion of our expected losses under our workers’ compensation, employment practices, health, disability, cyber risk, general liability, automobile and property programs, among others. The liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are estimated by considering our historical claims experience and data from actuarial sources. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be affected if claims differ from the assumptions used and historical trends. Unanticipated changes in the estimates underlying our reserves for these losses, such as claims experience, inflation and regulatory changes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition andresults of operations.During 2010, Congress enacted comprehensive health care reform legislation which, among other things, includes guaranteed coverage requirements, eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions and annual lifetime maximum limits, restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded and imposes new and significant taxes on healthy insurers and health care benefits. Possible adverse effects of the health reform legislation include increased costs, exposure to expanded liability and requirements for us to revise ways in which we conduct business.  16  We are subject to legislative or regulatory initiatives related to global warming/climate change concerns, which could negatively affect our business.There has been an increasing focus and debate on global climate change, including increased attention from regulatory agencies and legislative bodies. This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an unspecified array of environmental matters. Legislative, regulatory or other efforts to globally combat climate change could have negative implications, including, but not limited to, future tax increases, increased costs of transportation and utilities and other cost increases imposed on foreign sources of production, all of which could decrease our operating earnings. We are unable to predict the potential effects that any such future initiatives may have on our business"
10,CAL,CALERES INC,2011-04-01,"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORSEconomic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with whom we do business to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.During 2008 and 2009, worldwide economic conditions deteriorated in many countries and regions, including the United States. Despite some positive trends during the second half of 2009 and throughout 2010, business conditions may remain difficult for the foreseeable future. Consumer spending is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, health care costs, currency exchange rates, taxation, gasoline prices, real estate values, foreclosure rates, unemployment trends, economic consequences of military action or terrorist activities and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. Many of these factors are outside of our control and may have a negative impact on our sales and margins. Our customers’ purchases, including our products, could decline during periods when disposable income is lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions. If we encounter increases in our product costs, these may not be offset by comparable rises in the income of consumers of our products. These consumers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or purchase lower-priced products of our competitors in response to higher prices for our products or may choose not to purchase our products at prices that reflect our price increases that become effective from time to time. If any of these events occur, or if unfavorable economic conditions further challenge the consumer environment, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.In addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, product suppliers, insurers, logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities and derivatives transactions. Our customers may experience diminished liquidity that could result in an increase in our credit risk, or our customers may encounter an inability to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products. If third parties on which we rely for goods or services are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in worldwide economic conditions and provide us with the materials and services we need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities or derivatives transactions do not perform their obligations, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected. For example, over the last few years, we experienced some disruption in product sourcing as a result of certain unforeseen factory closures. While the financial consequences to the Company of these closures were not material, the impact of many closures of major facilities may have an adverse effect on product sourcing. We attempt to mitigate this risk in a variety of ways, including diversification among factories, but such risk to our business and results of operations cannot be completely eliminated.We face risks relating to competition.Competition is intense in the footwear industry. Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater financial, marketing and technological resources than we do. In addition, there are low barriers of entry into this industry and new companies may enter the markets in which we compete, further increasing competition in the industry. Our success depends upon our ability to remain competitive in the areas of style, price, quality, location and service, among others, and in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing merchandise and fashion trends and consumer preferences and demands in a timely manner. The industry has also been impacted by retailers aggressively competing on the basis of price. Accordingly, there has been competitive pressure on us to keep our selling prices low. Additionally, retailers are increasingly relying on private label brands, which compete with our products directly. Further, these retailers, in some cases, are deciding to source more of their products directly from manufacturers overseas, reducing their reliance on wholesalers. If we are unable to respond effectively to these competitive pressures, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.We face risks related to the maintenance of proper inventory levels.We place orders with manufacturers for some of our products prior to the time we receive all of our customers’ orders. We do this to minimize purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non-delivery. We also maintain an inventory of certain products that we anticipate will be in greater demand. We may fail to gauge the fashion tastes of consumers or differentiate our retail and wholesale offerings. Also, current economic conditions make it increasingly difficult for us and our customers to accurately forecast product demand trends, and we may be unable to sell the products we have ordered in advance from manufacturers or that we have in our inventory. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair the brand image and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply the quality products that we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships, negatively impact our sales results and diminish brand awareness.  14  BROWN SHOE COMPANY, INC.2010 FORM 10-KWe face risks relating to changes in consumer preferences.The footwear industry is subject to rapidly changing consumer demands and fashion trends. Accordingly, our success in both our wholesale and retail operations depends in large part on our ability to anticipate, understand and react to changing consumer demands. Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change. The success of our products, merchandising strategies and marketing strategies and programs will also depend on a favorable reception by our customers. Furthermore, consumer preferences and purchasing patterns may be influenced by consumers’ disposable income, which could impact the success of our operations.We rely on foreign sources of production.GeneralWe rely almost entirely on foreign sourcing for our footwear products. We source footwear products from independent third-party manufacturing facilities located in China and, to a much lesser extent, Brazil and other countries. At times, we are a major customer of these third-party manufacturing facilities. However, there is substantial competition in the footwear industry for quality footwear manufacturers. Accordingly, our future results will partly depend on maintaining close working relationships with our principal manufacturers.As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our independent third-party foreign manufacturers. We cannot ensure that we will not experience difficulties with such manufacturers, including reduction in the availability of production capacity, failure to meet production deadlines, increases in manufacturing costs or failure to meet our quality standards. Foreign manufacturing is subject to a number of risks, including work stoppages, political instability, expropriation, nationalization, foreign currency fluctuations, changing economic conditions, the imposition of tariffs, import and export controls and other non-tariff barriers and changes in governmental policies or climate change legislation. These risks, as well as other factors outside of our control, such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems, could disrupt the manufacturing process and timeliness of merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales, order cancellations or excessive markdowns, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We require our third-party foreign manufacturers to meet our standards and footwear-industry standards for working conditions and other matters, including compliance with applicable labor, environmental and other laws, before we place orders with them to manufacture products for us. A failure by any of our third-party manufacturers to adhere to these standards or laws could cause us to incur additional costs for our products and could cause negative publicity and harm our business and reputation. We also require our third-party foreign manufacturers to meet our and industry standards for product safety, including compliance with applicable laws and standards with respect to lead content in paint and other safety issues. A failure by any of our third-party manufacturers to adhere to product safety standards could lead to a product recall, which could result in critical media coverage and harm our business and reputation and could cause us to incur additional costs.We cannot predict whether additional United States or foreign customs quotas, duties, taxes or other changes or restrictions will be imposed upon the importation of foreign produced products in the future or what effect such actions could have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Furthermore, our products depend on the availability of leather and other raw materials. Any significant shortage of quantities or increases in the cost of leather or other materials or resources used to produce our products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.ChinaWe rely heavily on manufacturing facilities located in China. Historically, the trade relationship between the United States and China has not had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. There have been, however, and may in the future be, threats to the trade relationships between the United States and China. There can be no assurance that the trade relationship between the United States and China will not worsen, and if it does worsen, that our financial condition or results of operations will not be materially adversely affected thereby.  15  BROWN SHOE COMPANY, INC.2010 FORM 10-KWe cannot predict the effect that changes in the economic and political conditions in the United States and China could have on the economics of doing business with Chinese manufacturers. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:·  manufacturing capacity in China may shift from footwear to other industries with manufacturing margins that are perceived to be higher;·  growth in domestic footwear consumption in China could lead to a significant decrease in factory space available for the manufacture of footwear to be exported; and·  currently, many footwear manufacturers in China are facing labor shortages as migrant workers seek better wages and working conditions in other industries and vocations.Any of the conditions described above, including the continuation of certain trends identified, could adversely affect our current manufacturers’ operations and the ability to source footwear from these manufacturers, and we may experience difficulties or delays in sourcing our footwear as well as higher footwear costs.Although we believe we could find alternative manufacturing sources for those products we currently source from China through independent third-party manufacturing facilities in other countries, the loss of a substantial portion of our Chinese manufacturing capacity would have a material adverse effect on the Company. For example, alternative manufacturers may have higher prices, less favorable payment terms, less manufacturing capacity, lower quality standards or increased lead times for delivery. If we are unable to provide products consistent with our standards or the manufacture of our footwear is delayed or becomes more expensive, this could result in our customers canceling orders, refusing to accept deliveries or demanding reductions in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, the occurrence of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake or hurricane, the outbreak of a pandemic disease in China or any other disaster, such as that caused by a nuclear meltdown in which radioactive material is released into the environment, would severely interfere with the manufacture of our products and have a material adverse effect on the Company.CurrencyAlthough we purchase most products from foreign manufacturers in United States dollars and otherwise engage in foreign currency hedging transactions, we cannot ensure that we will not experience cost variations with respect to exchange rate changes. For example, although we purchase footwear made in China using United States dollars, recently Chinese manufacturers have been increasing their United States dollar prices to compensate for the appreciation of the Chinese currency against the United States dollar.We face risks relating to operating newly acquired manufacturing facilities in China.Our acquisition of ASG on February 17, 2011, included manufacturing facilities in China that are now owned and operated by Brown Shoe. Although these facilities account for only a portion of total production of performance athletic footwear and outdoor brands acquired from ASG, these manufacturing operations are subject to a number of potential risks. Such risks include, among others:·  inflation or changes in political and economic conditions;·  unstable regulatory environments;·  changes in import and export duties;·  domestic and foreign customs and tariffs;·  potentially adverse tax consequences;·  trade restrictions;·  restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of China;·  labor unrest and/or shortages; and·  logistical and communications challenges.These risks may have an adverse effect on our Chinese manufacturing operations and on our overall business and results of operations.We lease the land where our Chinese manufacturing facilities are located from the Chinese government through land use rights agreements. Although we believe our relationship with the Chinese government is good, if the Chinese government decided to terminate our land use rights agreements, our assets could become impaired, and our ability to meet our customers’ orders could be impacted. This could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  16  BROWN SHOE COMPANY, INC.2010 FORM 10-KWe face risks relating to customer concentration in our wholesale business.Our wholesale customers include national chains, mass merchandisers, department stores, independent retailers, catalogs and online retailers. Several of our customers operate multiple department store divisions. Furthermore, we often sell multiple types of licensed, branded and private-label footwear to these same national chains, mass merchandisers, department stores, independent retailers, catalogs and online retailers. While we believe purchasing decisions in many cases are made independently by the buyers and merchandisers of each of the customers, a decision by a significant customer, including any multiple national chain operators, mass merchandiser, department store, independent retailer, catalog and/or online retailer or any other significant customer, to decrease the amount of footwear products purchased from us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.The retail industry has experienced increased consolidation. As this trend continues, our wholesale customers will likely seek more favorable terms for their purchases of our products, which could limit our ability to raise prices or achieve our profit goals. In turn, we may not be able to recoup raw material or other cost increases. Sales on terms less favorable to us than our current terms will have an adverse effect on our profitability. Consolidation could lead to a decrease in the number of stores that carry our products and could expose us to greater concentration of accounts receivable risk. In addition, retailers are deciding to source more of their products directly from manufacturers overseas and reducing their reliance on wholesalers. If retailers continue to increase their direct sourcing of footwear from overseas, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We are dependent on our information technology systems.Our computer network and systems are essential to all aspects of our operations. If there were to be a major disruption of our information technology operations, we believe that we would be able to recover necessary information, but we do not have complete assurance that we would be able to do so. Further, we do not have complete assurance that we would be able to repair our systems to allow us to continue operations without significant business interruption. If a disruption is of a nature that delays or prohibits implementation of recovery arrangements, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.To support our business strategy while streamlining and transforming day-to-day operations for our integrated business model, we converted certain of our existing internally developed and certain other third-party applications to an integrated enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) information technology system provided by third-party vendors. While we believe the implementation of these systems provides significant opportunity for us, such a major undertaking carries various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These include: (i) changes in the anticipated benefits of strategic business transformation; (ii) our ability to utilize our new information technology system and perform our business processes as designed to successfully execute our strategies; and (iii) the additional risk of future unforeseen issues, interruptions and costs. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we went live on the wholesale portion of our new ERP system, and experienced some delays in the financial statement closing process and timely access to key information used to monitor our business. While we are addressing these issues, the timeline for stabilization of the issues experienced and optimization of benefits expected from the implementation of the ERP system are not now determinable. We may fail to protect the integrity and security of customer and associate information.We routinely possess sensitive customer and associate information and, while we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect that information, if our security procedures and controls were compromised, it could harm our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition and may increase the costs we incur to protect against such information security breaches, such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with consumer protection laws and costs resulting from consumer fraud.  We depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively and may be unable to retain senior management and recruit and retain other key associates.Our success depends on the ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified management, administrative, product development and sales personnel to support existing operations and future growth. Competition for qualified personnel in the footwear industry is intense, and we compete for these individuals with other companies that in many cases have substantial financial and other resources. The loss of the services of any members of senior management, the inability to attract and retain other qualified personnel, or the inability to effectively transition senior management positions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may also be unable to retain key management personnel in businesses that we acquire.   17  BROWN SHOE COMPANY, INC.2010 FORM 10-KWe face risks relating to our licensed and owned intellectual property.LicensesThe success of our Wholesale Operations segment to date has been due, in part, to our ability to attract and retain licensors that have strong, well-recognized brands and trademarks. Our license agreements are generally for an initial term of two to four years, subject to renewal, but even where we have longer-term licenses or have an option to renew a license, such agreements are dependent upon our achieving certain results in marketing the licensed products. While we believe we will generally be able to decide whether to renew our existing licenses and obtain new licenses in the future, there can be no assurance we will be able to renew our current licenses or obtain new licenses. In addition, certain of our license agreements are not exclusive, and new or existing competitors may obtain similar licenses. Many of our license agreements require minimum royalty payments. Our ability to generate sufficient sales and profitability to cover these minimum royalty requirements is not guaranteed, and if sales of such products are not sufficient to generate these minimum payments, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.TrademarksWe believe that our trademarks and trade names are important to our business and are generally sufficient to permit us to carry on our business as presently conducted and planned. We cannot, however, know whether we will be able to secure protection for our intellectual property in the future or if that protection will be adequate for future operations. Furthermore, we face the risk of ineffective protection of intellectual property rights in jurisdictions where we source and distribute our products. We also cannot be certain that our activities do not infringe on the proprietary rights of others. If we are compelled to prosecute infringing parties, defend our intellectual property or defend ourselves from intellectual property claims made by others, we may face significant expenses and liability.We are dependent on leased locations.Our Famous Footwear and Specialty Retail segments operate footwear stores. We lease all of these stores. Accordingly, the success of our operations, in part, is dependent on our ability to secure affordable, long-term leases in desirable locations and to secure renewals of such leases. Although we believe that most of our current leases can be renewed on acceptable terms, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully negotiate lease renewals on existing stores or to obtain acceptable terms for new stores in desirable locations, and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and our financial condition and results of operations.We are dependent on distribution centers.We currently use six distribution centers, which serve as the source of replenishment of inventory for our footwear stores operated by our Famous Footwear and Specialty Retail segments and serve our Wholesale Operations segment. If complications arise with certain of our operating distribution centers or these distribution centers are severely damaged or destroyed, our other distribution centers may not be able to support the resulting additional distribution demands and we may be unable to locate alternative persons or entities capable of doing so. This may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis, which could adversely affect our results of operations.We are dependent on major branded suppliers.Our Famous Footwear retail chain purchases a substantial portion of its footwear products from major branded suppliers. While we believe our relationships with our current suppliers are good, the loss of any of our major suppliers or product developed exclusively for Famous Footwear could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our suppliers. In addition, the success of our financial performance is dependent on the ability of Famous Footwear to obtain products from its suppliers on a timely basis and on acceptable terms.We face risks that our quarterly sales and earnings may fluctuate, which may result in volatility in our stock price.Our quarterly sales and earnings can vary due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales and earnings. In our wholesale business, sales of footwear are dependent on orders from our major customers, and they may change delivery schedules, change the mix of products they order or cancel orders without penalty. In addition, our wholesale customers set the delivery schedule for shipments of our products, which could cause shifts of sales between quarters. Our Famous Footwear retail business is seasonally weighted to the back-to-school season, which falls into our fiscal third quarter. In addition, our annualized tax rate is based on projections of our domestic and international operating results for the year, which we review and revise as necessary each quarter. As a result of these specific and other general factors, our operating results will vary from quarter to quarter, and the results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year. Any shortfall in sales or earnings from the levels expected by investors or securities analysts could cause a decrease in the trading price of our stock.   18  BROWN SHOE COMPANY, INC.2010 FORM 10-KWe could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, policies and treaties.Our financial results are significantly impacted by our effective tax rates, for both domestic and international operations; therefore, changes in domestic and/or international tax laws, interpretations, policies and treaties may result in increased volatility of our financial results. The passage of any currently existing or future legislation, as a result of changes in domestic or international tax laws, that defers or eliminates certain tax deductions that are currently available to the Company would result in the Company paying higher income taxes and, depending on the specifics of the changes, could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may face transitional challenges with acquisitions and/or joint ventures.Periodically, we pursue acquisitions of other companies or businesses and/or joint ventures. Although we review the records of acquisition candidates, such an in-depth review of the records may not reveal existing or potential problems. As a result, we may not become familiar enough with the business to fully assess its strengths and weaknesses, and accordingly, we may assume adverse operating conditions and/or unanticipated liabilities, and the business may not perform as well as expected. We face the risk that the returns on acquisitions and/or joint ventures will not support the expenditures or indebtedness incurred to acquire or launch such businesses. We also face the risk that we will not be able to integrate acquisitions and/or joint ventures into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense, delay or other operational or financial problems. Integration may be hindered by, among other things, differing procedures, including internal controls, business practices and technology systems. We may need to allocate more management resources to integration than we planned, which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other profitable activities.With our recent acquisition of ASG, we have expanded our presence in the highly competitive performance footwear market.Our acquisition of ASG added performance athletic and outdoor footwear brands to our existing wholesale portfolio of brands, strengthening our position in the performance footwear market. The performance footwear market is highly competitive in the United States and worldwide, and market participants face many challenges. Consumer perceptions of our newly acquired performance footwear brands, competitive product offerings and technologies, rapid changes in footwear technology and consumer preferences, any negative professional and expert opinions on the unique technologies and designs of the newly acquired performance footwear brands and performance claims that may arise and any negative publicity and media attention associated with this product category that may arise may constitute significant risk factors in our operations and may negatively impact our business.We could be adversely affected by the failure of financial institutions to fulfill their commitments under our Credit Agreement. Our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which matures on January 7, 2016, is provided by a syndicate of financial institutions, with each institution agreeing severally (and not jointly) to make revolving credit loans to us in an aggregate amount of up to $530.0 million in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for up to an additional $150.0 million of optional availability pursuant to a provision commonly referred to as an “accordion feature”. If one or more of the financial institutions participating in the senior secured revolving credit facility were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment, the portion of the facility provided by such defaulting financial institution would not be available to us. We may be unable to maintain our credit rating, thus negatively affecting our ability to access capital and increasing our interest expense.The credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to long-term funding or cause such access to be available at a higher borrowing cost for our operations. We are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive. If our ability to access capital becomes constrained, our interest costs will likely increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings.We are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions (including environmental matters) relating to our business and to our past operations. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are expensive and will require that we devote substantial resources and executive time to defend the Company. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for further discussion of pending matters.   19  BROWN SHOE COMPANY, INC.2010 FORM 10-KWe are subject to rising insurance costs.We self-insure a significant portion of our expected losses under our workers’ compensation, employment practices, health, disability, cyber risk, general liability, automobile and property programs, among others. The liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are estimated by considering our historical claims experience and data from actuarial sources. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be affected if claims differ from the assumptions used and historical trends. Unanticipated changes in the estimates underlying our reserves for these losses, such as claims experience, inflation and regulatory changes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to legislative or regulatory initiatives related to global warming/climate change concerns, which could negatively affect our business.There has been an increasing focus and continuous debate on global climate change, including increased attention from regulatory agencies and legislative bodies globally. This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an unspecified array of environmental matters. Legislative, regulatory or other efforts globally to combat climate change could have negative implications, including, but not limited to, future tax increases, increased costs of transportation and utilities and other cost increases imposed on foreign sources of production, all of which could decrease our operating profits. We are unable to predict the potential effects that any such future environmental initiatives may have on our business. "
5,CAL,CALERES INC,2010-03-31,"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORSCertain statements in this Form 10-K, as well as other statements made by us from time to time, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ materially. The considerations listed below represent certain important factors we believe could cause such results to differ. These considerations are not intended to represent a complete list of the general or specific risks that may affect the Company. It should be recognized that other risk factors (including those described in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) may be significant, presently or in the future, and the risks set forth below may affect us to a greater extent than indicated. We disclaim any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements.Economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.During 2008 and 2009, worldwide economic conditions deteriorated in many countries and regions, including the United States. Despite more positive trends during the second half of 2009, business conditions may remain difficult for the foreseeable future. Consumer spending is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, healthcare costs, currency exchange rates, taxation, gasoline prices, real estate values, foreclosure rates, unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. Many of these factors are outside of our control and may have a negative impact on our sales and margins. Our customers’ purchases, including our products, could decline during periods when disposable income is lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions. If we encounter increases in our product costs, these may not be offset by comparable rises in the income of consumers of our products. These consumers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or lower-priced products of our competitors in response to higher prices for our products or may choose not to purchase our products at prices that reflect our price increases that become effective from time to time. If any of these events occur, or if unfavorable economic conditions further challenge the consumer environment, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.In addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, product suppliers, insurers, logistics and other service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our credit facilities and derivatives transactions. Our customers may experience diminished liquidity that could result in an increase in our credit risk, or our customers may encounter an inability to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products. If third parties on which we rely for goods or services are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in worldwide economic conditions and provide us with the materials and services we need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities or derivatives transactions do not perform their obligations, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected. For example, over the last two years, we experienced some disruption in product sourcing as a result of certain unforeseen factory closures. While the financial consequences to the Company of these closures were not material, the impact of many closures of major facilities may have an adverse effect on product sourcing. We attempt to mitigate this risk in a variety of ways, including diversification among factories, but such risk to our business and results of operations cannot be completely eliminated.We face risks relating to competition.Competition is intense in the footwear industry. Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater financial, marketing and technological resources than we do. In addition, there are low barriers of entry into this industry and new companies may enter the markets in which we compete, further increasing competition in the industry. Our success depends upon our ability to remain competitive in the areas of style, price, quality, location and service, among others, and in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing merchandise and fashion trends and consumer preferences and demands in a timely manner. The industry has also been impacted by retailers aggressively competing on the basis of price. Accordingly, there has been competitive pressure on us to keep our selling prices low. If we are unable to respond effectively to these competitive pressures, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.  12  BROWN SHOE COMPANY, INC.2009 FORM 10-KWe face risks related to the maintenance of proper inventory levels.We place orders with manufacturers for some of our products prior to the time we receive all of our customers’ orders. We do this to minimize purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non-delivery. We also maintain an inventory of certain products that we anticipate will be in greater demand. We may fail to gauge the fashion tastes of consumers or differentiate our retail and wholesale offerings. However, current economic conditions make it increasingly difficult for us and our customers to accurately forecast product demand trends, and we may be unable to sell the products we have ordered in advance from manufacturers or that we have in our inventory. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair the brand image and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply the quality products that we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships, negatively impact our sales results and diminish brand awareness.We face risks relating to changes in consumer preferences.The footwear industry is subject to rapidly changing consumer demands and fashion trends. Accordingly, our success in both our wholesale and retail operations depends in large part on our ability to anticipate, understand and react to changing consumer demands. Our products must appeal to a broad range of consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to rapid change. The success of our products, merchandising strategies and marketing strategies and programs will also depend on a favorable reception by our customers. Furthermore, consumer preferences and purchasing patterns may be influenced by consumers’ disposable income, which could impact the success of our operations.We rely on foreign sources of production.GeneralWe rely almost entirely on foreign sourcing for our footwear products. We source footwear products from independent third-party manufacturing facilities located in China and, to a much lesser extent, Brazil and other countries. At times, we are a major customer of these third-party manufacturing facilities. However, there is substantial competition in the footwear industry for quality footwear manufacturers. Accordingly, our future results will partly depend on maintaining close working relationships with our principal manufacturers.As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our independent third-party foreign manufacturers. We cannot ensure that we will not experience difficulties with such manufacturers, including reduction in the availability of production capacity, failure to meet production deadlines, increases in manufacturing costs or failure to meet our quality standards. Foreign manufacturing is subject to a number of risks, including transportation delays and interruptions, work stoppages, political instability, expropriation, nationalization, foreign currency fluctuations, changing economic conditions, the imposition of tariffs, import and export controls and other non-tariff barriers and changes in governmental policies.We require our third-party foreign manufacturers to meet our standards and footwear-industry standards for working conditions and other matters, including compliance with applicable labor, environmental and other laws, before we place orders with them to manufacture products for us. A failure by any of our third-party manufacturers to adhere to these standards or laws could cause us to incur additional costs for our products and could cause negative publicity and harm our business and reputation. We also require our third-party foreign manufacturers to meet our and industry standards for product safety, including compliance with applicable laws and standards with respect to lead content in paint and other safety issues. A failure by any of our third-party manufacturers to adhere to product safety standards could lead to a product recall, which could result in critical media coverage and harm our business and reputation and could cause us to incur additional costs.We cannot predict whether additional United States or foreign customs quotas, duties, taxes or other changes or restrictions will be imposed upon the importation of foreign produced products in the future or what effect such actions could have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Furthermore, our products depend on the availability of leather and other raw materials. Any significant shortage of quantities or increases in the cost of leather or other materials or resources used to produce our products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  13  BROWN SHOE COMPANY, INC.2009 FORM 10-KChinaWe rely heavily on manufacturing facilities located in China. Historically, the trade relationship between the United States and China has not had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. There have been, however, and may in the future be, threats to the trade relationships between the United States and China. There can be no assurance that the trade relationship between the United States and China will not worsen, and if it does worsen, that our financial condition or results of operations will not be materially adversely affected thereby.We cannot predict the effect that changes in the economic and political conditions in the United States and China could have on the economics of doing business with Chinese manufacturers. For example, manufacturing capacity in China may shift from footwear to other industries with manufacturing margins that are perceived to be higher. Currently, many footwear manufacturers in China are facing labor shortages as migrant workers seek better wages and working conditions in other industries and vocations. If this trend continues, our current manufacturers’ operations could be adversely affected, and we may experience difficulties or delays in sourcing our footwear as well as higher footwear costs.Although we believe we could find alternative manufacturing sources for those products we currently source from China through independent third-party manufacturing facilities in other countries, the loss of a substantial portion of our Chinese manufacturing capacity would have a material adverse effect on the Company. For example, alternative manufacturers may have higher prices, less favorable payment terms, less manufacturing capacity, lower quality standards or increased lead times for delivery. If we are unable to provide products consistent with our standards or the manufacture of our footwear is delayed or becomes more expensive, this could result in our customers canceling orders, refusing to accept deliveries or demanding reductions in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, the occurrence of a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane or the outbreak of a pandemic disease in China would severely interfere with the manufacture of our products and have a material adverse effect on the Company.CurrencyAlthough we purchase most products from foreign manufacturers in United States dollars and otherwise engage in foreign currency hedging transactions, we cannot ensure that we will not experience cost variations with respect to exchange rate changes. For example, although we purchase footwear made in China using United States dollars, recently Chinese manufacturers have been increasing their United States dollar prices to compensate for the appreciation of the Chinese currency against the United States dollar.We face risks relating to customer concentration.Our wholesale customers include national chains, mass merchandisers, department stores, independent retailers, catalogs and online retailers. Several of our customers operate multiple department store divisions. Furthermore, we often sell multiple types of licensed, branded and private-label footwear to these same national chains, mass merchandisers, department stores, independent retailers, catalogs and online retailers. While we believe purchasing decisions in many cases are made independently by the buyers and merchandisers of each of the customers, a decision by our customers who operate multiple national chains, mass merchandisers, department stores, independent retailers, catalogs and/or online retailers or any other significant customer to decrease the amount of footwear products purchased from us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.The retail industry has experienced increased consolidation. As this trend continues, our customers will likely seek more favorable terms for their purchases of our products, which could limit our ability to raise prices or achieve our profit goals. In turn, we may not be able to recoup raw material or other cost increases. Sales on terms less favorable to us than our current terms will have an adverse effect on our profitability. Consolidation could lead to a decrease in the number of stores that carry our products and could expose us to greater concentration of accounts receivable risk. In addition, retailers are deciding to source more of their products directly from manufacturers overseas and reducing their reliance on wholesalers. If retailers continue to increase their direct sourcing of footwear from overseas, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We are dependent on our information technology systems.Our computer network and systems are essential to all aspects of our operations. If there were to be a major disruption of our information technology operations, we believe that we would be able to recover necessary information, but do not have complete assurance that we would be able to do so. Further, we do not have complete assurance that we would be able to repair our systems to allow us to continue operations without significant business interruption. If a disruption is of a nature that delays or prohibits implementation of recovery arrangements, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  14  BROWN SHOE COMPANY, INC.2009 FORM 10-KTo support our business strategy while streamlining and transforming day-to-day operations for our integrated business model, we are converting select existing internally developed and certain other third-party applications to an integrated enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) information technology system provided by third-party vendors. These information technology initiatives began during the summer of 2008 and will continue through 2010. We believe the phased implementation may disrupt not only our information systems, but also a significant portion of our general office operations. While we believe the implementation of these systems will provide significant opportunity for us, such a major undertaking carries various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These include: (i) changes in the estimated costs and anticipated benefits of strategic business transformation; (ii) potential disruption to our business and operations as we implement the ERP applications; (iii) the timing and uncertainty of activities related to software implementation and business transformation; (iv) our ability to utilize our new information technology system to successfully execute our strategies; and (v) the additional risk of unforeseen issues, interruptions and costs. If we are unable to successfully implement these information technology initiatives, it may have an adverse effect on our capital resources, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.We may fail to protect the integrity and security of customer and associate information.We routinely possess sensitive customer and associate information and, while we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect that information, if our security procedures and controls were compromised, it could harm our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition and may increase the costs we incur to protect against such information security breaches, such as increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with consumer protection laws and costs resulting from consumer fraud.  We may be unable to retain senior management and to recruit and retain other key associates.Our success depends on the ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified management, administrative, product development and sales personnel to support existing operations and future growth. Competition for qualified personnel in the footwear industry is intense, and we compete for these individuals with other companies that in many cases have substantial financial and other resources. The loss of the services of any members of senior management or the inability to attract and retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may also be unable to retain key management personnel in businesses that we acquire.We face risks relating to our licensed and owned intellectual property.LicensesThe success of our Wholesale Operations segment has to date been due, in part, to our ability to attract and retain licensors which have strong, well-recognized brands and trademarks. Our license agreements are generally for an initial term of two to four years, subject to renewal, but even where we have longer-term licenses or have an option to renew a license, such agreements are dependent upon our achieving certain results in marketing the licensed products. While we believe we will generally be able to decide whether to renew our existing licenses and obtain new licenses in the future, there can be no assurance we will be able to renew our current licenses or obtain new licenses. In addition, certain of our license agreements are not exclusive, and new or existing competitors may obtain similar licenses.Many of our license agreements require minimum royalty payments. Our ability to generate sufficient sales and profitability to cover these minimum royalty requirements is not guaranteed, and if sales of such products are not sufficient to generate these minimum payments, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.TrademarksWe believe that our trademarks and trade names are important to our business and are generally sufficient to permit us to carry on our business as presently conducted and planned. We cannot, however, know whether we will be able to secure protection for our intellectual property in the future or if that protection will be adequate for future operations. Furthermore, we face the risk of ineffective protection of intellectual property rights in jurisdictions where we source and distribute our products. We also cannot be certain that our activities do not infringe on the proprietary rights of others. If we are compelled to prosecute infringing parties, defend our intellectual property or defend ourselves from intellectual property claims made by others, we may face significant expenses and liability.We are dependent on leased locations.Our Famous Footwear and Specialty Retail segments operate footwear stores. We lease all of these stores. Accordingly, the success of our operations, in part, is dependent on our ability to secure affordable, long-term leases in desirable locations and to secure renewals of such leases. Although we believe that most of our current leases can be renewed on acceptable terms, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully negotiate lease renewals on existing stores or to obtain acceptable terms for new stores in desirable locations, and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and our financial condition and results of operations.  15  BROWN SHOE COMPANY, INC.2009 FORM 10-KWe are dependent on major branded suppliers.Our Famous Footwear retail chain purchases a substantial portion of its footwear products from major branded suppliers. While we believe our relationships with our current suppliers are good, the loss of any of our major suppliers or product developed exclusively for Famous Footwear could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As is common in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with our suppliers. In addition, the success of our financial performance is dependent on the ability of Famous Footwear to obtain products from its suppliers on a timely basis and on acceptable terms.We face risks that our quarterly sales and earnings may fluctuate, which may result in volatility in our stock price.Our quarterly sales and earnings can vary due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales and earnings. In our wholesale business, sales of footwear are dependent on orders from our major customers, and they may change delivery schedules, change the mix of products they order or cancel orders without penalty. In addition, our wholesale customers set the delivery schedule for shipments of our products, which could cause shifts of sales between quarters. Our Famous Footwear retail business is seasonally weighted to the back-to-school season, which falls into our fiscal third quarter. In addition, our annualized tax rate is based on projections of our domestic and international operating results for the year, which we review and revise as necessary each quarter. As a result of these specific and other general factors, our operating results will vary from quarter to quarter, and the results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the full year. Any shortfall in sales or earnings from the levels expected by investors or securities analysts could cause a decrease in the trading price of our stock.We could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, policies and treaties.Our financial results are significantly impacted by our effective tax rates, for both domestic and international operations; therefore, changes in domestic and/or international tax laws, interpretations, policies and treaties may result in increased volatility of our financial results. For example, current policies being contemplated in the United States include proposed legislation that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to United States tax laws, including the elimination of certain key United States federal income tax provisions currently available to the Company as well as other United States multinational companies. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in United States federal income tax laws that defer or eliminate certain tax deductions that are currently available to the Company would result in the Company paying higher federal income taxes and, depending on the specifics of the changes, could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.We may face transitional challenges with acquisitions and/or joint ventures.Periodically, we pursue acquisitions of other companies or businesses and/or joint ventures. Although we review the records of acquisition candidates, such an in-depth review of the records may not reveal existing or potential problems. As a result, we may not become familiar enough with the business to fully assess its strengths and weaknesses, and accordingly, we may assume adverse operating conditions and/or unanticipated liabilities, and the business may not perform as well as expected. We face the risk that the returns on acquisitions and/or joint ventures will not support the expenditures or indebtedness incurred to acquire or launch such businesses. We also face the risk that we will not be able to integrate acquisitions and/or joint ventures into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense, delay or other operational or financial problems. Integration may be hindered by, among other things, differing procedures, including internal controls, business practices and technology systems. We may need to allocate more management resources to integration than we planned, which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other profitable activities.We are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings.We are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions (including environmental matters) relating to our business and to our past operations. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are expensive and will require that we devote substantial resources and executive time to defend the Company. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings, for further discussion of pending matters.We are subject to rising insurance costs.We self-insure a significant portion of our expected losses under our workers’ compensation, employment practices, health, disability, cyber risk, general liability, automobile and property programs, among others. The liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are estimated by considering our historical claims experience and data from actuarial sources. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be affected if claims differ from the assumptions used and historical trends. Unanticipated changes in the estimates underlying our reserves for these losses, such as claims experience, inflation and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  16  BROWN SHOE COMPANY, INC.2009 FORM 10-K"

Actual results could differmaterially. The considerations listed below represent certain important factorswe believe could cause such results to differ. These considerations are notintended to represent a complete list of the general or specific risks that mayaffect the Company. It should be recognized that other risk factors (includingthose described in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysisof Financial Condition and Results of Operations) may be significant,presently or in the future, and the risks set forth below may affect us to agreater extent than indicated. We disclaim any intent or obligation to updatethese forward-looking statements.Currenteconomic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce accessto credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to sufferfinancial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results ofoperations, financial condition and cash flows.Worldwideeconomic conditions have recently deteriorated in many countries and regions,including the United States, and may remain depressed for the foreseeablefuture. Consumer spending is affected by many factors, including, among others,general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels,the availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates, taxation, gasolineprices, real estate values, foreclosure rates, unemployment trends and othermatters that influence consumer confidence and spending. Many of these factorsare outside of our control and may have a negative impact on our sales andmargins. Our customers’ purchases, including our products, could decline duringperiods when disposable income is lower, when prices increase in response torising costs or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economicconditions. If we encounter increases in our product costs, these may not beoffset by comparable rises in the income of consumers of our products. Theseconsumers may choose to purchase fewer of our products or lower-priced productsof our competitors in response to higher prices for our products, or may choosenot to purchase our products at prices that reflect our price increases thatbecome effective from time to time. If any of these events occur, or ifunfavorable economic conditions continue to challenge the consumer environment,our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could beadversely affected.Inaddition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may resultin financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidationsand other unfavorable events for our customers, product suppliers, insurers,logistics and other service providers and financial institutions which arecounterparties to our credit facilities and derivatives transactions. Ourcustomers may experience diminished liquidity that could result in an increasein our credit risk, or our customers may encounter an inability to obtain creditto finance purchases of our products. If third parties on which we rely forgoods or services are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from thedeterioration in worldwide economic conditions and provide us with the materialsand services we need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities orderivatives transactions do not perform their obligations, our business, resultsof operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected.For example, we have experienced some disruption in product sourcing as a resultof certain unforeseen factory closures in 2008. While the financial consequencesto the Company of these closures were not material, the impact of many closuresof major facilities may have an adverse effect on product sourcing. We attemptto mitigate this risk in a variety of ways, including diversification amongfactories, but such risk to our business and results of operations cannot becompletely eliminated.Weface risks relating to competition.Competitionis intense in the footwear industry. Certain of our competitors are larger andhave greater financial, marketing and technological resources than we do. Oursuccess depends upon our ability to remain competitive in the areas of style,price, quality, location and service, among others, and in part on our abilityto anticipate and respond to changing merchandise and fashion trends andconsumer preferences and demands in a timely manner. The industry has also beenimpacted by retailers aggressively competing on the basis of price. Accordingly,there has been competitive pressure on us to keep our selling prices low. If weare unable to respond effectively to these competitive pressures, our businessand results of operations may be adversely affected. 12 BROWN      SHOE COMPANY, INC.2008      FORM 10-KWeface risks related to the maintenance of proper inventory levels.We placeorders with manufacturers for some of our products prior to the time we receiveall of our customers’ orders. We do this to minimize purchasing costs, the timenecessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non-delivery. We also maintainan inventory of certain products that we anticipate will be in greater demand.We may fail to gauge the fashion tastes of consumers or differentiate our retailand wholesale offerings. However, the current global economic slowdown makes itincreasingly difficult for us and our customers to accurately forecast productdemand trends, and we may be unable to sell the products we have ordered inadvance from manufacturers or that we have in our inventory. Inventory levels inexcess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs, and the sale ofexcess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair the brand imageand have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financialcondition. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products orif our manufacturers fail to supply the quality products that we require at thetime we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortagesmight delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer and distributorrelationships, negatively impact our sales results and diminish brandawareness.Weface risks relating to changes in consumer preferences.Thefootwear industry is subject to rapidly changing consumer demands and fashiontrends. Accordingly, our success in both our wholesale and retail operationsdepends in large part on our ability to anticipate, understand and react tochanging consumer demands. Our products must appeal to a broad range ofconsumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subjectto rapid change. The success of our products, merchandising strategies andmarketing strategies and programs will also depend on a favorable reception byour customers. Furthermore, consumer preferences and purchasing patterns may beinfluenced by consumers’ disposable income, which could impact the success ofour operations.Werely on foreign sources of production.GeneralWe relyalmost entirely on foreign sourcing for our footwear products. We sourcefootwear products from independent third-party manufacturing facilities locatedin China and, to a lesser extent, Brazil and other countries. Typically, we area major customer of these third-party manufacturing facilities. However, thereis substantial competition in the footwear industry for quality footwearmanufacturers. Accordingly, our future results will partly depend on maintainingclose working relationships with our principal manufacturers.As iscommon in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with ourindependent third-party foreign manufacturers. We cannot ensure that we will notexperience difficulties with such manufacturers, including reduction in theavailability of production capacity, failure to meet production deadlines,increases in manufacturing costs or failure to meet our quality standards.Foreign manufacturing is subject to a number of risks, including transportationdelays and interruptions, work stoppages, political instability, expropriation,nationalization, foreign currency fluctuations, changing economic conditions,the imposition of tariffs, import and export controls and other non-tariffbarriers and changes in governmental policies.Werequire our third-party foreign manufacturers to meet our standards andfootwear-industry standards for working conditions and other matters, includingcompliance with applicable labor, environmental and other laws, before we placeorders with them to manufacture products for us. A failure by any of ourthird-party manufacturers to adhere to these standards or laws could cause us toincur additional costs for our products and could cause negative publicity andharm our business and reputation. We also require our third-party foreignmanufacturers to meet our and industry standards for product safety, includingcompliance with applicable laws and standards with respect to lead content inpaint and other child safety issues. A failure by any of our third-partymanufacturers to adhere to product safety standards could lead to a productrecall, which could result in critical media coverage and harm our business andreputation and could cause us to incur additional costs.We cannotpredict whether additional United States or foreign customs quotas, duties,taxes or other changes or restrictions will be imposed upon the importation offoreign produced products in the future or what effect such actions could haveon our business, financial condition or results of operations.Furthermore,our products depend on the availability of leather and other raw materials. Anysignificant shortage of quantities or increases in the cost of leather or othermaterials or resources used to produce our products could have a materialadverse effect on our business and results of operations. 13 BROWN      SHOE COMPANY, INC.2008      FORM 10-KChinaWe relyheavily on manufacturing facilities located in China. Historically, the traderelationship between the United States and China has not had a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. There havebeen, however, and may in the future be, threats to the trade relationshipsbetween the United States and China. There can be no assurance that the traderelationship between the United States and China will not worsen, and if it doesworsen, that our financial condition or results of operations will not bematerially adversely affected thereby.We cannotpredict the effect that changes in the economic and political conditions in theUnited States and China could have on the economics of doing business withChinese manufacturers. For example, manufacturing capacity in China may shiftfrom footwear to other industries with manufacturing margins that are perceivedto be higher. Currently, many footwear manufacturers in China are facing laborshortages as migrant workers seek better wages and working conditions in otherindustries and vocations. If this trend continues, our current manufacturers’operations could be adversely affected, and we may experience difficulties ordelays in sourcing our footwear as well as higher footwear costs.Althoughwe believe we could find alternative manufacturing sources for those products wecurrently source from China through independent third-party manufacturingfacilities in other countries, the loss of a substantial portion of our Chinesemanufacturing capacity would have a material adverse effect on the Company. Forexample, alternative manufacturers may have higher prices, less favorablepayment terms, less manufacturing capacity, lower quality standards or increasedlead times for delivery. If we are unable to provide products consistent withour standards or the manufacture of our footwear is delayed or becomes moreexpensive, this could result in our customers canceling orders, refusing toaccept deliveries or demanding reductions in purchase prices, any of which couldhave a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Inaddition, the occurrence of a natural disaster such as an earthquake orhurricane or the outbreak of a pandemic disease in China could severelyinterfere with the manufacture of our products and have a material adverseeffect on the Company.CurrencyAlthoughwe purchase most products from foreign manufacturers in United States dollarsand otherwise engage in foreign currency hedging transactions, we cannot ensurethat we will not experience cost variations with respect to exchange ratechanges. For example, although we purchase footwear made in China using UnitedStates dollars, recently Chinese manufacturers have been increasing their UnitedStates dollar prices to compensate for the appreciation of the Chinese currencyagainst the United States dollar. Also, if we continue to grow internationallyand increase our net sales in currencies other than the UnitedStates dollar, our exposure to foreign currencies willincrease.Weface risks relating to customer concentration.Ourwholesale customers include mass merchandisers, national chains, departmentstores, independent retailers, catalogs and online retailers. Several of ourcustomers operate multiple department store divisions. Furthermore, we oftensell multiple types of licensed, branded and private-label footwear to thesesame mass merchandisers, national chains, department stores, independentretailers, catalogs and online retailers. While we believe purchasing decisionsin many cases are made independently by the buyers and merchandisers of each ofthe customers, a decision by our customers who operate multiple massmerchandisers, national chains, department stores, independent retailers,catalogs and/or online retailers or any other significant customer to decreasethe amount of footwear products purchased from us could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition or results ofoperations.Theretail industry has experienced increased consolidation. As this trendcontinues, our customers will likely seek more favorable terms for theirpurchases of our products, which could limit our ability to raise prices orachieve our profit goals. In turn, we may not be able to recoup raw material orother cost increases. Sales on terms less favorable to us than our current termswill have an adverse effect on our profitability. Consolidation could lead to adecrease in the number of stores that carry our products and could expose us togreater concentration of accounts receivable risk. In addition, retailers aredeciding to source more of their products directly from manufacturers overseasand reducing their reliance on wholesalers. If retailers continue to increasetheir direct sourcing of footwear from overseas, this could have a materialadverse effect on our business and results of operations.Weare dependent on our information technology systems.Ourcomputer network and systems are essential to all aspects of our operations.

If we arecompelled to prosecute infringing parties, defend our intellectual property ordefend ourselves from intellectual property claims made by others, we may facesignificant expenses and liability. 15 BROWN      SHOE COMPANY, INC.2008      FORM 10-KWeare dependent on leased locations.OurFamous Footwear and Specialty Retail segments operate footwear stores. We leaseall of these stores. Accordingly, the success of our operations, in part, isdependent on our ability to secure affordable, long-term leases in desirablelocations and to secure renewals of such leases. Although we believe that ourcurrent leases can be renewed on acceptable terms, no assurance can be giventhat we will be able to successfully negotiate lease renewals on existing storesor to obtain acceptable terms for new stores in desirable locations, and thefailure to do so could have an adverse effect on our ability to grow ourbusiness and our financial condition and results of operations.Weare dependent on major branded suppliers.OurFamous Footwear retail chain purchases a substantial portion of its footwearproducts from major branded suppliers. While we believe our relationships withour current suppliers are good, the loss of any of our major suppliers orproduct developed exclusively for Famous Footwear could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As iscommon in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with oursuppliers. In addition, the success of our financial performance is dependent onthe ability of Famous Footwear to obtain products from its suppliers on a timelybasis and on acceptable terms.Wecannot assure the successful implementation of our growth strategy.DomesticOurgrowth strategy includes continued expansion of our Famous Footwear store base,continued growth in the distribution of our portfolio of owned and licensedbrands, continued launching of new brands, continued development of oure-commerce business and potential acquisitions. There can be no assurance thatwe will be able to successfully implement any or all of these strategies, whichcould lead to a decline in our results of operations.InternationalOurgrowth strategy includes the expansion of our brands internationally and thecontinued growth of our international sales. For example, we own a 51% equitystake in B&H Footwear Limited (“B&H Footwear”), a joint venture thatbegan marketing Naturalizer footwear in China in fall 2007. In addition, B&HFootwear sells Naturalizer footwear on a wholesale basis to our joint venturepartner, Hongguo International Holdings Limited (“Hongguo”). Hongguo then sellsNaturalizer products through retail stores in China. Our internationaloperations are subject to the many unique risks of doing business abroad,including, among other things, the ability to obtain and retain internationalrights to our licenses and trademarks. There can be no assurance that we will beable to successfully implement any or all of these strategies, which could leadto a decline in our results of operations.Wemay face transitional challenges with acquisitions.Periodically,we pursue acquisitions of other companies or businesses. Although we review therecords of acquisition candidates, such an in-depth review of the records maynot reveal existing or potential problems. As a result, we may not becomefamiliar enough with the business to fully assess its strengths and weaknesses,and accordingly, we may assume adverse operating conditions and/or unanticipatedliabilities, and the business may not perform as well as expected. We face therisk that the returns on acquisitions will not support the expenditures orindebtedness incurred to acquire such businesses. We also face the risk that wewill not be able to integrate acquisitions into our existing operationseffectively without substantial expense, delay or other operational or financialproblems. Integration may be hindered by, among other things, differingprocedures, including internal controls, business practices and technologysystems. We may need to allocate more management resources to integration thanwe planned, which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other profitableactivities.Weare subject to periodic litigation and other regulatoryproceedings.We are adefendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions (includingenvironmental matters) relating to our business. Due to the inherentuncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accuratelypredict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcomecould have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition andresults of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigationor regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are expensive and will require thatwe devote substantial resources and executive time to defend the Company. SeeItem 3, LegalProceedings, for further discussion of pending matters. 16 BROWN      SHOE COMPANY, INC.2008      FORM 10-KWeare subject to rising insurance costs.Weself-insure a significant portion of our expected losses under our workers’compensation, employment practices, health, disability, general, auto andproperty liability programs. The liabilities associated with the risks that areretained by us are estimated by considering our historical claims experience anddata from actuarial sources. The estimated accruals for these liabilities couldbe affected if claims differ from the assumptions used and historical trends.Unanticipated changes in the estimates underlying our reserves for these losses,such as claims experience, inflation and regulatory changes could have amaterial adverse effect on our financial condition and results ofoperations.Weface risks that our quarterly sales and earnings may fluctuate, which may resultin volatility in our stock price.Ourquarterly sales and earnings can vary due to a number of factors, many of whichare beyond our control. Accordingly, we may not be able to accurately predictour quarterly sales and earnings. In our wholesale business, sales of footwearare dependent on orders from our major customers and they may change deliveryschedules, change the mix of products they order or cancel orders withoutpenalty. In addition, our wholesale customers set the delivery schedule forshipments of our products, which could cause shifts of sales between quarters.Our Famous Footwear retail business is seasonally weighted to the back-to-schoolseason, which falls into our fiscal third quarter. In addition, our annualizedtax rate is based on projections of our domestic and international operatingresults for the year, which we review and revise as necessary each quarter. As aresult of these specific and other general factors, our operating results willvary from quarter to quarter, and the results for any particular quarter may notbe indicative of results for the full year. Any shortfall in sales or earningsfrom the levels expected by investors or securities analysts could cause adecrease in the trading price of our stock.Wecould be required to provide additional funding for our pension plans as aresult of the negative impact of current market returns on the return on planassets for our pension plans.As aresult of disruptions in the domestic and international financial markets, ourpension plans had a decrease in asset values during the year ended January 31,2009. We are unable to predict the severity or the duration of the currentdisruptions in the financial markets and the adverse economic conditions in theUnited States, Europe and Asia. We are not required to make any mandatorycontributions to our plans in 2009. Nevertheless, the funded status of theseplans, and the related cost reflected in our financial statements, are affectedby various factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty,particularly in the current economic environment. Under the Pension ProtectionAct of 2006 (the “Pension Protection Act”), continued losses of asset values maynecessitate increased funding of the plans in the future to meet minimum federalgovernment requirements. The continued downward pressure on the asset values ofthese plans may require us to fund obligations earlier than we had originallyplanned, which would have a negative impact on our cash flows fromoperations"
2,CAL,CALERES INC,2008-03-28,"ITEM 1A                            RISK      FACTORSCertainstatements in this Form 10-K, as well as other statements made by us from timeto time, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the PrivateSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differmaterially. The considerations listed below represent certain important factorswe believe could cause such results to differ. These considerations are notintended to represent a complete list of the general or specific risks that mayaffect the Company. It should be recognized that other risk factors (includingthose described in Item 7 — “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations”) may be significant, presently or in thefuture, and the risks set forth below may affect us to a greater extent thanindicated. We disclaim any intent or obligation to update these forward-lookingstatements.Weface risks relating to competition.Competitionis intense in the footwear industry. Certain of our competitors are larger andhave greater financial, marketing and technological resources than we do. Oursuccess depends upon our ability to remain competitive in the areas of style,price and quality, among others, and in part on our ability to anticipate andrespond to changing merchandise and fashion trends and consumer preferences anddemands in a timely manner. If we fail to gauge the fashion tastes of consumers,differentiate and effectively market our products or build inventory forproducts that are not accepted by consumers, this could adversely affect oursales or profit margins. If that occurs, we may have substantial unsoldinventory that we may need to mark down in order to sell, which would adverselyaffect our business and results of operations.Competitionin the retail footwear industry has increased, thereby elevating the level ofpressure on us to maintain the value proposition of our stores, footwear andshopping experience. The industry has also been impacted by retailersaggressively competing on the basis of price. Accordingly, there has beencompetitive pressure on us to keep our selling prices low. If we are unable torespond effectively to these competitive pressures, our business and results ofoperations will be adversely affected.Weface risks relating to changes in consumer preferences.Thefootwear industry is subject to rapidly changing consumer demands and fashiontrends. Accordingly, our success in both our wholesale and retail operationsdepends in large part on our ability to anticipate, understand and react tochanging consumer demands. Our products must appeal to a broad range ofconsumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subjectto rapid change. The success of our products, merchandising strategies andmarketing strategies and programs will also depend on a favorable reception byour customers. Furthermore, consumer preferences and purchasing patterns may beinfluenced by consumers’ disposable income. Consequently, the success of ouroperations may depend to a significant extent upon a number of factors affectingdisposable income, including general economic conditions and factors such asemployment, business conditions, consumer confidence, interest rates andtaxation.Werely on foreign sources of production.GeneralWe relyentirely on foreign sourcing for our footwear products. We source footwearproducts from independent third-party manufacturing facilities located in Chinaand Brazil and, to a lesser extent, from other countries. Typically, we are amajor customer of these third-party manufacturing facilities. However, there issubstantial competition in the footwear industry for quality footwearmanufacturers. Accordingly, our future results will partly depend on maintainingclose working relationships with our principal manufacturers.As iscommon in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with ourindependent third-party foreign manufacturers. We cannot ensure that we will notexperience difficulties with such manufacturers, including reduction in theavailability of production capacity, failure to meet production deadlines,increases in manufacturing costs or failure to meet our quality standards.Foreign manufacturing is subject to a number of risks, including transportationdelays and interruptions, work stoppages, political instability, expropriation,nationalization, foreign currency fluctuations, changing economic conditions,the imposition of tariffs, import and export controls and other non-tariffbarriers and changes in governmental policies.Werequire our third-party foreign manufacturers to meet our standards andfootwear-industry standards for working conditions and other matters, includingcompliance with applicable labor and other laws, before we place orders withthem to manufacture products for us. A failure by any of our third-partymanufacturers to adhere to these standards or laws could cause us to incuradditional costs for our products and could cause negative publicity and harmour business and reputation. We also require our third-party foreignmanufacturers to meet our and industry standards for product safety, includingcompliance with applicable laws and standards with respect to lead content inpaint and other child safety issues. A failure by any of our third-partymanufacturers to adhere to product safety standards could lead to a productrecall, which could result in critical media coverage and harm our business andreputation and could cause us to incur additional costs.11We cannotpredict whether additional United States or foreign customs quotas, duties,taxes or other changes or restrictions will be imposed upon the importation offoreign produced products in the future or what effect such actions could haveon our business, financial condition or results of operations.Furthermore,our products depend on the availability of leather and other raw materials. Anysignificant shortage of quantities or increases in the cost of leather or othermaterials or resources used to produce our products could have a materialadverse effect on our business and results of operations.ChinaWe relyheavily on manufacturing facilities located in China. Historically, the traderelationship between the United States and China has not had a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. There havebeen, however, and may in the future be, threats to the trade relationshipsbetween the United States and China. There can be no assurance that the traderelationship between the United States and China will not worsen, and if it doesworsen, that our financial condition or results of operations will not bematerially adversely affected thereby.We cannotpredict the effect that changes in the economic and political conditions inChina could have on the economics of doing business with Chinese manufacturers.For example, manufacturing capacity in China may shift from footwear to otherindustries with manufacturing margins that are perceived to be higher.Currently, many footwear manufacturers in China are facing labor shortages asmigrant workers seek better wages and working conditions in other industries andvocations. If this trend continues, our current manufacturers’ operations couldbe adversely affected, and we may experience difficulties or delays in sourcingour footwear as well as higher footwear costs. We are anticipating higherfootwear costs from these factories in 2008, particularly in the second half ofthe year, as a result of higher manufacturing labor costs, capacity constraintsand government labor law changes. Although we expect that a portion of thesehigher costs will be passed on to our customers, there can be no assurance thatwe will be successful in doing so. We anticipate that these higher costs mayhave the impact of reducing net sales and our gross profit percentage in2008.Althoughwe believe we could find alternative manufacturing sources for those products wecurrently source from China through our existing relationships with independentthird-party manufacturing facilities in other countries, the loss of asubstantial portion of our Chinese manufacturing capacity would have a materialadverse effect on the Company. For example, alternative manufacturers may havehigher prices, less favorable payment terms, less manufacturing capacity, lowerquality standards or increased lead times for delivery. If we are unable toprovide products consistent with our standards or the manufacture of ourfootwear is delayed or becomes more expensive, this could result in ourcustomers canceling orders, refusing to accept deliveries or demandingreductions in purchase prices, any of which could have a material adverse effecton our business and results of operations. In addition, the occurrence of anatural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane or the outbreak of apandemic disease in China could severely interfere with the manufacture of ourproducts and have a material adverse effect on the Company.CurrencyAlthoughwe purchase most products from foreign manufacturers in United States dollarsand otherwise engage in foreign currency hedging transactions, we cannot ensurethat we will not experience cost variations with respect to exchange ratechanges. For example, although we purchase footwear made in China using UnitedStates dollars, recently Chinese manufacturers have been increasing their UnitedStates dollar prices to compensate for the appreciation of the Chinese currencyagainst the United States dollar. Also, if we continue to grow internationallyand increase our net sales in currencies other than the UnitedStates dollar, our exposure to foreign currencies mayincrease.Weface risks relating to customer concentration.Ourwholesale customers include department stores, national chains and massmerchandisers. Several of our customers operate multiple department storedivisions. Furthermore, we often sell multiple brands and licensed andprivate-label footwear to these same department stores, national chains and massmerchandisers. While we believe purchasing decisions in many cases are madeindependently by the buyers and merchandisers of each of the customers, adecision by our customers who operate multiple department stores, nationalchains and/or mass merchandisers or any other significant customer to decreasethe amount of footwear products purchased from us could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition or results ofoperations.12Theretail industry has experienced increased consolidation. As this trendcontinues, our customers will likely seek more favorable terms for theirpurchases of our products, which could limit our ability to raise prices orachieve our profit goals. In turn, we may not be able to recoup raw material orother cost increases. Sales on terms less favorable to us than our current termswill have an adverse effect on our profitability. Consolidation could lead to adecrease in the number of stores that carry our products and could expose us togreater concentration of accounts receivable risk. In addition, larger retailersare deciding to source more of their products directly from manufacturersoverseas and reducing their reliance on wholesalers. If retailers continue toincrease their direct sourcing of footwear from overseas, this could have amaterial adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Weface risks relating to our licensed and owned intellectualproperty.LicensesThesuccess of our Wholesale Operations segment has to date been due, in part, toour ability to attract and retain licensors which have strong, well-recognizedbrands and trademarks. Our license agreements are generally for an initial termof two to four years, subject to renewal, but even where we have longer-termlicenses or have an option to renew a license, such agreements are dependentupon our achieving certain results in marketing the licensed products. While webelieve we will generally be able to decide whether to renew our existinglicenses and obtain new licenses in the future, there can be no assurance wewill be able to renew our current licenses or obtain new licenses. In addition,certain of our license agreements are not exclusive, and new or existingcompetitors may obtain similar licenses.Many ofour license agreements require minimum royalty payments. Our ability to generatesufficient sales and profitability to cover these minimum royalty requirementsis not guaranteed, and if sales of such products are not sufficient to generatethese minimum payments, it could have a material adverse effect on our businessand results of operations.TrademarksWebelieve that our trademarks and trade names are important to our business andare generally sufficient to permit us to carry on our business as presentlyconducted and planned. We cannot, however, know whether we will be able tosecure protection for our intellectual property in the future or if thatprotection will be adequate for future operations. Furthermore, we face the riskof ineffective protection of intellectual property rights in jurisdictions wherewe source and distribute our products. We also cannot be certain that ouractivities do not infringe on the proprietary rights of others. If we arecompelled to prosecute infringing parties, defend our intellectual property ordefend ourselves from intellectual property claims made by others, we may facesignificant expenses and liability.Weare dependent on leased locations.OurFamous Footwear and Specialty Retail segments operate chains of footwear stores.We lease all of these stores. Accordingly, the success of our operations, inpart, is dependent on our ability to secure affordable, long-term leases indesirable locations and to secure renewals of such leases. Although we believethat our current leases can be renewed on acceptable terms, no assurance can begiven that we will be able to successfully negotiate lease renewals on existingstores or to obtain acceptable terms for new stores in desirable locations, andthe failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our ability to grow ourbusiness and our financial condition and results of operations.Weare dependent on major branded suppliers.OurFamous Footwear retail chain purchases a substantial portion of its footwearproducts from major branded suppliers. While we believe our relationships withour current suppliers are good, the loss of any of our major suppliers orproduct developed exclusively for Famous Footwear could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As iscommon in the industry, we do not have any long-term contracts with oursuppliers. In addition, the success of our financial performance is dependent onthe ability of Famous Footwear to obtain products from its suppliers on a timelybasis and on acceptable terms.Weare subject to periodic litigation and other regulatoryproceedings.We are adefendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions (includingenvironmental matters) relating to our business. Due to the inherentuncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accuratelypredict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcomecould have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition andresults of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigationor regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are expensive and will require thatwe devote substantial resources and executive time to defend the Company. SeeItem 3, “Legal Proceedings,” for further discussion of pendingmatters.13Wecannot assure the successful implementation of our growth strategy.DomesticOurgrowth strategy includes continued expansion of our Famous Footwear store base,continued growth in the distribution of our portfolio of owned and licensedbrands, continued development of our e-commerce business and potentialacquisitions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfullyimplement any or all of these strategies, which could lead to a decline in ourresults of operations.InternationalOurgrowth strategy includes the expansion of our brands internationally and thecontinued growth of our international sales. For example, we own a 51% equitystake in B&H Footwear Limited, a joint venture that plans to openapproximately 75 stores and department store shops carrying the Naturalizerbrand and approximately 30 carrying the Via Spiga brand over the next severalyears. In addition, we sell footwear on a wholesale basis to our joint venturepartner, Hongguo International Holdings Limited, which plans to open 350 storesand department store shops carrying the Naturalizer brand and approximately 70carrying the Via Spiga brand over the next several years. Our internationaloperations are subject to the many unique risks of doing business abroad,including, among other things, the ability to obtain and retain internationalrights to our licenses and trademarks. There can be no assurance that we will beable to successfully implement any or all of these strategies, which could leadto a decline in our results of operations.Wemay face transitional challenges with acquisitions.Periodically,we pursue acquisitions of other companies or businesses. Although we review therecords of acquisition candidates, such an in-depth review of the records maynot reveal existing or potential problems. As a result, we may not becomefamiliar enough with the business to fully assess its strengths and weaknesses,and accordingly, we may assume adverse operating conditions and/or unanticipatedliabilities, and the business may not perform as well as expected. We face therisk that the returns on acquisitions will not support the expenditures orindebtedness incurred to acquire such businesses. We also face the risk that wewill not be able to integrate acquisitions into our existing operationseffectively without substantial expense, delay or other operational or financialproblems. Integration may be hindered by, among other things, differingprocedures, including internal controls, business practices and technologysystems. We may need to allocate more management resources to integration thanwe planned, which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other profitableactivities.Wemay be unable to successfully implement our Earnings EnhancementPlan.Asannounced in 2006, we have begun to review and implement strategic initiativesas part of our Earnings Enhancement Plan, with the goal of increasing earningsand reallocating resources and investment to drive consumer preference. Ourbusiness and results of operations could be adversely affected if we are notable to implement our Earnings Enhancement Plan effectively by, among otherthings:·  Restructuring      administrative and support areas,·  Redesigning      logistics and distributionplatforms,·  Reorganizing      to eliminate operationalredundancies,·  Realigning      strategic priorities, and·  Refining      the supply chain process and enhancing inventory    utilization.Wemay be unable to retain senior management and to recruit and retain other keyassociates.Oursuccess depends on the ability to attract, retain and motivate qualifiedmanagement, administrative, product development and sales personnel to supportexisting operations and future growth. Competition for qualified personnel inthe footwear industry is intense, and we compete for these individuals withother companies that in many cases have substantial financial and otherresources. The loss of the services of any members of senior management or theinability to attract and retain other qualified personnel could have a materialadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financialcondition.14Weare subject to rising insurance costs.Weself-insure a significant portion of our expected losses under our workers’compensation, employment practices, health, disability, general, auto andproperty liability programs. The liabilities associated with the risks that areretained by us are estimated by considering our historical claims experience anddata from actuarial sources. The estimated accruals for these liabilities couldbe affected if claims differ from the assumptions used and historical trends.Unanticipated changes in the estimates underlying our reserves for these losses,such as claims experience, inflation and regulatory changes could have amaterial adverse effect on our financial condition and results ofoperations.Weare dependent on our information technology systems.Ourcomputer network and systems are essential to all aspects of our operations. Ifthere were to be a major disruption of our information technology operations, wehave emergency back-up facility arrangements and procedures in place. However,if a disruption is of a nature that delays or prohibits implementation ofback-up arrangements, it could have a material adverse effect on our results ofoperations.Inaddition, our retail stores and e-commerce sites process debit and credit cardtransactions. We believe we have established appropriate controls to protect theconsumers’ personal confidential information gathered when a debit or creditcard is utilized. However, in the event that such confidential information ismisused or obtained by an unauthorized third-party, we could be subject tonegative publicity that could harm our business, as well as have a materialadverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Weface risks that our quarterly sales and earnings may fluctuate, which may resultin volatility in our stock price.Ourquarterly sales and earnings can vary due to a number of factors, many of whichare beyond our control. Accordingly, we may not be able to accurately predictour quarterly sales and earnings. In our wholesale business, sales of footwearare dependent on orders from our major customers and they may change deliveryschedules, change the mix of products they order or cancel orders withoutpenalty.
