9,CAG,CONAGRA BRANDS INC,2006-07-28,"ITEM 1A.        RISKFACTORSThe following factorscould affect the Companys operating results and should be considered inevaluating the Company.The Company mustidentify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products tomeet their preferences.Consumer preferencesevolve over time and the success of the Companys food products depends on theCompanys ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and tooffer products that appeal to their preferences. Introduction of new productsand product extensions requires significant development and marketinginvestment. If the Companys products fail to meet consumer preference, thenthe return on that investment will be less than anticipated and the Companysstrategy to grow sales and profits with investments in core products will beless successful.If the Company doesnot achieve the appropriate cost structure in the highly competitive foodindustry, its profitability could decrease.The Companys success depends in part on its abilityto achieve the appropriate cost structure and be efficient in the highlycompetitive food industry. The Company is currently implementingprofit-enhancing initiatives that impact its supply chain and general andadministrative functions. These initiatives are focused on cost savingsopportunities in procurement, manufacturing, logistics and customer service, aswell as general overhead levels. If the Company does not continue to managecosts and achieve additional efficiencies, its competitiveness and itsprofitability could decrease.The Companys success isalso dependent on the successful implementation of its strategy to divestnon-core operations that have limited the Companys ability to achieve itsefficiency targets. The Company completed the divestitures of its Cooks Hamand its seafood operations during fiscal 2006 and expects to complete itsdivestitures of the packaged meats and cheese businesses in the first half of fiscal2007. If the Company is not able to continue to successfully alter its assetportfolio to focus on higher-margin, branded and value-added businesses, itscompetitiveness and profitability could decrease.Increasedcompetition may result in reduced sales or margin for the Company.The food industry ishighly competitive, and increased competition can reduce sales for the Companydue to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond tocompetitive and customer pressures. Competitive pressures also may restrict theCompanys ability to increase prices, including in response to commodity andother cost increases. The Companys profit margins could decrease if areduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increasedsales volume.6The consolidationof the Companys customers has resulted in large sophisticated customers withincreased buying power.The Companys customers,such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors, have consolidatedin recent years and consolidation is expected to continue. These consolidationshave produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power andnegotiating strength who are more capable of resisting price increases andoperating with reduced inventories. These customers may also in the future usemore of their shelf space, currently used for Company products, for theirprivate label products.  The Company isimplementing initiatives to counteract these pressures; however, if the largersize of these customers results in additional negotiating strength or lessshelf space for Company products, the Companys profitability could decline.The Company may besubject to product liability claims and product recalls, which could negativelyimpact its profitability.The Company sells foodproducts for human consumption, which involves risks such as productcontamination or spoilage, product tampering and other adulteration of foodproducts. The Company may be subject to liability if the consumption of any ofits products causes injury, illness or death. In addition, the Company willvoluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage. In thepast, the Company has issued recalls and has from time to time been involved inlawsuits relating to its food products. A significant product liabilityjudgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact the Companysprofitability for a period of time depending on product availability,competitive reaction and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability claimis unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding anyassertion that Company products caused illness or injury could adversely affectthe Companys reputation with existing and potential customers and itscorporate and brand image.Commodity priceincreases will increase operating costs and may reduce profits.The Company uses manydifferent commodities including wheat, corn, oats, soybeans, beef, pork,poultry, and energy. Commodities are subject to price volatility caused bycommodity market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuations, andchanges in governmental agricultural programs. Commodity price increases willresult in increases in raw material costs and operating costs. The Company maynot be able to increase its product prices to offset these increased costs, andincreasing prices may result in reduced sales volume and profitability. TheCompany has many years experience in hedging against commodity priceincreases; however, hedging practices reduce but do not eliminate the risk ofincreased operating costs from commodity price increases.The Companysinformation technology resources must provide efficient connections between itsbusiness functions, or its results of operations will be negatively impacted.Each year the Companyengages in several billion dollars of transactions with its customers andvendors. Because the amount of dollars involved is so significant, the Companysinformation technology resources must provide connections among its marketing,sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer service, and accounting functions. Ifthe Company does not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary tobuild and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain therelated computerized and manual control processes, it could be subject tobilling and collection errors, business disruptions or damage resulting fromsecurity breaches. In 2005, in connection with its implementation of Project Nucleus, theCompanys information technology-linking initiative, the Company had short-termoperational challenges during the third quarter of fiscal 2005. If futureimplementation problems are encountered, the Companys results of operationscould be negatively impacted.7 If the Companyfails to comply with the many laws applicable to its business, it may incursignificant fines and penalties.The Companys facilities and products are subject to many laws andregulations administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, theFederal Food and Drug Administration, and other federal, state, local, andforeign governmental agencies relating to the processing, packaging, storage,distribution, advertising, labeling, quality, and safety of food products. TheCompanys failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subjectit to administrative penalties and injunctive relief, civil remedies, includingfines, injunctions and recalls of its products. The Companys operations arealso subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administeredby the Environmental Protection Agency, which pertain to the discharge ofmaterials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes. Failureto comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including civiland administrative penalties and negative publicity"
