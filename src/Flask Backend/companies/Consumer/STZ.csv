6,STZ,CONSTELLATION BRANDS,2019-04-23,"Risk Factors
.In addition to information discussed elsewhere in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.  The risks described below are not the only risks we face.  Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations in future periods.Operational RisksInternational operations, worldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions, geopolitical uncertainty, or changes to international trade agreements and tariffs, import and excise duties, other taxes, or other governmental rules and regulationsOur products are produced and sold in numerous countries, we have employees in various countries and we have production facilities currently in the U.S., Mexico, New Zealand, Italy and Canada.Risks associated with international operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations, include:•changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions;•potential disruption from socio-economic violence, including terrorism and drug-related violence;•restrictions on foreign ownership and investments or on repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;•import and export requirements;•currency exchange rate fluctuations;•a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment in some countries, which, among other things, can create uncertainty regarding contract enforcement, intellectual property rights, real property rights, and liability issues; and•inadequate levels of compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.Unfavorable global or regional economic conditions, including economic slowdown, inflation, and the disruption, volatility and tightening of credit and capital markets, as well as unemployment, tax increases, governmental spending cuts or a return of high levels of inflation, could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our products.  These could also create or exacerbate credit issues, cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and our suppliers, distributors, retailers and consumers.  The inability of suppliers, distributors and retailers to access liquidity could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products.10Table of ContentsWe are also exposed to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.  We could experience changes in our ability to manage fluctuations in interest rates and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reducing those risks.We could also be affected by nationalization of our international operations, unstable governments, unfamiliar or biased legal systems, intergovernmental disputes or animus against the United States.  Any determination that our operations or activities did not comply with applicable U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, interruptions of business, terminations of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal and equitable sanctions.The U.S. and other countries in which we operate impose duties, excise taxes, and/or other taxes on beverage alcohol products, and/or on certain raw materials used to produce our beverage alcohol products, in varying amounts.  The U.S. federal government or other governmental bodies may propose changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, taxes and other government rules and regulations.  Significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on, or that impact, beverage alcohol products could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.In addition, federal, state, provincial, local and foreign governmental agencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol products industry concerning such matters as licensing, warehousing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and required labeling, advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers.  Certain federal, state or local regulations also require warning labels and signage.  New or revised regulations or increased licensing fees, requirements or taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.  Additionally, various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products because of what our products contain or allegations that our products cause adverse health effects.  If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our major products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products.These international, economic and political uncertainties and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations, especially to the extent these matters, or the decisions, policies or economic strength of our suppliers and distributors, affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.Dependence on limited facilities for production of our Mexican beer brands, and expansion and construction issuesWe are dependent on our Nava and Obregon breweries as our sole sources of supply to fulfill our Mexican beer brands product requirements, both now as well as for the near term.We are currently expanding our Obregon Brewery and constructing our Mexicali Brewery, and our joint venture with Owens-Illinois is expanding its glass plant.  While these multi-million-dollar expansion and construction activities are progressing consistent with our plans, there is always the potential risk of completion delays and cost overruns.Expansion of current production facilities and construction of new production facilities are subject to various regulatory and developmental risks, including but not limited to: (i)  our ability to obtain timely certificate authorizations, necessary approvals and permits from regulatory agencies and on terms that are acceptable to us; (ii)  potential changes in federal, state and local statutes and regulations, including environmental requirements, that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project; (iii)  inability to acquire rights-of-way or land or water rights on a timely basis on terms that are acceptable to us; and (iv)  inability to acquire the necessary energy supplies, including electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel.  Any of these events could delay the expansion or construction of our production facilities.We may not be able to satisfy our product supply requirements for the Mexican beer brands in the event of a significant disruption, partial destruction or total destruction of the Nava or Obregon breweries or the glass plant, or 11Table of Contentsdifficulty shipping raw materials and product into or out of the United States.  Also, if the contemplated expansions of the Obregon Brewery and the glass plant and construction of the Mexicali Brewery are not completed by their targeted completion dates, we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of our Mexican beer to satisfy our needs.  Under such circumstances, we may be unable to obtain our Mexican beer at a reasonable price from another source, if at all.  A significant disruption at our Nava or Obregon breweries, or the glass plant, even on a short-term basis, could impair our ability to produce and ship products to market on a timely basis.  Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.Operational disruptions or catastrophic loss to breweries, wineries, other production facilities or distribution systemsAll of our Mexican beer brands product supply is currently produced at our breweries in Nava, Coahuila, Mexico and Obregon, Sonora, Mexico.  Many of the workers at these breweries are covered by collective bargaining agreements.  The glass plant currently produces approximately half of the total annual glass bottle supply for our Mexican beer brands.  Several of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities, including certain California wineries and breweries and our planned Mexicali Brewery, are in areas prone to seismic activity.  Additionally, we have various vineyards, wineries and breweries in the state of California which has recently experienced wildfires and landslides.If any of these or other of our properties and production facilities were to experience a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss, it could delay or disrupt production, shipments and revenue, and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace these properties.  Also, our production facilities are asset intensive.  As our operations are concentrated in a limited number of production and distribution facilities, we are more likely to experience a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss in any one location from acts of war or terrorism, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, labor strike or other labor activities, cyber-attacks and other attempts to penetrate our information technology systems, unavailability of raw or packaging materials, or other natural or man-made events.  If a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations could be adversely affected due to higher maintenance charges, unexpected capital spending or product supply constraints.Our insurance policies do not cover certain types of catastrophes.  Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain property damage and business interruption insurance.  If our insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at greater risk that we may experience an adverse impact to our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.  If one or more significant uninsured or under-insured events occur, we could suffer a major financial loss.Supply of quality water, agricultural and other raw materials, certain raw materials and packaging materials purchased under short-term supply contracts, limited group of suppliers of glass bottlesThe quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of our agricultural raw materials and our ability to operate our business.  Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe, there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints.  We are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of our breweries, our wineries and our distilleries, as well as to irrigate our vineyards and conduct our other operations.  The suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their vineyards and fields.  If water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarce or the quality of that water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints.  In addition, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of our production facilities and vineyards.  A substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines or other crops, such as barley or hops, which could lead to a shortage of our product supply.12Table of ContentsWe have substantial brewery operations in the country of Mexico, brewery operations in the states of California, Texas, Virginia and Florida, and we currently have substantial wine operations in the state of California as well.  In the past, California had endured an extended period of drought and instituted restrictions on water usage.  A recurrence of severe drought conditions in California could have an adverse effect upon those operations, which effect could become more significant depending upon actual future drought conditions.  Our Nava Brewery and glass plant receive water originating from a mountain aquifer.  Our Obregon Brewery receives its allocation of water originating from an aquifer and we expect our Mexicali Brewery will receive an allocation of water originating from an aquifer.  Although we anticipate our operations will have adequate sources of water to support their on-going requirements, there is no guarantee that the sources of water, methods of water delivery, or water requirements will not change materially in the future.Our breweries, the glass plant, our wineries and our distilleries use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce their products.  These include corn starch and sugars, malt, hops, fruits, yeast and water for our breweries; soda ash and silica sand for the glass plant; grapes and water for our wineries; and grain and water for our distilleries.  Our breweries, wineries and distilleries all use large amounts of various packaging materials, including glass, aluminum, cardboard and other paper products.  Our production facilities also use electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel in their operations.  Certain raw materials and packaging materials are purchased under contracts of varying maturities.  The supply and price of raw materials, packaging materials and energy can be affected by many factors beyond our control, including market demand, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices), droughts and other weather conditions or natural or man-made events, economic factors affecting growth decisions, inflation, plant diseases and theft.Our breweries, wineries and distilleries are also dependent upon an adequate supply of glass bottles.  Glass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold.  We currently have a small number of suppliers of glass bottles for our Mexican beer brands.  In the U.S., glass bottles have only a small number of producers.  Currently, one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our U.S. wine and spirits operations and two producers supply our glass bottles for our craft beer.To the extent any of the foregoing factors increases the costs of our finished products or lead to a shortage of our product supply, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.Reliance on wholesale distributors, major retailers and government agenciesLocal market structures and distribution channels vary worldwide.  Within our primary market in the U.S., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the beer, wine and spirits categories, with separate distribution networks utilized for our beer portfolio and our wine and spirits portfolio.  In the U.S., we sell our products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets and directly to government agencies, and we have entered into exclusive arrangements with certain wholesalers that generate a large portion of our U.S. wine and spirits net sales.  Wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which compete directly with our products for retail shelf space, promotional support and consumer purchases, and wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products of our competitors.  The replacement or poor performance of our major wholesalers, retailers or government agencies could result in temporary or longer-term sales disruptions or could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.Reliance upon complex information systems and third party global networks, cyber-attacks, and design and implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system (“ERP”)We depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers and suppliers, as well as maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and effect accurate and timely governmental reporting.  If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach, or penalties associated with the failure to timely file governmental reports.  We recognize that many groups on a world-wide basis have 13Table of Contentsexperienced increases in security breaches, cyber-attacks, and other hacking activities such as denial of service, malware, and ransomware.  As with all large information technology systems, our systems could be penetrated by increasingly sophisticated outside parties intent on extracting confidential or proprietary information, corrupting our information, disrupting our business processes, or engaging in the unauthorized use of strategic information about us or our employees, customers or consumers.  Such unauthorized access could disrupt our operations and could result in the loss of assets or revenues, litigation, remediation costs, damage to our reputation, or the failure by us to retain or attract customers following such an event.We have outsourced various functions to third-party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future.  We rely on those third-party service providers to provide services on a timely and effective basis.  However, we do not ultimately control their performance.  Their failure to perform as expected or as required by contract could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations.We are in the process of a multi-year implementation of a new ERP system which we intend to replace our existing operating and financial systems in fiscal 2020 and 2021.  We are designing the ERP system to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to our management team related to the operation of the business.  We expect the implementation process will require the investment of significant personnel and financial resources.  Companies which implement new ERP systems may experience delays, increased costs and other difficulties.  If we are not successful in designing and implementing our ERP system as planned or if it does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected, our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed, or we may not be able to operate our business.To the extent any of the foregoing factors result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations, or reduce the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.Contamination and degradation of product quality from diseases, pests and weather conditionsOur success depends upon the positive image that consumers have of our brands and of the safety and quality of our products.  Contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our brands, could adversely affect their sales.  Various diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, drought, frosts and certain other weather conditions could affect the quality and quantity of barley, hops, grapes and other agricultural raw materials available, decreasing the supply and quality of our products.  We cannot guarantee that our grape suppliers or our suppliers of other agricultural raw materials will succeed in preventing contamination in existing vineyards or fields or that we will succeed in preventing contamination in our existing vineyards or future vineyards we may acquire.  Future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in growing grapes or other agricultural raw materials may increase vineyard costs and/or reduce production of grapes or other crops.  It is also possible that a supplier may not provide materials or product components which meet our required standards or may falsify documentation associated with the fulfillment of those requirements.Product contamination or tampering or the failure to maintain our standards for product quality, safety and integrity, including with respect to raw materials, naturally occurring compounds, packaging materials or product components obtained from suppliers, may also reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.  Contaminants or other defects in raw materials, packaging materials or product components purchased from third parties and used in the production of our beer, wine or spirits products or defects in the fermentation or distillation process could lead to low beverage quality as well as illness among, or injury to, consumers of our products and may result in reduced sales of the affected brand or all our brands.If any of our products become unsafe or unfit for consumption, are misbranded, or cause injury, we may have to engage in a product recall and/or be subject to liability and incur additional costs.  A widespread product recall, multiple product recalls, or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period, which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity.14Table of ContentsClimate change and environmental regulatory complianceOur business depends upon agricultural activity and natural resources.  There has been much public discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters.  Severe weather events, such as drought or flooding in California or a prolonged cold winter in New York, and climate change may negatively affect agricultural productivity in the regions from which we presently source our various agricultural raw materials.  Decreased availability of our raw materials may increase the cost of goods for our products.  Severe weather events or changes in the frequency or intensity of weather events can also disrupt our supply chain, which may affect production operations, insurance cost and coverage, as well as delivery of our products to wholesalers, retailers and consumers.  Natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes may also negatively impact the ability of consumers to purchase our products. We may experience significant future increases in the costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance, including fees, licenses, and the cost of capital improvements for our operating facilities to meet environmental regulatory requirements.  In addition, we may be party to various environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of our business or relating to historical activities of businesses we acquire.  Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants in our current and former properties, the potential exists for remediation, liability and indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs that we have estimated.  We may incur costs associated with environmental compliance arising from events we cannot control, such as unusually severe floods, hurricanes, earthquakes or fires.  We cannot assure you that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our projections or otherwise have a material adverse effect upon our business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.Cannabis is currently illegal under U.S. federal law and in other jurisdictions; we do not control Canopy’s business or operationsThe ability of Canopy to achieve its business objectives is contingent, in part, upon the legality of the cannabis industry, Canopy’s compliance with regulatory requirements enacted by various governmental authorities, and Canopy obtaining all regulatory approvals, where necessary, for the production and sale of its products.  The laws and regulations governing medical and recreational cannabis are still developing, including in ways that we may not foresee.  Although the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 has taken hemp and hemp derived cannabinoids out of the most restrictive class of controlled substances, marijuana is a schedule-1 controlled substance in the U.S. and is currently illegal under U.S. federal law.  Even in those U.S. states in which the recreational use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of U.S. federal law.  Since U.S. federal laws criminalizing the use of marijuana preempt state laws that legalize its use, continuation of U.S. federal law in its current state regarding marijuana would likely limit the expansion of Canopy’s business into the U.S.  Similar issues of illegality apply in other countries.  Any amendment to or replacement of existing laws to make them more onerous, or delays in amending or replacing existing laws to liberalize the legal possession and use of cannabis, or delays in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, any necessary regulatory approvals may significantly delay or impact negatively Canopy’s markets, products and sales initiatives and could have a material adverse effect on Canopy’s business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.  Were that to occur, we may not be able to recover the value of our investments in Canopy.We have the right to nominate four members of the Canopy board of directors.  While we do not control Canopy’s business or operations, we do rely on Canopy’s internal controls and procedures for operation of that business.  Nevertheless, our financing arrangements require us to certify, among other things, that to our knowledge (i)  Canopy is properly licensed and operating in accordance with Canadian laws in all material respects; (ii)  Canopy does not knowingly or intentionally purchase, manufacture, distribute, import and/or sell marijuana or any other controlled substance in or from the United States of America or any other jurisdiction, in each case, where such purchase, manufacture, distribution, importation or sale of marijuana or such other controlled substance is illegal, except in compliance with all applicable Federal, state, local or foreign laws, rules and regulations; and (iii)  Canopy does not knowingly or intentionally partner with, invest in, or distribute marijuana or any other controlled substance to any third-party that knowingly or intentionally purchases, sells, manufactures, or distributes marijuana or any other controlled substance in the United States of America or any other jurisdiction, in each case, 15Table of Contentswhere such purchase, sale, manufacture or distribution of marijuana or such other controlled substance is illegal, except in compliance with all applicable Federal, state, local or foreign laws, rules and regulations.  Were we to know that Canopy was knowingly or intentionally violating any of these applicable laws, we would be unable to make the required certification under our financing arrangements, which could lead to a default under those financing arrangements.Strategic RisksCompetitionWe are in a highly competitive industry and our sales could be negatively affected by numerous factors including:•our inability to maintain or increase prices;•new entrants in our market or categories;•the decision of wholesalers, retailers or consumers to purchase competitors’ products instead of ours; or•a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption due to consumer dietary preference changes or consumers substituting legalized marijuana or other similar products in lieu of beverage alcohol.Sales could also be affected by pricing, purchasing, financing, operational, advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers, state and other local agencies, and retailers which could affect their supply of, or consumer demand for, our products.  We could also experience higher than expected selling, general and administrative expenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising or marketing expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasons.  We cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase our prices to pass along to our customers any increased costs we incur.Potential decline in the consumption of products we sell; dependence on sales of our Mexican beer brandsOur business depends upon consumers’ consumption of our beer, wine and spirits brands, and sales of our Mexican beer brands in the U.S. are a significant portion of our business.  Accordingly, a decline in the growth rate, amount or profitability of our sales of the Mexican beer brands in the U.S. could adversely affect our business.  Further, consumer preferences and tastes may shift due to, among other reasons, changing taste preferences, demographics or perceived value.  Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences and taste in our major markets away from our beer, wine and spirits brands, and our Mexican beer brands in particular, from the categories in which they compete could have a negative impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.  Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including changes in demographic or social trends, public health policies, and changes in leisure, dining and beverage consumption patterns.  A limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including:•a general decline in economic or geopolitical conditions;•concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and driving;•a general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in on-premise establishments, such as may result from stricter laws relating to driving while under the influence of alcohol;•the increased activity of anti-alcohol groups;•increased federal, state, provincial and foreign excise or other taxes on beverage alcohol products and possible restrictions on beverage alcohol advertising and marketing;•increased regulation placing restrictions on the purchase or consumption of beverage alcohol products or increasing prices due to the imposition of duties or excise tax or changes to international trade agreements or tariffs;•inflation; and•wars, pandemics, weather and natural or man-made disasters.16Table of ContentsAcquisition, divestiture, investment, and new product development strategiesFrom time to time, we acquire businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe will provide a strategic fit with our business.  We integrate acquired businesses with our existing operations; our overall internal control over financial reporting processes; and our financial, operations and information systems.  If the financial performance of our business, as supplemented by the assets and businesses acquired, does not meet our expectations, it may make it more difficult for us to service our debt obligations and our results of operations may fail to meet market expectations.  We may not effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or within the anticipated costs or timeframes, retain key customers and suppliers or key employees of acquired businesses, or successfully implement our business plan for the combined business.  In addition, our final determinations and appraisals of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates and we may fail to realize fully anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities or other potential synergies.  We cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses or investments will remain constant.We may also divest ourselves of businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe no longer provide a strategic fit with our business.  We may provide various indemnifications in connection with the divestiture of businesses or assets.  Divestitures of portions of our business may also result in costs stranded in our remaining business. Delays in developing or implementing plans to address such costs could delay or prevent the accomplishment of our financial objectives.We have also acquired or retained ownership interests in companies which we do not control, such as our joint venture to operate a glass plant adjacent to our Nava Brewery, our interest in Canopy, and investments made through our corporate ventures capital function.  Our joint venture partners or the other parties that hold the remaining ownership interests in companies which we do not control may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint ventures or those companies.  Our joint venture arrangements and the arrangements through which we acquired or hold our other equity or membership interests may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs, to make capital investments, to fulfill alone our joint venture partners’ obligations, or to purchase other parties’ interests. We recently increased our investment in Canopy.  While we will not develop, distribute, manufacture or sell cannabis products in the U.S., or anywhere else in the world, unless it is legally permissible to do so at all governmental levels in the particular jurisdiction, this investment could affect consumer perception of our existing brands and our reputation with various constituencies.In addition, our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products.  The launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain, especially with respect to consumer appeal.  The launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and an unsuccessful launch, among other things, can affect consumer perception of existing brands and our reputation.  Unsuccessful implementation or short-lived popularity of our product innovations may result in inventory write-offs and other costs.We cannot assure you that we will realize the expected benefits of acquisitions, divestitures or investments.  We also cannot assure you that our acquisitions, investments or joint ventures will be profitable or that forecasts regarding acquisition, divestiture or investment activities will be accurate.  Our failure to adequately manage the risks associated with acquisitions or divestitures, or the failure of an entity in which we have an equity or membership interest, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.Sale of a portion of our wine and spirits businessAs previously announced, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell a portion of our wine and spirits business, including approximately 30 lower-margin, lower-growth wine and spirits brands, wineries, vineyards, offices and facilities.  The divestiture of this portion of our business will enable us to focus on our higher-margin, higher-growth wine and spirits brands.  The Wine and Spirits Transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approval, and we cannot guarantee the transaction will 17Table of Contentsoccur on the terms, conditions or timetable that we currently anticipate.  We intend to use the net proceeds from this transaction primarily to reduce our outstanding borrowings.  A delay in completing this transaction, or the failure to complete this transaction, could delay the accomplishment of our strategic and financial objectives.  Moreover, the Wine and Spirits Transaction will reduce the diversification of our portfolio.  We may not fully realize the expected benefits of a portfolio of higher-end wine and spirits brands.Our Canopy investments are dependent upon an emerging market and legal sales of cannabis productsThe legal cannabis market is an emerging market.  The legislative framework pertaining to the Canadian cannabis market, as well as cannabis markets in other countries, is uncertain.  The success of the Canopy transactions will depend on, among other things, the ability of Canopy to create a strong platform for us to operate successfully in the cannabis market space.  There is no assurance a robust cannabis consumer market will develop consistent with our expectations or that consumers will purchase any Canopy products.A failure in the demand for Canopy’s products to materialize as a result of competition, consumer desire, competition from legal and illegal market entrants or other products, or other factors could have a material adverse effect on Canopy’s business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.  Were that to occur, we may have to write down the value of our investments in Canopy.  The changing legal landscape and the lack of consumer market data makes it difficult to predict the pace at which the cannabis market may grow, if at all, and the products that consumers will purchase in the cannabis marketplace.For example, the Canadian Cannabis Act prohibits testimonials, lifestyle branding and packaging that is appealing to youth.  The restrictions on advertising, marketing and the use of logos and brand names could have a material adverse effect on Canopy’s business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations, and our investment in Canopy.Additionally, Canopy must rely on its own market research to forecast sales as detailed forecasts may not be fully available at this early stage in the cannabis industry in Canada and globally.  Market research relating to the adult-use recreational legal cannabis industry is in its early stages and, as such, trends can only be forecasted.Dependence upon trademarks and proprietary rights, failure to protect our intellectual property rightsOur future success depends significantly on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights.  We have been granted numerous trademark registrations covering our brands and products and have filed, and expect to continue to file, trademark applications seeking to protect newly-developed brands and products.  We cannot be sure that trademark registrations will be issued with respect to any of our trademark applications.  We could also, by omission, fail to timely renew or protect a trademark and our competitors could challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us.Financial RisksIndebtednessWe have incurred indebtedness to finance investments and acquisitions, fund beer operations expansion and construction activities and repurchase shares of our common stock.  In the future, we may continue to incur additional indebtedness to finance investments and acquisitions, repurchase shares of our stock and fund other general corporate purposes, including beer operations expansion and construction activities.  We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet all our debt service requirements, pay dividends, repurchase shares of our common stock, and fund our general corporate and capital requirements.18Table of ContentsOur current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have important consequences.  These consequences include, or may include, the following:•our ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or investments/acquisitions or other purposes may be limited;•our funds available for operations, expansions and construction, dividends or other distributions, or stock repurchases may be reduced because we dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;•our ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants; and•our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than less leveraged competitors and, thus, our ability to withstand competitive pressures may be limited.Additionally, any failure to meet required payments on our debt, or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt, could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments and a downgrade to our credit ratings.  A downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper.  Certain of our debt facilities also contain change of control provisions which, if triggered, may result in an acceleration of our obligation to repay the debt.If we fail to comply with the obligations contained in our senior credit facility, our existing or future indentures, or other loan agreements, we could be in default under such debt facilities or agreements.  In the event of a default, the holders of our debt could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such instrument to be due and payable.  A default could also require the immediate repayment of outstanding obligations under other debt facilities or agreements that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.  If that were to occur, we might not have available funds to satisfy such repayment obligations.Intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarksWe have a significant amount of intangible assets such as goodwill and trademarks and may acquire more intangible assets in the future.  Intangible assets are subject to a periodic impairment evaluation under applicable accounting standards.  The write-down of any of these intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.Changes to tax laws, fluctuations in our effective tax rate, accounting for tax positions and the resolution of tax disputes, and changes to accounting standards, elections or assertionsThe U.S. federal budget and individual state, provincial, local municipal budget deficits, or deficits in other governmental entities, could result in increased taxes on our products, business, customers or consumers.  Various proposals to increase taxes on beverage alcohol products have been made at the federal and state levels or at other governmental bodies in recent years.  Federal, state, provincial, local or foreign governmental entities may consider increasing taxes upon beverage alcohol products as they explore available alternatives for raising funds.On December 22, 2017, the TCJ Act was signed into law in the United States.  The changes in the TCJ Act are broad and complex and we continue to examine the impact the TCJ Act may have on our business and financial results.In addition, significant judgment is required to determine our effective tax rate and evaluate our tax positions.  Our provision for income taxes includes a provision for uncertain tax positions.  Fluctuations in federal, state, local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, may impact our effective tax rate and our financial results.  When tax matters arise, several years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved.  Unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase our effective tax rate and resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.Additional U.S. tax changes or in how international corporations are taxed, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, or changes to accounting standards, elections or assertions could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.19Table of ContentsSecurities measured at fair valueThe value of the warrants and convertible debt we hold in Canopy through our subsidiaries is subject to the volatility of the market price of Canopy’s common stock.  This volatility subjects our financial statements to volatility.  The market price of Canopy’s common stock has experienced significant volatility, and that volatility may continue in the future and may also be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors beyond the control of Canopy, or of us.  These factors include, but are not limited to:•actual or anticipated fluctuations in Canopy’s reported results of operations;•recommendations by securities analysts;•changes in the market valuations of companies in the industry in which Canopy operates;•announcement of developments and material events by Canopy or its competitors;•fluctuations in the costs of vital production materials and services;•addition or departure of Canopy executive officers or other key personnel;•news reports relating to trends, concerns, technological or competitive developments, regulatory changes and other related issues in Canopy’s industry or target markets;•regulatory changes affecting the cannabis industry generally and Canopy’s business and operations; and•administrative obligations associated with Health Canada requirements and compliance with all associated rules and regulations including, but not limited to, the Canadian Cannabis Act.We recently agreed to modify the terms of certain warrants we hold in Canopy which, if modified, would among other things extend the expiry of those warrants and extend the time period through which the value of those warrants and our financial statements are subject to the volatility of the market price of Canopy’s common stock.Canopy’s Corporate GovernanceCanopy’s business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that may from time to time increase both Canopy’s compliance costs and the risk of its non-compliance.  These include changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulated organizations, including, but not limited to, the Canadian Securities Administrators, the TSX, the International Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and the NYSE.  These rules continue to evolve in scope and complexity creating new requirements for Canopy.  Canopy is currently exempt from certain NYSE corporate governance requirements because it is a foreign private issuer listed on the NYSE and registered with the SEC and is subject to Canadian requirements.  When Canopy registered with the SEC, it did not need to test its internal control procedures to satisfy the requirements pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”) that require management of Canopy to perform an annual assessment of the effectiveness of Canopy’s internal control over financial reporting and its registered public accounting firm to provide an attestation report as to the effectiveness of such controls.  The future application of SOX to Canopy will require management of Canopy to perform an annual assessment of Canopy’s internal control over financial reporting and its registered public accounting firm to conduct an independent assessment of the effectiveness of such controls.  Canopy has disclosed a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting.  Canopy may not be able to remediate the material weakness timely.  Also, Canopy’s internal controls may not be adequate, or Canopy may not be able to maintain adequate internal controls as required by SOX.  Canopy may not be able to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis if standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time.  If Canopy does not satisfy SOX requirements on an ongoing and timely basis, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of its financial statements, which could harm Canopy’s business and have a negative impact on the trading price or market value of Canopy securities.Other RisksDamage to our reputationThe success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of those brands and maintaining a good reputation is critical to selling our branded products.  Contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for 20Table of Contentsour brands, could adversely affect their sales and our reputation.  Our reputation could also be impacted negatively by public perception, adverse publicity (whether or not valid), negative comments in social media, or our responses relating to:•a perceived failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental standards for all our operations and activities;•a perceived failure to address concerns relating to the quality, safety or integrity of our products;•allegations that we, or persons associated with us or formerly associated with us, have violated applicable laws or regulations, including but not limited to those related to safety, employment, discrimination, harassment, whistle-blowing, privacy, or cyber-security;•our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, packaging, water and energy use, and waste management; or•efforts that are perceived as insufficient to promote the responsible use of alcohol or cannabis.Failure to comply with federal, state, or local laws and regulations, maintain an effective system of internal controls, provide accurate and timely financial statement information, or protect our information systems against service interruptions, misappropriation of data or breaches of security, could also hurt our reputation.  Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation, competitive position and brand equity.Class action or other litigation relating to abuse of our products, the misuse of our products, product liability, or marketing or sales practicesThere has been public attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry, which we believe is due to concern over problems related to harmful use of alcohol, including drinking and driving, underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol.  We could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability or marketing or sales practices.  Adverse developments in lawsuits concerning these types of matters or a significant decline in the social acceptability of beverage alcohol products that may result from lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.Control by the Sands FamilyOur Class B Common Stock is principally held by members of the Sands family, either directly or through entities controlled by members of the Sands family.  Holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to 10 votes per share.  Holders of Class 1 Common Stock generally do not have voting rights.  The stock ownership of the Sands family and entities controlled by members of the Sands family represents a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our common stock as of April 17, 2019, voting as a single class.  Consequently, the Sands family has the power to elect a majority of our directors and approve actions requiring the approval of the stockholders of the Company voting as a single class"
8,STZ,CONSTELLATION BRANDS,2018-04-23,"Risk Factors
.In addition to information discussed elsewhere in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.  The risks described below are not the only risks we face.  Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations in future periods.Operational RisksInternational operations, worldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions, geopolitical uncertainty, or changes to international trade agreements and tariffs, import and excise duties, other taxes, or other governmental rules and regulationsOur products are produced and sold in numerous countries, we have employees in various countries and we have production facilities currently in the U.S., Mexico, New Zealand, Italy and Canada.10Table of ContentsRisks associated with international operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations, include:•changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions;•potential disruption from socio-economic violence, including terrorism and drug-related violence;•restrictions on foreign ownership and investments or on repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;•import and export requirements;•currency exchange rate fluctuations;•a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment in some countries, which, among other things, can create uncertainty regarding contract enforcement, intellectual property rights and liability issues; and•inadequate levels of compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.Unfavorable global or regional economic conditions, including economic slowdown, inflation, and the disruption, volatility and tightening of credit and capital markets, as well as unemployment, tax increases, governmental spending cuts or a return of high levels of inflation, could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our products.  These could also create or exacerbate credit issues, cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and our suppliers, distributors, retailers and consumers.  The inability of suppliers, distributors and retailers to access liquidity could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products.We are also exposed to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.  We could experience changes in our ability to manage fluctuations in interest rates and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reducing those risks.We could also be affected by nationalization of our international operations, unstable governments, unfamiliar or biased legal systems or intergovernmental disputes.  Any determination that our operations or activities did not comply with applicable U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, interruptions of business, terminations of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal and equitable sanctions.The U.S. and other countries in which we operate impose import and excise duties, tariffs, and other taxes on beverage alcohol products in varying amounts.  The U.S. federal government or other governmental bodies may propose changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, taxes and other government rules and regulations.  Significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on beverage alcohol products could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.In addition, federal, state, provincial, local and foreign governmental agencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol products industry concerning such matters as licensing, warehousing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and required labeling, advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers.  Certain federal, state or local regulations also require warning labels and signage.  New or revised regulations or increased licensing fees, requirements or taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.  Additionally, various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products because of what our products contain or allegations that our products cause adverse health effects.  If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our major products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products.These international, economic and political uncertainties and regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations, especially to the extent these matters, or the decisions, policies or economic strength of our suppliers and distributors, affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.11Table of ContentsDependence on limited facilities for production of our Mexican beer brands, and expansion and construction issuesWe are dependent on our Nava and Obregon breweries as our sole sources of supply to fulfill our Mexican beer brands product requirements, both now as well as for the near term.We are currently expanding our Nava and Obregon breweries and constructing our Mexicali Brewery, and our joint venture with Owens-Illinois is expanding its glass plant.  While these multi-million-dollar expansion and construction activities are progressing consistent with our plans, there is always the potential risk of completion delays and cost overruns.Expansion of current production facilities and construction of new production facilities are subject to various regulatory and developmental risks, including but not limited to: (i)  our ability to obtain timely certificate authorizations, necessary approvals and permits from regulatory agencies and on terms that are acceptable to us; (ii)  potential changes in federal, state and local statutes and regulations, including environmental requirements, that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project; (iii)  inability to acquire rights-of-way or land or water rights on a timely basis on terms that are acceptable to us; and (iv)  inability to acquire the necessary energy supplies, including electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel.  Any of these events could delay the expansion or construction of our production facilities.We may not be able to satisfy our product supply requirements for the Mexican beer brands in the event of a significant disruption, partial destruction or total destruction of the Nava or Obregon breweries or the glass plant.  Also, if the contemplated expansions of the Nava and Obregon breweries and glass plant and construction of the Mexicali Brewery are not completed by their targeted completion dates, we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of our Mexican beer to satisfy our needs.  Under such circumstances, we may be unable to obtain our Mexican beer at a reasonable price from another source, if at all.  A significant disruption at our Nava or Obregon breweries, or the glass plant, even on a short-term basis, could impair our ability to produce and ship products to market on a timely basis.  Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.Operational disruptions or catastrophic loss to breweries, wineries, other production facilities or distribution systemsAll of our Mexican beer brands product supply is currently produced at our breweries in Nava, Coahuila, Mexico and Obregon, Sonora, Mexico.  Many of the workers at these breweries are covered by collective bargaining agreements.  In addition, three of our largest wineries in the U.S. produce approximately 60% of our total annual wine and spirits product volume globally.  The glass plant currently produces approximately 40% of the total annual glass bottle supply for our Mexican beer brands.  Several of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities, including certain California wineries and breweries and our planned Mexicali Brewery, are in areas prone to seismic activity.  Additionally, we have various vineyards, wineries and breweries in the state of California which has recently experienced wildfires and landslides.If any of these or other of our properties and production facilities were to experience a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss, it could delay or disrupt production, shipments and revenue, and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace these properties.  Also, our production facilities are asset intensive.  As our operations are concentrated in a limited number of production and distribution facilities, we are more likely to experience a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss in any one location from acts of war or terrorism, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, labor strike or other labor activities, cyber-attacks and other attempts to penetrate our information technology systems, unavailability of raw or packaging materials, or other natural or man-made events.  If a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations could be adversely affected due to higher maintenance charges, unexpected capital spending or product supply constraints.12Table of ContentsOur insurance policies do not cover certain types of catastrophes.  Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain property damage and business interruption insurance.  If our insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at greater risk that we may experience an adverse impact to our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.  If one or more significant uninsured or under-insured events occur, we could suffer a major financial loss.Supply of quality water, agricultural and other raw materials, certain raw materials and packaging materials purchased under short-term supply contracts, limited group of suppliers of glass bottlesThe quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of our agricultural raw materials and our ability to operate our business.  Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe, there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints.  We are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of our breweries, our wineries and our distilleries, as well as to irrigate our vineyards and conduct our other operations.  The suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their vineyards and fields.  If water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarcer or the quality of that water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints.  In addition, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of our production facilities and vineyards.  A substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines or other crops, such as barley or hops, which could lead to a shortage of our product supply.We have substantial wine operations as well as brewery operations in the state of California and substantial brewery operations in the country of Mexico.  Although certain areas in California recently experienced flooding, the state had endured an extended period of drought and instituted restrictions on water usage.  A recurrence of severe drought conditions in California could have an adverse effect upon those operations, which effect could become more significant depending upon actual future drought conditions.  Our Nava Brewery and glass plant receive water originating from a mountain aquifer.  Our Obregon Brewery receives its allocation of water originating from an aquifer and we expect our Mexicali Brewery will receive an allocation of water originating from an aquifer.  Although we anticipate our operations will have adequate sources of water to support their on-going requirements, there is no guarantee that the sources of water, methods of water delivery, or water requirements will not change materially in the future.Our breweries, the glass plant, our wineries and our distilleries use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce their products.  These include corn starch and sugars, malt, hops, fruits, yeast and water for our breweries; soda ash and silica sand for the glass plant; grapes and water for our wineries; and grain and water for our distilleries.  Our breweries, wineries and distilleries all use large amounts of various packaging materials, including glass, aluminum, cardboard and other paper products.  Our production facilities also use electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel in their operations.  Certain raw materials and packaging materials are purchased under contracts of varying maturities.  The supply and price of raw materials, packaging materials and energy can be affected by many factors beyond our control, including market demand, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices), droughts and other weather conditions or natural or man-made events, economic factors affecting growth decisions, inflation, plant diseases and theft.Our breweries, wineries and distilleries are also dependent upon an adequate supply of glass bottles.  Glass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold.  We currently have a small number of suppliers of glass bottles for our Mexican beer brands.  In the U.S., glass bottles have only a small number of producers.  Currently, one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our U.S. wine and spirits operations and two producers supply our glass bottles for our craft beer.To the extent any of the foregoing factors increases the costs of our finished products or lead to a shortage of our product supply, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.13Table of ContentsReliance on wholesale distributors, major retailers and government agenciesLocal market structures and distribution channels vary worldwide.  Within our primary market in the U.S., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the beer, wine and spirits categories, with separate distribution networks utilized for our beer portfolio and our wine and spirits portfolio.  In the U.S., we sell our products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets and directly to government agencies, and we have entered into exclusive arrangements with certain wholesalers that generate a large portion of our U.S. wine and spirits net sales.  Wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which compete directly with our products for retail shelf space, promotional support and consumer purchases, and wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products of our competitors.  The replacement or poor performance of our major wholesalers, retailers or government agencies could result in temporary or longer-term sales disruptions or could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.Reliance upon complex information systems and third party global networks, cyber-attacks, and design or implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system (ERP)We depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers and suppliers, as well as maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and effect accurate and timely governmental reporting.  If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach, or penalties associated with the failure to timely file governmental reports.  We recognize that many groups on a world-wide basis have experienced increases in security breaches, cyber-attacks, and other hacking activities such as denial of service, malware, and ransomware.  As with all large information technology systems, our systems could be penetrated by increasingly sophisticated outside parties’ intent on extracting confidential or proprietary information, corrupting our information, disrupting our business processes, or engaging in the unauthorized use of strategic information about us or our employees, customers or consumers.  Such unauthorized access could disrupt our operations and could result in the loss of assets or revenues, litigation, remediation costs, damage to our reputation, or the failure by us to retain or attract customers following such an event.We have outsourced various functions to third-party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future.  We rely on those third-party service providers to provide services on a timely and effective basis.  However, we do not ultimately control their performance.  Their failure to perform as expected or as required by contract could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations.We are in the process of a multi-year implementation of a new ERP system which we intend to replace our existing operating and financial systems.  We are designing the ERP system to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to our management team related to the operation of the business.  We expect the implementation process will require the investment of significant personnel and financial resources.  Companies which implement new ERP systems may experience delays, increased costs and other difficulties.  If we are not successful in designing and implementing our ERP system as planned or if it does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected, or our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed.To the extent any of the foregoing factors result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations, or reduce the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.Contamination and degradation of product quality from diseases, pests and weather conditionsOur success depends upon the positive image that consumers have of our brands and of the safety and quality of our products.  Contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our brands, could adversely affect their sales.  Various diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, drought, frosts and certain other weather conditions could affect the quality and quantity of barley, hops, grapes and other agricultural raw materials available, decreasing the supply and quality of our products.  We cannot guarantee that our grape suppliers or our suppliers of other agricultural raw materials will 14Table of Contentssucceed in preventing contamination in existing vineyards or fields or that we will succeed in preventing contamination in our existing vineyards or future vineyards we may acquire.  Future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in growing grapes or other agricultural raw materials may increase vineyard costs and/or reduce production of grapes or other crops.  It is also possible that a supplier may not provide materials or product components which meet our required standards or may falsify documentation associated with the fulfillment of those requirements.Product contamination or tampering or the failure to maintain our standards for product quality, safety and integrity, including with respect to raw materials, naturally occurring compounds, packaging materials or product components obtained from suppliers, may also reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.  Contaminants or other defects in raw materials, packaging materials or product components purchased from third parties and used in the production of our beer, wine or spirits products or defects in the fermentation or distillation process could lead to low beverage quality as well as illness among, or injury to, consumers of our products and may result in reduced sales of the affected brand or all our brands.If any of our products become unsafe or unfit for consumption, are misbranded, or cause injury, we may have to engage in a product recall and/or be subject to liability and incur additional costs.  A widespread product recall, multiple product recalls, or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period, which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity.Climate change and environmental regulatory complianceOur business depends upon agricultural activity and natural resources.  There has been much public discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters.  Severe weather events, such as drought or flooding in California or a prolonged cold winter in New York, and climate change may negatively affect agricultural productivity in the regions from which we presently source our various agricultural raw materials.  Decreased availability of our raw materials may increase the cost of goods for our products.  Severe weather events or changes in the frequency or intensity of weather events can also disrupt our supply chain, which may affect production operations, insurance cost and coverage, as well as delivery of our products to wholesalers, retailers and consumers.  Natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes may also negatively impact the ability of consumers to purchase our products. We may experience significant future increases in the costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance, including fees, licenses, and the cost of capital improvements for our operating facilities to meet environmental regulatory requirements.  In addition, we may be party to various environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of our business or relating to historical activities of businesses we acquire.  Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants in our current and former properties, the potential exists for remediation, liability and indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs that we have estimated.  We may incur costs associated with environmental compliance arising from events we cannot control, such as unusually severe floods, hurricanes, earthquakes or fires.  We cannot assure you that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our projections or otherwise have a material adverse effect upon our business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.Strategic RisksCompetitionWe are in a highly competitive industry and our sales could be negatively affected by numerous factors including:•our inability to maintain or increase prices;•new entrants in our market or categories;•the decision of wholesalers, retailers or consumers to purchase competitors’ products instead of ours; or•a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption due to consumer dietary preference changes or consumers substituting legalized marijuana or other similar products in lieu of beverage alcohol.15Table of ContentsSales could also be affected by pricing, purchasing, financing, operational, advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers, state and other local agencies, and retailers which could affect their supply of, or consumer demand for, our products.  We could also experience higher than expected selling, general and administrative expenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising or marketing expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasons.  We cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase our prices to pass along to our customers any increased costs we incur.Potential decline in the consumption of products we sell; dependence on sales of our Mexican beer brandsOur business depends upon consumers’ consumption of our beer, wine and spirits brands, and sales of our Mexican beer brands in the U.S. are a significant portion of our business.  Accordingly, a decline in the growth rate, amount or profitability of our sales of the Mexican beer brands in the U.S. could adversely affect our business.  Further, consumer preferences and tastes may shift due to, among other reasons, changing taste preferences, demographics or perceived value.  Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences and taste in our major markets away from our premium beer, wine and spirits brands, and our Mexican beer brands in particular, from the categories in which they compete could have a negative impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.  Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including changes in demographic or social trends, public health policies, and changes in leisure, dining and beverage consumption patterns.  A limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including:•a general decline in economic or geopolitical conditions;•concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and driving;•a general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in on-premise establishments, such as may result from stricter laws relating to driving while under the influence of alcohol;•the increased activity of anti-alcohol groups;•increased federal, state, provincial and foreign excise or other taxes on beverage alcohol products and possible restrictions on beverage alcohol advertising and marketing;•increased regulation placing restrictions on the purchase or consumption of beverage alcohol products or increasing prices due to the imposition of duties or excise tax or changes to international trade agreements or tariffs;•inflation; and•wars, pandemics, weather and natural or man-made disasters.Acquisition, divestiture, investment, and new product development strategiesFrom time to time, we acquire businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe will provide a strategic fit with our business.  We integrate acquired businesses with our existing operations; our overall internal control over financial reporting processes; and our financial, operations and information systems.  If the financial performance of our business, as supplemented by the assets and businesses acquired, does not meet our expectations, it may make it more difficult for us to service our debt obligations and our results of operations may fail to meet market expectations.  We may not effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or within the anticipated costs or timeframes, retain key customers and suppliers or key employees of acquired businesses, or successfully implement our business plan for the combined business.  In addition, our final determinations and appraisals of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates and we may fail to realize fully anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities or other potential synergies.  We cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses or investments will remain constant.We may also divest ourselves of businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe no longer provide a strategic fit with our business.  We may provide various indemnifications in connection with the divestiture of businesses or assets.16Table of ContentsWe have also acquired or retained ownership interests in companies which we do not control, such as our joint venture to operate a glass plant adjacent to our Nava Brewery and investments recently made through our Constellation Ventures function.  Our joint venture partners or the other parties that hold the remaining ownership interests in companies which we do not control may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint ventures or those companies.  Our joint venture arrangements and the arrangements through which we acquired or hold our other equity or membership interests may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs, to make capital investments, to fulfill alone our joint venture partners’ obligations, or to purchase other parties’ interests. We have also recently invested in a Canadian company that manufactures and supplies medicinal cannabis.  While we will not develop, distribute, manufacture or sell cannabis products in the U.S., or anywhere else in the world, unless it is legally permissible to do so at all governmental levels in the particular jurisdiction, this investment could affect consumer perception of our existing brands and our reputation with various constituencies.In addition, our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products.  The launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain, especially with respect to consumer appeal.  The launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and an unsuccessful launch, among other things, can affect consumer perception of existing brands and our reputation.  Unsuccessful implementation or short-lived popularity of our product innovations may result in inventory write-offs and other costs.We cannot assure you that we will realize the expected benefits of acquisitions, divestitures or investments.  We also cannot assure you that our acquisitions, investments or joint ventures will be profitable or that forecasts regarding acquisition, divestiture or investment activities will be accurate.  Our failure to adequately manage the risks associated with acquisitions or divestitures, or the failure of an entity in which we have an equity or membership interest, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.Dependence upon trademarks and proprietary rights, failure to protect our intellectual property rightsOur future success depends significantly on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights.  We have been granted numerous trademark registrations covering our brands and products and have filed, and expect to continue to file, trademark applications seeking to protect newly-developed brands and products.  We cannot be sure that trademark registrations will be issued with respect to any of our trademark applications.  We could also, by omission, fail to timely renew or protect a trademark and our competitors could challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us.Financial RisksIndebtednessWe have incurred indebtedness to finance acquisitions, fund beer operations expansion and construction activities and repurchase shares of our common stock.  In the future, we may continue to incur additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions, repurchase shares of our stock and fund other general corporate purposes, including beer operations expansion and construction activities.  We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet all our debt service requirements, pay dividends, repurchase shares of our common stock, and fund our general corporate and capital requirements.Our current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have important consequences.  These consequences include, or may include, the following:•our ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or acquisitions or other purposes may be limited;•our funds available for operations, expansions and construction, dividends or other distributions, or stock repurchases may be reduced because we dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;17Table of Contents•our ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants; and•our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than less leveraged competitors and, thus, our ability to withstand competitive pressures may be limited.Additionally, any failure to meet required payments on our debt, or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt, could result in an event of default under the terms of those instruments and a downgrade to our credit ratings.  A downgrade in our credit ratings would increase our borrowing costs and could affect our ability to issue commercial paper.  Certain of our debt facilities also contain change of control provisions which, if triggered, may result in an acceleration of our obligation to repay the debt.If we fail to comply with the obligations contained in our senior credit facility, our existing or future indentures, or other loan agreements, we could be in default under such debt facilities or agreements.  In the event of a default, the holders of our debt could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such instrument to be due and payable.  A default could also require the immediate repayment of outstanding obligations under other debt facilities or agreements that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.  If that were to occur, we might not have available funds to satisfy such repayment obligations.Intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarksWe have a significant amount of intangible assets such as goodwill and trademarks and may acquire more intangible assets in the future.  Intangible assets are subject to a periodic impairment evaluation under applicable accounting standards.  The write-down of any of these intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.Changes to tax laws, fluctuations in our effective tax rate, accounting for tax positions and the resolution of tax disputes, and changes to accounting standards, elections or assertionsThe U.S. federal budget and individual state, provincial, local municipal budget deficits, or deficits in other governmental entities, could result in increased taxes on our products, business, customers or consumers.  Various proposals to increase taxes on beverage alcohol products have been made at the federal and state levels or at other governmental bodies in recent years.  Federal, state, provincial, local or foreign governmental entities may consider increasing taxes upon beverage alcohol products as they explore available alternatives for raising funds.On December 22, 2017, the TCJ Act was signed into law in the United States.  The changes in the TCJ Act are broad and complex and we continue to examine the impact the TCJ Act may have on our business and financial results.  We recorded a provisional net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 associated with the enactment of the TCJ Act.  This provisional benefit is subject to change, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in estimates, interpretations and assumptions we have made, and additional guidance and interpretations from the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS or other standard-setting bodies, legislative actions, changes in accounting standards or related interpretations in response to the TCJ Act, and future actions by states within the United States that have not currently adopted the TCJ Act.In addition, significant judgment is required to determine our effective tax rate and evaluate our tax positions.  Our provision for income taxes includes a provision for uncertain tax positions.  Fluctuations in federal, state, local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, may impact our effective tax rate and our financial results.  When tax matters arise, several years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved.  Unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase our effective tax rate and resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.Additional U.S. tax changes or in how international corporations are taxed, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, or changes to accounting standards, elections or assertions could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.18Table of ContentsOther RisksDamage to our reputationThe success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of those brands and maintaining a good reputation is critical to selling our branded products.  Contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our brands, could adversely affect their sales and our reputation.  Our reputation could also be impacted negatively by public perception, adverse publicity (whether or not valid), negative comments in social media, or our responses relating to:•a perceived failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental standards for all our operations and activities;•a perceived failure to address concerns relating to the quality, safety or integrity of our products;•allegations that we, or persons associated with us or formerly associated with us, have violated applicable laws or regulations, including but not limited to those related to safety, employment, discrimination, harassment, whistle-blowing, privacy, or cyber-security;•our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, packaging, water and energy use, and waste management; or•efforts that are perceived as insufficient to promote the responsible use of alcohol or cannabis.Failure to comply with federal, state, or local laws and regulations, maintain an effective system of internal controls, provide accurate and timely financial statement information, or protect our information systems against service interruptions, misappropriation of data or breaches of security, could also hurt our reputation.  Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation, competitive position and brand equity.Class action or other litigation relating to abuse of our products, the misuse of our products, product liability, or marketing or sales practicesThere has been public attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry, which we believe is due to concern over problems related to harmful use of alcohol, including drinking and driving, underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol.  We could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability or marketing or sales practices.  Adverse developments in lawsuits concerning these types of matters or a significant decline in the social acceptability of beverage alcohol products that may result from lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.Control by the Sands FamilyOur Class B Common Stock is principally held by members of the Sands family, either directly or through entities controlled by members of the Sands family.  Holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to 10 votes per share.  Holders of Class 1 Common Stock generally do not have voting rights.  The stock ownership of the Sands family and entities controlled by members of the Sands family represents a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our common stock as of April 17, 2018, voting as a single class.  Consequently, the Sands family has the power to elect a majority of our directors and approve actions requiring the approval of the stockholders of the Company voting as a single class"
1,STZ,CONSTELLATION BRANDS,2017-04-27,"Risk Factors
.In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  The risks described below are not the only risks we face.  Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.International operations, currency rate fluctuations, interest rate fluctuations and geopolitical uncertaintyOur products are produced and sold in numerous countries throughout the world, we have employees in various countries throughout the world and we have production facilities currently in the U.S., Mexico, New Zealand, Italy and Canada.Risks associated with international operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, include:•changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions;•potential disruption from socio-economic violence, including terrorism and drug-related violence;•restrictions on foreign ownership and investments or on repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;•changes in laws, governmental regulations and policies in the U.S. and in many countries outside the U.S., including changes in tax laws and regulations;•import and export requirements;•currency exchange rate fluctuations;•a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment in some countries, which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues;•laws regarding the enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights;10Table of Contents•inadequate levels of compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and•other challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences.Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to overcome the challenges we encounter with respect to these factors and other matters generally affecting U.S. companies with international operations.  Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including anti-corruption and privacy laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, business partners or agents will not violate our policies or take action determined to be in violation of the law.  Any determination that our operations or activities did not comply with applicable U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, interruptions of business, terminations of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal and equitable sanctions.We are also exposed to risks associated with currency fluctuations and risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.  Currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies in the markets in which we do business have fluctuated in recent years and are likely to continue to do so in the future.  We manage our exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risks utilizing derivative instruments and other means to reduce those risks.  We could experience changes in our ability to hedge against or manage fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reducing those risks.  We could also be affected by nationalization of our international operations, unstable governments, unfamiliar or biased legal systems or intergovernmental disputes.  These currency, economic and political uncertainties may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, especially to the extent these matters, or the decisions, policies or economic strength of our suppliers and distributors, affect our international operations.CompetitionWe are in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and unit volume of our sales could be negatively affected by numerous factors including:•our inability to maintain or increase prices, particularly in our beer business;•new entrants in our market or categories;•a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption; or•the decision of wholesalers, retailers or consumers to purchase a competitor’s product instead of ours.Unit volume and dollar amount of sales could also be affected by pricing, purchasing, financing, operational, advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers, state and provincial agencies, and retailers which could affect their supply of, or consumer demand for, our products.  We could also experience higher than expected selling, general and administrative expenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising or marketing expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasons.Worldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditionsWe are subject to risks associated with adverse economic conditions, including economic slowdown, inflation, and the disruption, volatility and tightening of credit and capital markets.  Unfavorable global or regional economic conditions could adversely impact our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.  Unemployment, tax increases, governmental spending cuts or a return of high levels of inflation could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our products.  These could also create or exacerbate credit issues, cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and our suppliers, distributors, retailers and consumers.  The inability of suppliers, distributors and retailers to access liquidity could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products.  We have a committed credit facility and additional liquidity facilities available to us.  While to date we have not experienced problems with accessing these facilities, to the extent that the financial institutions that participate in these facilities were to default on their obligation to fund, those funds would not be available to us.11Table of ContentsDependence on sales of our Mexican beer brandsSales of our Mexican beer brands in the U.S. are a significant portion of our business.  Accordingly, a decline in the growth rate, amount or profitability of our sales of the Mexican beer brands in the U.S. could adversely affect our business.  Further, consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from the Mexican beer brands, the categories in which they compete, or beer generally due to, among other reasons, changing taste preferences, demographics or perceived value.  Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences and taste away from the Mexican beer brands, or from the categories in which they compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition and results of operations.Supply of Mexican beer brandsIn order to fulfill our current and projected Mexican beer brands product requirements, we are currently dependent on our Nava Brewery located in Nava, Coahuila, Mexico and our Obregon Brewery located in Obregon, Sonora, Mexico.  Although we are in the process of optimizing our Obregon Brewery and constructing an additional brewery in Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico, our Nava Brewery and our Obregon Brewery are currently our sole source of supply for our Mexican beer brands.  The Nava Brewery currently has the capacity to fill approximately 80% of our current product requirements with the balance able to be filled by our Obregon Brewery.Our supply of Mexican beer brands is also dependent upon an adequate supply of glass bottles.  We formed the Mexican glass plant joint venture which acquired and is expanding the glass plant adjacent to our Nava Brewery in order to increase bottle output to support increased production at our Nava Brewery.We may not be able to satisfy all of our product supply requirements for the Mexican beer brands in the event of a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the Nava Brewery or the Obregon Brewery.  Also, if the contemplated Nava Brewery and glass plant expansions, Obregon Brewery optimization and Mexicali Brewery construction activities are not completed by their targeted completion dates, we may not be able to produce sufficient Mexican beer brands to satisfy our needs.  Under such circumstances, we may be unable to obtain Mexican beer brands at a reasonable price from another source, if at all.  A significant disruption at our Nava Brewery or our Obregon Brewery, even on a short-term basis, could impair our ability to produce and ship products to market on a timely basis.  Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, any of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.  Similarly, although we have additional sources of supply of glass bottles, a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the Mexican glass plant or the failure of the joint venture to complete the glass plant expansion could impair our ability to bottle and ship our Mexican beer products to market.  Additionally, our general insurance policies may not cover certain types of catastrophes that might affect our supply of the Mexican beer brands.  A major uninsured catastrophe could result in significant unrecoverable losses.Expansion issues, construction issues and operational disruptionsWe are currently expanding our Nava Brewery, optimizing our Obregon Brewery and constructing our Mexicali Brewery and our joint venture with Owens-Illinois is expanding the glass plant.  While these multi-million dollar expansion and construction activities are progressing consistent with our plans, there is always the potential risk of completion delays and cost overruns.Expansion and optimization of current production facilities and construction of new production facilities are subject to various regulatory and developmental risks, including but not limited to: (i)  our ability to obtain timely certificate authorizations, necessary approvals and permits from regulatory agencies and on terms that are acceptable to us; (ii)  potential changes in federal, state and local statutes and regulations, including environmental requirements, that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project; (iii)  inability to acquire rights-of-way or land or water rights on a timely basis on terms that are acceptable to us; and (iv)  inability to acquire the necessary energy supplies, including electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel.  Any of these events could delay the expansion, construction or optimization of our production facilities.12Table of ContentsMany of our production facilities, such as our breweries, wineries, distilleries and the glass plant are asset intensive.  Our profitability could be affected by operational disruption of any of our production or bottling lines or the glass furnace.  In such event we may experience an adverse effect to our business operations and profitability due to higher maintenance charges, unexpected capital spending or product supply constraints.Supply of quality water, agricultural and other raw materials, certain raw materials and packaging materials purchased under short-term supply contracts, limited group of suppliers of glass bottlesThe quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of our agricultural raw materials and our ability to operate our business.  Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe, there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints.  We are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of our breweries, our wineries and our distilleries, as well as to irrigate our vineyards and conduct our other operations.  The suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their vineyards and fields.We have substantial wine operations in the state of California.  Although certain areas in California have recently experienced flooding, the state had endured an extended period of drought and instituted restrictions on water usage.  While we have undertaken a number of water saving initiatives and we currently believe we have sufficient water available for our California vineyards and wineries, a recurrence of severe drought conditions in California could have an adverse effect upon those operations, which effect could become more significant depending upon actual future drought conditions.  Our Nava Brewery and the glass plant receive water originating from a mountain aquifer.  Our Obregon Brewery receives its allocation of water originating from an aquifer and we expect our Mexicali Brewery will receive an allocation of water originating from an aquifer.  Although we anticipate our breweries and the glass plant will receive water adequate to support their on-going requirements, including as a result of the anticipated optimization and expansions, there is no guarantee that the water available to them, our expectations as to the source of water, methods of water delivery, or their water requirements will not change materially in the future.Growing agricultural raw materials also requires adequate water supplies.  If water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarcer or the quality of that water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.  Even if quality water is widely available, including to our breweries, our wineries, our distilleries and our vineyards, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of our production facilities and vineyards.  A substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines or other crops, which could lead to a shortage of our product supply.  Any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our breweries, the glass plant, our wineries and our distilleries also use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce their products.  As to the Nava Brewery and the Obregon Brewery, these include corn starch, malt, hops and water; the glass plant uses large amounts of soda ash and silica sand; the Ballast Point breweries use large amounts of malt, hops, yeast and water, as well as corn sugars, spices and fruits; the wineries use large amounts of grapes and water; and the distilleries use large amounts of grain and water.  Our breweries, our wineries and our distilleries all use large amounts of various packaging materials, including glass, aluminum, cardboard and other paper products.  Our production facilities, including the glass plant, also use a significant amount of energy in their operations, including electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel.  Certain raw materials and packaging materials are purchased under contracts of varying maturities.  The supply and price of raw materials, packaging materials and energy can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices), droughts and other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, inflation, plant diseases and theft.  To the extent any of the foregoing factors, including supply of goods and energy, affect the prices of ingredients or packaging or we do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks, or are unable to recoup costs through increases in the price of our finished products, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.13Table of ContentsGlass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold.  We currently have a small number of suppliers of glass bottles for our Mexican beer brands.  In the U.S., glass bottles have only a small number of producers.  Currently, one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our U.S. wine and spirits operations and a different supplier supplies our glass bottles for our craft beer.  The inability of any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements could adversely affect our business.Catastrophic loss to wineries, production facilities or distribution systemsThroughout the years, we have consolidated several of our winery and production facility operations.  Approximately 80% of our total annual wine and spirits product volume is produced in the U.S., and three of our largest wineries are the Woodbridge Winery in Acampo, CA, the Canandaigua Winery in Canandaigua, NY, and the Mission Bell Winery in Madera, CA.  These three facilities produce approximately 40.6 million cases (or approximately 75% of our U.S. production) which is approximately 60% of the total annual Constellation wine and spirits product volume globally.  Currently, our entire Mexican beer brands product supply is produced at our breweries in Nava, Coahuila, Mexico and Obregon, Sonora, Mexico.Additionally, many of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities, such as our California wineries, our Lodi Distribution Center in Lodi, CA, certain of our Ballast Point operations, and our planned Mexicali Brewery are located in areas which are prone to seismic activity.  If any of these vineyards and facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace the vineyard or facility.  If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.  In addition, since we have consolidated certain of our operations and various production and distribution facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption of our operations in the event of a catastrophic event in any one location, such as through acts of war or terrorism, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other natural or man-made disasters.  Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, certain catastrophes are not covered by our insurance policies as we believe this to be a prudent financial decision.  Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain insurance.  If our insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at greater risk that we may experience an adverse impact to our financial results.  We take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by a catastrophic event, but there is no certainty that our efforts would prove successful.  If one or more significant uninsured events occur, we could suffer a major financial loss.Changes to international trade agreements and tariffs, changes to accounting standards, elections or assertions, changes to tax laws, changes to import and excise duties or other taxes or other governmental rules and regulations, including significant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations in the marketing or sale of our products, and accounting for tax positions and the resolution of tax disputesThe U.S. and other countries in which we operate impose import and excise duties, tariffs, and other taxes on beverage alcohol products in varying amounts which are subject to change.  Significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on beverage alcohol products could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.  The U.S. federal budget and individual state, provincial or local municipal budget deficits could result in increased taxes on our products, business, customers or consumers.  Various proposals to increase taxes on beverage alcohol products have been made at the federal and state or provincial level in recent years.  Many U.S. states have considered proposals to increase, and some of these states have increased, state alcohol excise taxes.  There may be further consideration by federal, state, provincial, local and foreign governmental entities to increase taxes upon beverage alcohol products as governmental entities explore available alternatives for raising funds during the current macroeconomic climate.Comments made during the course of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign and subsequent to the election indicate that the U.S. federal government may propose changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, taxes and other government rules and regulations.  The current U.S. administration has indicated that tax reform is among its top priorities and the U.S. Congress is reviewing and may, in the future, review tax legislation proposals.  While we 14Table of Contentscannot predict what changes will actually occur with respect to any of these items, such changes could affect our business and results of operations.In addition, federal, state, provincial, local and foreign governmental agencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol products industry concerning such matters as licensing, warehousing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and required labeling, advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers.  Certain federal, state or provincial regulations also require warning labels and signage.  New or revised regulations or increased licensing fees, requirements or taxes could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  Additionally, various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products as a result of what they contain or allegations that they cause adverse health effects.  If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our major products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products.We may also make various accounting elections or assertions or change accounting elections or assertions that we have previously made.  Our accounting elections or assertions or changes to our accounting elections or assertions are affected by various business factors which, collectively, may have an impact on our financial results or our effective tax rate.Additionally, significant judgment is required to determine our effective tax rate and evaluate our tax positions.  We provide for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement criteria prescribed by applicable accounting standards.  Fluctuations in federal, state, local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, may impact our effective tax rate and our financial results.  When tax matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved.  Unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.  Any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.IndebtednessIn recent years, we have incurred substantial indebtedness to finance acquisitions such as our acquisition of Ballast Point, The Prisoner Wine Company brand portfolio, the Charles Smith wines collection, High West, and the Obregon Brewery, fund the Beer Business Acquisition, expand our Nava Brewery and begin construction of our Mexicali Brewery, expand the glass plant, and repurchase shares of our common stock.  In the future, we may continue to incur substantial additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions, repurchase shares of our stock and fund other general corporate purposes, including the Nava Brewery and glass plant expansions, Obregon Brewery optimization and Mexicali Brewery construction.  We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet all our debt service requirements, to pay dividends, to repurchase shares of our common stock, and to fund our general corporate and capital requirements.Our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance.  We do not have complete control over our future operating performance because it is subject to prevailing economic conditions, levels of interest rates and financial, business and other factors.Our current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have important consequences.  These consequences include, or may include, the following:•our ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or acquisitions or other purposes may be limited;•our funds available for operations, expansions, dividends or other distributions, or stock repurchases may be reduced because we dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;•our ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants; and•our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than less leveraged competitors and, thus, our ability to withstand competitive pressures may be limited.15Table of ContentsRestrictive covenants in our senior credit facility and in our indentures place limits on our ability to conduct our business.  Covenants in our senior credit facility include those that restrict our ability to make acquisitions, incur debt, encumber or sell assets, pay dividends, engage in mergers and consolidations, enter into transactions with affiliates, make investments and permit our subsidiaries to enter into certain restrictive agreements.  It additionally contains certain financial covenants, including a net debt coverage ratio test and an interest coverage ratio test.  Covenants in our indentures are generally less restrictive than those in our senior credit facility but nevertheless, among other things, limit our ability under certain circumstances to create liens or enter into sale-leaseback transactions and impose conditions on our ability to engage in mergers, consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.These agreements also contain certain change of control provisions which, if triggered, may result in an acceleration of our obligation to repay the debt.  If we fail to comply with the obligations contained in the senior credit facility, our existing or future indentures or other loan agreements, we could be in default under such agreements, which could require us to immediately repay the related debt and also debt under other agreements that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.Potential decline in the consumption of products we sellWe rely on consumers’ demand for our products.  Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including changes in demographic or social trends, public health policies, and changes in leisure, dining and beverage consumption patterns.  Our continued success will require us to anticipate and respond effectively to shifts in consumer behavior and drinking tastes.  If consumer preferences were to move away from our premium brands, including our Mexican beer brands, in any of our major markets, our financial results might be adversely affected.While over the past several years there have been modest increases in the overall consumption of beverage alcohol and fluctuations in per capita consumption within categories of beverage alcohol, there have been periods in the past in which there were sequential declines in the overall per capita consumption of certain beverage alcohol product categories in the U.S. and other markets in which we participate.  A limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including:•a general decline in economic or geopolitical conditions;•concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and driving;•a general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in on-premise establishments, such as may result from smoking bans and stricter laws relating to driving while under the influence of alcohol;•a decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products as a result of consumers substituting legalized marijuana or other similar products in lieu of our products;•consumer dietary preferences favoring lighter, lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks, sports drinks and water products;•the increased activity of anti-alcohol groups;•increased federal, state, provincial and foreign excise or other taxes on beverage alcohol products and possible restrictions on beverage alcohol advertising and marketing;•increased regulation placing restrictions on the purchase or consumption of beverage alcohol products or increasing prices due to the imposition of duties or excise tax or changes to international trade agreements or tariffs;•inflation; and•wars, pandemics, weather and natural or man-made disasters.In addition, our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products.  The launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain especially with regard to their appeal to consumers.  The launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and an unsuccessful launch, among other things, can affect consumer perception of existing brands and our reputation.  Unsuccessful implementation or short-lived popularity of our product innovations may result in inventory write-offs and other costs.16Table of ContentsAcquisition, divestiture and joint venture strategyWe have made a number of acquisitions and divestitures and may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business.  Recently, these have included the Meiomi wine brand, the Ballast Point craft beer business, The Prisoner Wine Company brand portfolio, the Charles Smith Wines collection, High West, and the Obregon Brewery, as well as various minority investments by our Constellation Ventures function.  We will need to integrate acquired businesses with our existing operations; our overall internal control over financial reporting processes; and our financial, operations and information systems.  If the financial performance of our business, as supplemented by the assets and businesses acquired, does not meet our expectations, it may make it more difficult for us to service our debt obligations and our results of operations may fail to meet market expectations.  We may also divest ourselves of businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe no longer provide a strategic fit with our business.  For example, we recently sold our Canadian wine business.  We may be obligated to provide certain services on a transitional basis to divested operations.  We cannot assure you that we will realize the expected benefits of divestitures.We cannot assure you that we will realize the expected benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures, such as revenue, earnings or operating efficiency, and we may not effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframes.  Complications with on-going integration of any acquisition or joint venture, including our Obregon Brewery acquisition or the glass plant joint venture, could result from the following circumstances, among others:•failure to implement our business plan for the combined business;•unanticipated issues in integrating, migrating or changing manufacturing, logistics, information, communications, financial, internal control and other systems;•failure to retain key customers and suppliers;•unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;•failure to retain key employees;•operating risks inherent in the acquired businesses and assets and our business;•dependency upon the operational experience of employees who are relatively new to our organization;•unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities;•failure to realize fully anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities and other potential synergies; and•unfamiliarity with operating new locations.Our joint venture to operate a glass plant adjacent to our Nava Brewery is fully consolidated into our financial results and the entire output of that facility is being utilized to support our Mexican beer business and the production at our Nava Brewery.  The integration of the Mexican glass plant can be further impacted by the following circumstances:•we share control of the joint venture with Owens-Illinois and while Owens-Illinois has deep experience running glass plants, we are not as experienced in that particular business; and•the ability of the joint venture to expand the glass plant capacity as planned in order to support the future growth of our beer business.If any of these circumstances were to occur with respect to any of our acquisitions, including our Beer Business Acquisition or the joint venture’s acquisition of the glass plant, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.We may provide various indemnifications in connection with the sale of assets or portions of our business.  Additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates.  We cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses will remain constant.We have entered into various joint ventures and we may enter into additional joint ventures for other purposes and with other parties.  We share control of our joint ventures.  We have also acquired or retained 17Table of Contentsownership interests in companies which we do not control, such as investments recently made through our Constellation Ventures function, such as our minority interests in  Nelson’s Green Brier Tennessee Whiskey, The Bardstown Bourbon Company, Catoctin Creek Distilling Company, and Crafthouse Cocktails.  Our joint venture partners or the other parties that hold the remaining ownership interests in companies which we do not control may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint ventures or those companies.  Our joint venture arrangements and the arrangements through which we acquired or hold our other equity or membership interests may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs, to make capital investments, to fulfill alone our joint venture partners’ obligations, or to purchase other parties’ interests.  Even though we share control of our glass plant joint venture, that joint venture’s financial results are consolidated into our financial results.  Our failure to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisition, or the failure of an entity in which we have an equity or membership interest, could adversely affect our financial condition or our valuation of these types of investments.We cannot assure you that any of our acquisitions, investments or joint ventures will be profitable or that forecasts regarding acquisition, divestiture, joint venture or investment activities will be accurate.Reliance on wholesale distributors, major retailers and government agenciesLocal market structures and distribution channels vary worldwide.  Within our primary market in the U.S., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the imported beer, craft beer, branded wine and spirits categories, with separate distribution networks utilized for our imported and craft beer portfolios and our wine and spirits portfolio.  In the U.S., we sell our products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets including grocery stores, club and discount stores, package liquor stores and restaurants and also directly to government agencies and we have entered into exclusive arrangements with certain wholesalers that generate a large portion of our U.S. wine and spirits sales.  The replacement or poor performance of our major wholesalers, retailers or government agencies could result in temporary or longer-term sales disruptions or could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition for a particular period.  Our inability to collect accounts receivable from our major wholesalers, retailers or government agencies could also materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the wholesale and retail distribution channels, particularly in the U.S.  If we are unable to adapt successfully to this changing environment, our net income, market share and volume growth could be negatively affected.  In addition, wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which compete directly with our products for retail shelf space, promotional support and consumer purchases.  Accordingly, wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products of our competitors.Reliance upon complex information systems and third party global networksWe depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers and suppliers, as well as maintain financial accuracy and efficiency.  If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach.  We recognize that many groups on a world-wide basis have experienced increases in cyber attacks and other hacking activity.  We have dedicated internal and external resources to review and address such threats.  However, as with all large information technology systems, our systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting confidential or proprietary information, corrupting our information, disrupting our business processes, or engaging in the unauthorized use of strategic information about us or our employees, customers or consumers.  Such unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in the loss of assets or revenues, litigation, remediation costs, damage to our reputation, or the failure by us to retain or attract customers following such an event.  Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.We have outsourced various functions to third-party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future.  We rely on those third-party service providers to provide services on a timely and effective basis.  Although we believe we have robust service level agreements with such third parties, closely monitor their 18Table of Contentsperformance and maintain contingency plans in case they are unable to perform as agreed, we do not ultimately control their performance.  Their failure to perform as expected or as required by contract could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow, and could impair our ability to make required filings with various reporting agencies on a timely or accurate basis.Damage to our reputationMaintaining a good reputation is critical to selling our branded products.  Product contamination or tampering or the failure to maintain our standards for product quality, safety and integrity, including with respect to raw materials, naturally occurring compounds, packaging materials or product components obtained from suppliers, may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.  Although we maintain standards for the materials and product components we receive from our suppliers, and we also audit our suppliers’ compliance with our standards, it is possible that a supplier may not provide materials or product components which meet our required standards or may falsify documentation associated with the fulfillment of those requirements.  If any of our products becomes unsafe or unfit for consumption, is misbranded or causes injury, we may have to engage in a product recall and/or be subject to liability and incur additional costs.  A widespread product recall, multiple product recalls, or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period of time, which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity.  Our reputation could be impacted negatively by public perception, adverse publicity (whether or not valid), negative comments in social media, or our responses relating to:•a perceived failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities;•a perceived failure to address concerns relating to the quality, safety or integrity of our products;•our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, packaging, water and energy use, and waste management; or•effects that are perceived as insufficient to promote the responsible use of alcohol.Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls, to provide accurate and timely financial statement information, or to protect our information systems against service interruptions, misappropriation of data or breaches of security, could also hurt our reputation.  Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation, competitive position and brand equity.ContaminationThe success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of those brands.  Contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our brands, could adversely affect their sales.  Contaminants in raw materials, packaging materials or product components purchased from third parties and used in the production of our beer, wine or spirits products or defects in the fermentation or distillation process could lead to low beverage quality as well as illness among, or injury to, consumers of our products and may result in reduced sales of the affected brand or all of our brands.Dependence upon trademarks and proprietary rights, failure to protect our intellectual property rightsOur future success depends significantly on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights.  We have been granted numerous trademark registrations covering our brands and products and have filed, and expect to continue to file, trademark applications seeking to protect newly-developed brands and products.  We cannot be sure that trademark registrations will be issued with respect to any of our trademark applications.  There is also a risk that we could, by omission, fail to timely renew or protect a trademark or that our competitors will challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us.19Table of ContentsIntangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarksWe continue to have a significant amount of intangible assets such as goodwill and trademarks and may acquire more intangible assets in the future.  Intangible assets are subject to a periodic impairment evaluation under applicable accounting standards.  The write-down of any of these intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our net income.Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate changeOur business depends upon agricultural activity and natural resources.  There has been much public discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters.  Severe weather events, such as drought or flooding in California or a prolonged cold winter in New York, and climate change may negatively affect agricultural productivity in the regions from which we presently source our various agricultural raw materials.  Decreased availability of our raw materials may increase the cost of goods for our products.  Severe weather events or changes in the frequency or intensity of weather events can also disrupt our supply chain, which may affect production operations, insurance cost and coverage, as well as delivery of our products to wholesalers, retailers and consumers.Various diseases, pests and certain weather conditionsVarious diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, drought, frosts and certain other weather conditions could affect the quality and quantity of barley, hops, grapes and other agricultural raw materials available, decreasing the supply of our products and negatively impacting profitability.  We cannot guarantee that our grape suppliers or our suppliers of other agricultural raw materials will succeed in preventing contamination in existing vineyards or fields or that we will succeed in preventing contamination in our existing vineyards or future vineyards we may acquire.  Future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in growing grapes or other agricultural raw materials may increase vineyard costs and/or reduce production of grapes or other crops.Cost of energy or environmental regulatory complianceWe have experienced increases in energy costs in the past, and energy costs could rise in the future, which would result in higher transportation, freight and other operating costs.  We may experience significant future increases in the costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance, including fees, licenses, and the cost of capital improvements to our operating facilities in order to meet environmental regulatory requirements.  Our future operating expenses and margins will be dependent on our ability to manage the impact of cost increases.  We cannot guarantee that we will be able to pass along increased energy costs or increased costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance to our customers through increased prices.In addition, we may be party to various environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of our business or in connection with historical activities of businesses we acquire.  Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants in our current and former properties, the potential exists for remediation, liability and indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs that we have estimated.  We may incur cost associated with environmental compliance arising from events we cannot control, such as unusually severe floods, hurricanes or earthquakes.  We cannot assure you that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our projections or otherwise have an adverse effect upon our business reputation, financial condition or results of operations.Control by the Sands FamilyOur Class B Common Stock is principally held by members of the Sands family, either directly or through entities controlled by members of the Sands family.  Holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to 10 votes per share.  Holders of Class 1 Common Stock generally do not have voting rights.  The stock ownership of the Sands family and entities controlled by members of 20Table of Contentsthe Sands family represents a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our common stock as of April 21, 2017, voting as a single class.  Consequently, the Sands family has the power to elect a majority of our directors and approve actions requiring the approval of the stockholders of the Company voting as a single class.Benefit cost increases and labor relationsOur profitability is affected by employee medical costs and other employee benefits.  In recent years, employee medical costs have increased due to factors such as the increase in health care costs in the U.S.  These factors are expected to continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance due to higher employee benefit costs.  Although we actively seek to control increases in employee benefit costs and encourage employees to maintain healthy lifestyles to reduce future potential medical costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases.  Continued employee benefit cost increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We believe our subsidiaries have good working relations with their employees.  However, if their employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, they could experience an operational disruption and/or experience higher on-going labor costs which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Class action or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse, the misuse of alcohol, product liability, or marketing or sales practicesThere has been public attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry, which we believe is due to concern over problems related to harmful use of alcohol, including drinking and driving, underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol.  We also could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability or marketing or sales practices.  Adverse developments in lawsuits concerning these types of matters or a significant decline in the social acceptability of beverage alcohol products that may result from lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business"
3,STZ,CONSTELLATION BRANDS,2016-04-25,"Risk Factors
.In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  The risks described below are not the only risks we face.  Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.Worldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditionsWe are subject to risks associated with adverse economic conditions, including economic slowdown, inflation, and the disruption, volatility and tightening of credit and capital markets.  Unfavorable global or regional economic conditions could adversely impact our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.  Unemployment, tax increases, governmental spending cuts or a return of high levels of inflation could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our products.  These could also create or exacerbate credit issues, cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and our suppliers, distributors, retailers and consumers.  The inability of suppliers, distributors and retailers to access liquidity could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products.  We have a committed credit facility and additional liquidity facilities available to us.  While to date we have not experienced problems with accessing these facilities, to the extent that the financial institutions that participate in these facilities were to default on their obligation to fund, those funds would not be available to us.Global operations, currency rate fluctuations, interest rate fluctuations and geopolitical uncertaintyOur products are produced and sold in numerous countries throughout the world.  As a result of the Beer Business Acquisition, we also have operations in Mexico.Risks associated with international operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, include:•changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions;•potential disruption from socio-economic violence, including terrorism and drug-related violence;•restrictions on foreign ownership and investments or on repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;•changes in laws, governmental regulations and policies in many countries outside the U.S.;•changes in tax laws and regulations, including with respect to income taxes in countries outside the U.S.;•import and export requirements;•currency exchange rate fluctuations;•a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment, which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues;•laws regarding the enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights;11Table of Contents•inadequate levels of compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and•other challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences.Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to overcome the challenges we encounter with respect to these factors and other matters generally affecting U.S. companies with global operations.  Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, business partners or agents will not violate our policies or take action determined to be in violation of the law.  Any determination that our operations or activities were not in compliance with applicable U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, interruptions of business, terminations of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal and equitable sanctions.We are also exposed to risks associated with currency fluctuations and risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.  Currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies in the markets in which we do business have fluctuated in recent years and are likely to continue to do so in the future.  We manage our exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risks utilizing derivative instruments and other means to reduce those risks.  We could experience changes in our ability to hedge against or manage fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reducing those risks.  We could also be affected by nationalization of our international operations, unstable governments, unfamiliar or biased legal systems or intergovernmental disputes.  These currency, economic and political uncertainties may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, especially to the extent these matters, or the decisions, policies or economic strength of our suppliers and distributors, affect our global operations.CompetitionWe are in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and unit volume of our sales could be negatively affected by numerous factors including:•our inability to maintain or increase prices;•new entrants in our market or categories;•a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption; or•the decision of wholesalers or consumers to purchase a competitor’s product instead of ours.Unit volume and dollar amount of sales could also be affected by pricing, purchasing, financing, operational, advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers, state and provincial agencies, and retailers which could affect their supply of, or consumer demand for, our products.  We could also experience higher than expected selling, general and administrative expenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising or marketing expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasons.Dependence on sales of our Mexican Beer BrandsSince the Beer Business Acquisition, sales of the Mexican Beer Brands in the U.S. have become a more significant portion of our business.  Accordingly, if the growth rate, amount or profitability of our sales of the Mexican Beer Brands in the U.S. declines, our business could be more adversely affected than as compared to a time prior to the Beer Business Acquisition.  Further, consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from the Mexican Beer Brands, the categories in which they compete, or beer generally due to, among other reasons, changing taste preferences, demographics or perceived value.  Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences and taste away from the Mexican Beer Brands, or from the categories in which they compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition and results of operations.Supply of Mexican Beer BrandsIn order to fulfill our current and projected Mexican Beer Brands product requirements, we are currently dependent on our Nava Brewery which is a single facility located in Nava, Coahuila, Mexico, and an interim supply agreement for our supply of Mexican Beer Brands through June 2017.  Although we are in the process of 12Table of Contentsconstructing an additional brewery in Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico with the first phase targeted for completion in calendar 2019, our Nava Brewery may for a period of time become our sole source of supply for our Mexican Beer Brands.  The Nava Brewery currently has the capacity to fill approximately 60% of our current product requirements and before the end of calendar 2016 its capacity is expected to increase to allow it to fill approximately 80% of our projected product requirements.  We are in the process of further expanding the Nava Brewery's capacity over a three-year period.  The first phase, which was intended to make us self-sufficient, is targeted to be complete in calendar 2016.  The second phase to support further growth in the business is targeted for completion in calendar 2017, and the third phase, to support additional growth of the business, is targeted for completion in calendar 2018.  In 2013, we entered into an interim supply agreement for a supply of additional Mexican Beer Brands products for an initial period of three years.  This agreement also provides for up to two one-year extensions.  However, the United States, acting though the DOJ, will have a right of approval, in its sole discretion, of any extension of the term of this interim supply agreement beyond three years.  The term of this interim supply agreement has been extended for one additional year as to a select number of products to ensure additional supply beyond the initial Nava expansion to support the robust growth levels of our Mexican Beer portfolio and continue a smooth transition as we ramp up incremental capacity.  The interim supply agreement will now expire in June 2017.  There can be no assurance that any additional requested extension would be granted.Our Nava Brewery supply is also dependent upon an adequate supply of glass bottles.  We formed the Mexican glass plant joint venture which acquired the glass plant adjacent to our Nava Brewery.  The Mexican glass plant joint venture plans to expand production of the glass plant facility by early calendar 2018 in order to increase bottle output to support increased production at our Nava Brewery.We may not be able to satisfy all of our product supply requirements for the Mexican Beer Brands in the event of a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the Nava Brewery or our interim supplier’s breweries.  Also, if the contemplated initial expansion of our Nava Brewery is not completed within three years after consummation of the Beer Business Acquisition, and the additional incremental expansions of the Nava Brewery and construction of the Mexicali Brewery to support further growth of our business are not completed by their targeted completion dates, we may not be able to produce sufficient Mexican Beer Brands to satisfy our needs.  Under such circumstances, we may be unable to obtain Mexican Beer Brands at a reasonable price from another source, if at all.  A significant disruption at our Nava Brewery or at our supplier’s breweries, even on a short-term basis, could impair our ability to produce and ship products to market on a timely basis.  Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, any of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.  Similarly, although we have additional sources of supply of glass bottles, a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the joint venture’s Mexican glass plant or the failure of the joint venture to complete the glass plant expansion could impair our ability to bottle and ship our Mexican beer products to market.  Additionally, our general insurance policies may not cover certain types of catastrophes that might affect our supply of the Mexican Beer Brands.  A major uninsured catastrophe could result in significant unrecoverable losses.Supply of quality water, agricultural and other raw materials, certain raw materials and packaging materials purchased under short-term supply contracts, limited group of suppliers of glass bottlesThe quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of our agricultural raw materials and our ability to operate our business.  Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe, there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints.  We are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of our breweries, our wineries and our distillery, as well as to irrigate our vineyards and conduct our other operations.  The suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their vineyards and fields.We have substantial wine operations in the state of California, which has endured an extended period of drought and has instituted restrictions on water usage.  While we have undertaken a number of water saving initiatives and we currently believe we have sufficient water available for our California vineyards and wineries, continued or more severe drought conditions in California could have an adverse effect upon those operations, which effect could become more significant depending upon actual future drought conditions.  Our Nava Brewery 13Table of Contentsand the glass plant receive water originating from a mountain aquifer.  Although we anticipate our breweries and the glass plant will receive water adequate to support their on-going requirements, including as a result of the anticipated expansions, there is no guarantee that the water available to them or their water requirements will not change materially in the future.If water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarcer or the quality of that water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.  Even if quality water is widely available, including to our breweries, our wineries, our distillery and our vineyards, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of our production facilities and vineyards.  Any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our breweries, the glass plant, our wineries and our distillery also use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce their products.  As to the Nava Brewery, these include corn starch, malt, hops and water; the glass plant uses large amounts of soda ash and silica sand; the Ballast Point breweries use large amounts of malt, hops, yeast and water, as well as corn sugars, spices and fruits; the wineries use large amounts of grapes and water; and the distillery uses large amounts of grain and water.  Our breweries, our wineries and our distillery all use large amounts of various packaging materials, including glass, aluminum, cardboard and other paper products.  Our production facilities, including the glass plant, also use a significant amount of energy in their operations, including electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel.  Certain raw materials and packaging materials are purchased under contracts of varying maturities.  The supply and price of raw materials, packaging materials and energy can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices), droughts and other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, inflation, plant diseases and theft.  To the extent any of the foregoing factors, including supply of goods and energy, affect the prices of ingredients or packaging or we do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks, or are unable to recoup costs through increases in the price of our finished products, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.Glass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold.  We currently have a small number of suppliers of glass bottles for our Mexican Beer Brands.  In the U.S. and Canada, glass bottles have only a small number of producers.  Currently, one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our U.S. operations and a portion of our glass container requirements for our Canadian operations, with the remaining portion of our glass container requirements for our Canadian operations supplied by another producer.  The inability of any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements could adversely affect our business.Catastrophic loss to wineries, production facilities or distribution systemsThroughout the years, we have consolidated several of our winery and production facility operations.  Approximately 80% of our total annual wine and spirits product volume is produced in the US, and three of our largest wineries are the Woodbridge Winery in Acampo, CA, the Mission Bell Winery in Madera, CA, and the Canandaigua Winery in Canandaigua, NY.  These three facilities produce approximately 36 million cases (or approximately 70% of our US production) which is approximately 55% of the total annual Constellation wine and spirits product volume globally.  Additionally, many of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities, such as our California wineries, our Lodi Distribution Center in Lodi, CA, and our planned Mexicali Brewery are located in areas which are prone to seismic activity.  If any of these vineyards and facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace the vineyard or facility.  If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.  In addition, since we have consolidated certain of our operations and various production and distribution facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption of our operations in the event of a catastrophic event in any one location, such as through acts of war or terrorism, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other natural or man-made disasters.  Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, certain catastrophes are not covered by our insurance policies as we believe this to be a prudent financial decision.  Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain insurance.  If our insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may 14Table of Contentsbe at greater risk that we may experience an adverse impact to our financial results.  We take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by a catastrophic event, but there is no certainty that our efforts would prove successful.  If one or more significant uninsured events occur, we could suffer a major financial loss.Expansion issues, construction issues and operational disruptionsWe are currently expanding our Nava Brewery and constructing our Mexicali Brewery and our joint venture with Owens-Illinois is expanding the glass plant.  While these multi-million dollar expansion and construction activities are progressing consistent with our plans, there is always the potential risk of completion delays and cost overruns.  Our supply of Mexican Beer Brands would be negatively impacted if a serious delay in these expansion or construction activities were to occur, leading to a negative impact upon our results of operation and financial condition.Expansion of current production facilities and construction of new production facilities required to support future growth is subject to various regulatory and developmental risks, including but not limited to: (i) our ability to obtain timely certificate authorizations, necessary approvals and permits from regulatory agencies and on terms that are acceptable to us; (ii) potential changes in federal, state and local statutes and regulations, including environmental requirements, that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project; (iii) inability to acquire rights-of-way or land or water rights on a timely basis on terms that are acceptable to us; and (iv) inability to acquire the necessary energy supplies, including electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel.Many of our production facilities, such as our breweries, wineries and distillery, and the Mexican glass plant held by the joint venture with Owens-Illinois are asset intensive.  Our profitability could be affected by operational disruption of any of our production or bottling lines or the glass furnace.  In such event we may experience an adverse effect to our business operations and profitability due to higher maintenance charges, unexpected capital spending or product supply constraints.Acquisition, divestiture and joint venture strategyWe have made a number of acquisitions and divestitures and may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business.  Recently, these have included the Meiomi wine brand, the Ballast Point craft beer business and our agreement to acquire The Prisoner Wine Company brand portfolio.  We may also divest ourselves of businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe no longer provide a strategic fit with our business.  We will need to integrate acquired businesses with our existing operations; our overall internal control over financial reporting processes; and our financial, operations and information systems.  If the financial performance of our business, as supplemented by the assets and businesses acquired, does not meet our expectations, it may make it more difficult for us to service our debt obligations and our results of operations may fail to meet market expectations.We cannot assure you that we will realize the expected benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures, such as revenue, earnings or operating efficiency, and we may not effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframes.  Complications with on-going integration of any acquisition or joint venture, including our Beer Business Acquisition or the acquisition of a Mexican glass plant by our joint venture with Owens-Illinois, could result from the following circumstances, among others:•failure to implement our business plan for the combined business;•unanticipated issues in integrating, migrating or changing manufacturing, logistics, information, communications, financial, internal control and other systems;•failure to retain key customers and suppliers;•unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;•failure to retain key employees;•operating risks inherent in the acquired businesses and assets and our business;•unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities;•failure to realize fully anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities and other potential synergies; and•unfamiliarity with operating new locations.15Table of ContentsThe integration of the Beer Business Acquisition can be further impacted by the following circumstances:•Mexican brewery operations will be dependent upon the operational experience of employees who are relatively new to our organization; •our ability to secure or expand Mexican brewery capacity beyond the initial Nava Brewery expansion, both incremental Nava Brewery expansions and construction of the Mexicali Brewery in order to support future growth of our beer business; and•failure to expand the Nava Brewery under the timeline imposed by the DOJ pursuant to the final judgment.Our joint venture with Owens-Illinois to operate a glass plant adjacent to our Nava Brewery is fully consolidated into our financial results and the entire output of that facility will be utilized to support our Mexican beer business and the production at our Nava Brewery.  The integration of the Mexican glass plant acquisition can be further impacted by the following circumstances:•we share control of the joint venture with Owens-Illinois and while Owens-Illinois has deep experience running glass plants, we are not as experienced in that particular business;•glass plant operations will be dependent upon the operational experience of employees who are relatively new to our organization; and•the ability of the joint venture to expand the glass plant capacity as planned in order to support the future growth of our beer business.If any of these circumstances were to occur with respect to any of our acquisitions, including our Beer Business Acquisition or the Mexican glass plant joint venture’s acquisition of the glass plant, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.We may provide various indemnifications in connection with the sale of assets or portions of our business.  Additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates.  We cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses will remain constant.We have entered into joint ventures such as our Mexican glass plant joint venture with Owens-Illinois and we may enter into additional joint ventures for other purposes and with other parties.  We share control of our joint ventures.  We have also acquired or retained ownership interests in companies which we do not control, such as investments recently made through our Constellation Ventures function, such as our minority interests in Crafthouse Cocktails and Nelson’s Green Brier Tennessee Whiskey.  Our joint venture partners or the other parties that hold the remaining ownership interests in companies which we do not control may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint ventures or those companies.  Similarly, in 2016, we announced that we are evaluating the merits of executing an initial public offering of a portion of our Canadian wine business.  Our joint venture arrangements and the arrangements through which we acquired or hold our other equity or membership interests may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs, to make capital investments, to fulfill alone our joint venture partners’ obligations, or to purchase other parties’ interests.  Even though we share control of our Mexican glass plant joint venture, the financial results of that joint venture are consolidated into our financial results.  Our failure to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisition, or the failure of an entity in which we have an equity or membership interest, could adversely affect our financial condition or our valuation of these types of investments.We cannot assure you that any of our acquisitions, investments or joint ventures will be profitable or that forecasts regarding acquisition, divestiture, joint venture or investment activities will be accurate.IndebtednessIn recent years, we have incurred substantial indebtedness to finance acquisitions such as our acquisition of Ballast Point, repurchase shares of our common stock and fund the Beer Business Acquisition.  In the future, we may continue to incur substantial additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions, repurchase shares of our stock and 16Table of Contentsfund other general corporate purposes, including our Nava Brewery expansions, our Mexicali Brewery construction and expansion of the glass plant held through the Mexican glass plant joint venture.  We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet all of our debt service requirements, to pay dividends and to fund our general corporate and capital requirements.Our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance.  We do not have complete control over our future operating performance because it is subject to prevailing economic conditions, levels of interest rates and financial, business and other factors.Our current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have important consequences.  These consequences include, or may include, the following:•our ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or acquisitions or other purposes may be limited;•our funds available for operations, expansions, dividends or other distributions may be reduced because we dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;•our ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants; and•our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than less leveraged competitors and, thus, our ability to withstand competitive pressures may be limited.Restrictive covenants in our senior credit facility and in our indentures place limits on our ability to conduct our business.  Covenants in our senior credit facility include those that restrict our ability to make acquisitions, incur debt, encumber or sell assets, pay dividends, engage in mergers and consolidations, enter into transactions with affiliates, make investments and permit our subsidiaries to enter into certain restrictive agreements.  It additionally contains certain financial covenants, including a net debt coverage ratio test and an interest coverage ratio test.  Covenants in our indentures are generally less restrictive than those in our senior credit facility but nevertheless, among other things, limit our ability under certain circumstances to create liens or enter into sale-leaseback transactions and impose conditions on our ability to engage in mergers, consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.These agreements also contain certain change of control provisions which, if triggered, may result in an acceleration of our obligation to repay the debt.  If we fail to comply with the obligations contained in the senior credit facility, our existing or future indentures or other loan agreements, we could be in default under such agreements, which could require us to immediately repay the related debt and also debt under other agreements that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.Potential decline in the consumption of products we sellWe rely on consumers’ demand for our products.  Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including changes in demographic or social trends, public health policies, and changes in leisure, dining and beverage consumption patterns.  Our continued success will require us to anticipate and respond effectively to shifts in consumer behavior and drinking tastes.  If consumer preferences were to move away from our premium brands, including our Mexican Beer Brands, in any of our major markets, our financial results might be adversely affected.While over the past several years there have been modest increases in consumption of beverage alcohol in most of our product categories and geographic markets, there have been periods in the past in which there were sequential declines in the overall per capita consumption of certain beverage alcohol product categories in the U.S. and other markets in which we participate.  A limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including:•a general decline in economic or geopolitical conditions;•concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and driving;17Table of Contents•a general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in on-premise establishments, such as may result from smoking bans and stricter laws relating to driving while under the influence of alcohol;•consumer dietary preferences favoring lighter, lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks, sports drinks and water products;•the increased activity of anti-alcohol groups;•increased federal, state, provincial and foreign excise or other taxes on beverage alcohol products and possible restrictions on beverage alcohol advertising and marketing;•increased regulation placing restrictions on the purchase or consumption of beverage alcohol products or increasing prices due to the imposition of duties or excise tax;•inflation; and•wars, pandemics, weather and natural or man-made disasters.In addition, our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products.  The launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain especially with regard to their appeal to consumers.  The launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and an unsuccessful launch, among other things, can affect consumer perception of existing brands and our reputation.  Unsuccessful implementation or short-lived popularity of our product innovations may result in inventory write-offs and other costs.Reliance on wholesale distributors, major retailers and government agenciesLocal market structures and distribution channels vary worldwide.  Within our primary market in the U.S., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the imported beer, craft beer, branded wine and spirits categories, with separate distribution networks utilized for our imported and craft beer portfolios and our wine and spirits portfolio.  In the U.S., we sell our products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets including grocery stores, club and discount stores, package liquor stores and restaurants and also directly to government agencies, while in Canada, we sell our products principally to government agencies.  In the U.S., we have entered into exclusive arrangements with certain wholesalers that generate a large portion of our U.S. wine and spirits sales.  The replacement or poor performance of our major wholesalers, retailers or government agencies could result in temporary or longer-term sales disruptions or could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition for a particular period.  Our inability to collect accounts receivable from our major wholesalers, retailers or government agencies could also materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the wholesale and retail distribution channels, particularly in the U.S.  If we are unable to adapt successfully to this changing environment, our net income, market share and volume growth could be negatively affected.  In addition, wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which compete directly with our products for retail shelf space, promotional support and consumer purchases.  Accordingly, wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products of our competitors.Reliance upon complex information systems and third party global networksWe depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers and suppliers, as well as maintain financial accuracy and efficiency.  If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach.  We recognize that many groups on a world-wide basis have experienced increases in cyber attacks and other hacking activity.  We have dedicated internal and external resources to review and address such threats.  However, as with all large information technology systems, our systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting confidential or proprietary information, corrupting our information, disrupting our business processes, or engaging in the unauthorized use of strategic information about us or our employees, customers or consumers.  Such unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in the loss of assets or revenues, litigation, remediation costs, damage to our reputation, or the failure by us to retain or attract customers following such an event.  Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.18Table of ContentsWe have outsourced various functions to third-party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future.  We rely on those third-party service providers to provide services on a timely and effective basis.  Although we believe we have robust service level agreements with such third parties, closely monitor their performance and maintain contingency plans in case they are unable to perform as agreed, we do not ultimately control their performance.  Their failure to perform as expected or as required by contract could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow, and could impair our ability to make required filings with various reporting agencies on a timely or accurate basis.In connection with the Beer Business Acquisition, we currently have the right to receive various services pursuant to our amended transition services agreement with ABI.  These currently include certain limited services which are available for the time periods as set forth in that transition services agreement, which include certain raw material supplies such as glass bottles and specialty malts.The failure of ABI (or any third party that ABI is permitted to outsource to) to perform as expected or as required by our contract or the glass plant joint venture’s contract could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations, and could also materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow, and could impair our ability to make required filings with various reporting agencies on a timely or accurate basis.Various diseases, pests and certain weather conditionsVarious diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, drought, frosts and certain other weather conditions could affect the quality and quantity of barley, hops, grapes and other agricultural raw materials available, decreasing the supply of our products and negatively impacting profitability.  We cannot guarantee that our grape suppliers or our suppliers of other agricultural raw materials will succeed in preventing contamination in existing vineyards or fields or that we will succeed in preventing contamination in our existing vineyards or future vineyards we may acquire.  Future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in growing grapes or other agricultural raw materials may increase vineyard costs and/or reduce production of grapes or other crops.  Growing agricultural raw materials also requires adequate water supplies.  A substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines or other crops, which could lead to a shortage of our product supply.Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate changeOur business depends upon agricultural activity and natural resources.  There has been much public discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters.  Severe weather events, such as drought in California or a prolonged cold winter in New York and Canada, and climate change may negatively affect agricultural productivity in the regions from which we presently source our various agricultural raw materials.  Decreased availability of our raw materials may increase the cost of goods for our products.  Severe weather events or changes in the frequency or intensity of weather events can also disrupt our supply chain, which may affect production operations, insurance cost and coverage, as well as delivery of our products to wholesalers, retailers and consumers.Control by the Sands FamilyOur Class B Common Stock is principally held by members of the Sands family, either directly or through entities controlled by members of the Sands family.  Holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to 10 votes per share.  Holders of Class 1 Common Stock generally do not have voting rights.  The stock ownership of the Sands family and entities controlled by members of the Sands family represents a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our common stock as of April 19, 2016, voting as a single class.  As a result, the Sands family has the power to elect a majority of our directors and approve actions requiring the approval of the stockholders of the Company voting as a single class.19Table of ContentsImport and excise duties or other taxes or government regulations, including significant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations in the marketing or sale of our productsThe U.S., Canada and other countries in which we operate impose import and excise duties and other taxes on beverage alcohol products in varying amounts which are subject to change.  Significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on beverage alcohol products could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.  The U.S. federal budget and individual state, provincial or local municipal budget deficits could result in increased taxes on our products, business, customers or consumers.  Various proposals to increase taxes on beverage alcohol products have been made at the federal and state or provincial level in recent years.  Many U.S. states have considered proposals to increase, and some of these states have increased, state alcohol excise taxes.  There may be further consideration by federal, state, provincial, local and foreign governmental entities to increase taxes upon beverage alcohol products as governmental entities explore available alternatives for raising funds during the current macroeconomic climate.  In addition, federal, state, provincial, local and foreign governmental agencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol products industry concerning such matters as licensing, warehousing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and required labeling, advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers.  Certain federal, state or provincial regulations also require warning labels and signage.  New or revised regulations or increased licensing fees, requirements or taxes could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  Additionally, various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products as a result of what they contain or allegations that they cause adverse health effects.  If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our major products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products.Damage to our reputationMaintaining a good reputation is critical to selling our branded products.  Product contamination or tampering or the failure to maintain our standards for product quality, safety and integrity, including with respect to raw materials, naturally occurring compounds, packaging materials or product components obtained from suppliers, may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.  Although we maintain standards for the materials and product components we receive from our suppliers, and we also audit our suppliers’ compliance with our standards, it is possible that a supplier may not provide materials or product components which meet our required standards or may falsify documentation associated with the fulfillment of those requirements.  If any of our products becomes unsafe or unfit for consumption, is misbranded or causes injury, we may have to engage in a product recall and/or be subject to liability and incur additional costs.  A widespread product recall, multiple product recalls, or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period of time, which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity.  Our reputation could be impacted negatively by public perception, adverse publicity (whether or not valid), negative comments in social media, or our responses relating to:•a perceived failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities;•a perceived failure to address concerns relating to the quality, safety or integrity of our products;•our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, packaging, water and energy use, and waste management; or•effects that are perceived as insufficient to promote the responsible use of alcohol.Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls, to provide accurate and timely financial statement information, or to protect our information systems against service interruptions, misappropriation of data or breaches of security, could also hurt our reputation.  Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation, competitive position and brand equity.20Table of ContentsContaminationThe success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of those brands.  Contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our brands, could adversely affect their sales.  Contaminants in raw materials, packaging materials or product components purchased from third parties and used in the production of our beer, wine or spirits products or defects in the fermentation or distillation process could lead to low beverage quality as well as illness among, or injury to, consumers of our products and may result in reduced sales of the affected brand or all of our brands.Dependence upon trademarks and proprietary rights, failure to protect our intellectual property rightsOur future success depends significantly on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights.  We have been granted numerous trademark registrations covering our brands and products and have filed, and expect to continue to file, trademark applications seeking to protect newly-developed brands and products.  We cannot be sure that trademark registrations will be issued with respect to any of our trademark applications.  There is also a risk that we could, by omission, fail to timely renew or protect a trademark or that our competitors will challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us.Cost of energy or environmental regulatory complianceWe have experienced increases in energy costs in the past, and energy costs could rise in the future, which would result in higher transportation, freight and other operating costs.  We may experience significant future increases in the costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance, including fees, licenses, and the cost of capital improvements to our operating facilities in order to meet environmental regulatory requirements.  Our future operating expenses and margins will be dependent on our ability to manage the impact of cost increases.  We cannot guarantee that we will be able to pass along increased energy costs or increased costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance to our customers through increased prices.In addition, we may be party to various environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of our business or in connection with historical activities of businesses we acquire.  Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants in our current and former properties, the potential exists for remediation, liability and indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs that we have estimated.  We cannot assure you that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our projections or otherwise have an adverse effect upon our business reputation, financial condition or results of operations.Intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarksWe continue to have a significant amount of intangible assets such as goodwill and trademarks and may acquire more intangible assets in the future.  Intangible assets are subject to a periodic impairment evaluation under applicable accounting standards.  The write-down of any of these intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our net income.Benefit cost increases and labor relationsOur profitability is affected by employee medical costs and other employee benefits.  In recent years, employee medical costs have increased due to factors such as the increase in health care costs in the U.S.  These factors, plus the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in March 2010, are expected to continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance due to higher employee benefit costs.  Although we actively seek to control increases in employee benefit costs and encourage employees to maintain healthy lifestyles to reduce future potential medical costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases.  Continued employee benefit cost increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.21Table of ContentsWe believe our subsidiaries have good working relations with their employees.  However, if their employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, they could experience an operational disruption and/or experience higher on-going labor costs which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Class action or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse, the misuse of alcohol, product liability, or marketing or sales practicesThere has been public attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry, which we believe is due to concern over problems related to harmful use of alcohol, including drinking and driving, underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol.  We also could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability or marketing or sales practices.  Adverse developments in lawsuits concerning these types of matters or a significant decline in the social acceptability of beverage alcohol products that may result from lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business"
10,STZ,CONSTELLATION BRANDS,2015-04-28,"Risk Factors
.In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  The risks described below are not the only risks we face.  Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.Worldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditionsWe are subject to risks associated with adverse economic conditions, including economic slowdown, inflation, and the disruption, volatility and tightening of credit and capital markets.  Unfavorable global or regional economic conditions could adversely impact our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.  Unemployment, tax increases, governmental spending cuts or a return of high levels of inflation could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our products.  These could also create or exacerbate credit issues, cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and our suppliers, distributors, retailers and consumers.  The inability of suppliers, distributors and retailers to access liquidity could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products.  We have a committed credit facility and additional liquidity facilities available to us.  While to date we have not experienced problems with accessing these facilities, to the extent that the financial institutions that participate in these facilities were to default on their obligation to fund, those funds would not be available to us.Global operations, currency rate fluctuations, interest rate fluctuations and geopolitical uncertaintyOur products are produced and sold in numerous countries throughout the world.  As a result of the Beer Business Acquisition, we also have operations in Mexico.10Table of ContentsRisks associated with international operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, include:•changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions;•potential disruption from socio-economic violence, including terrorism and drug-related violence;•restrictions on foreign ownership and investments or on repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;•changes in laws, governmental regulations and policies in many countries outside the U.S.;•import and export requirements;•currency exchange rate fluctuations;•a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment, which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues;•laws regarding the enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights;•inadequate levels of compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and•other challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences.Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to overcome the challenges we encounter with respect to these factors and other matters generally affecting U.S. companies with global operations.  Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, business partners or agents will not violate our policies or take action determined to be in violation of the law.  Any determination that our operations or activities were not in compliance with applicable U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, interruptions of business, terminations of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal and equitable sanctions.We are also exposed to risks associated with currency fluctuations and risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.  Currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies in the markets in which we do business have fluctuated in recent years and are likely to continue to do so in the future.  We manage our exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risks utilizing derivative instruments and other means to reduce those risks.  We could experience changes in our ability to hedge against or manage fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reducing those risks.  We could also be affected by nationalization of our international operations, unstable governments, unfamiliar or biased legal systems or intergovernmental disputes.  These currency, economic and political uncertainties may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, especially to the extent these matters, or the decisions, policies or economic strength of our suppliers and distributors, affect our global operations.CompetitionWe are in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and unit volume of our sales could be negatively affected by numerous factors including:•our inability to maintain or increase prices;•new entrants in our market or categories;•a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption; or•the decision of wholesalers or consumers to purchase a competitor’s product instead of ours.Unit volume and dollar amount of sales could also be affected by pricing, purchasing, financing, operational, advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers, state and provincial agencies, and retailers which could affect their supply of, or consumer demand for, our products.  We could also experience higher than expected selling, general and administrative expenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising or marketing expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasons.11Table of ContentsDependence on sales of our Mexican Beer BrandsSince the Beer Business Acquisition, sales of the Mexican Beer Brands in the U.S. have become a more significant portion of our business.  Accordingly, if the growth rate, amount or profitability of our sales of the Mexican Beer Brands in the U.S. declines, our business could be more adversely affected than as compared to a time prior to the Beer Business Acquisition.  Further, consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from the Mexican Beer Brands, the categories in which they compete, or beer generally due to, among other reasons, changing taste preferences, demographics or perceived value.  Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences and taste away from the Mexican Beer Brands, or from the categories in which they compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition and results of operations.Supply of Mexican Beer BrandsIn order to fulfill our current and projected Mexican Beer Brands product requirements, we are currently dependent on our Brewery which is a single facility located in Nava, Coahuila, Mexico, and an interim supply agreement for our supply of Mexican Beer Brands through calendar year 2016.  Although we are assessing options for additional capacity requirements and sources of supply after our Brewery expansions are completed, our Brewery may become our sole source of supply for our Mexican Beer Brands.  The Brewery currently has the capacity to fill approximately half of our current projected product requirements.  We are in the process of expanding the Brewery's capacity over a three-year period.  The first phase, which is intended to make us self-sufficient, is targeted to be complete in calendar year 2016.  The second phase to support further growth in the business is targeted for completion in calendar year 2017.  In 2013, we entered into an interim supply agreement for a supply of additional Mexican Beer Brands products for an initial period of three years.  This agreement also provides for up to two one-year extensions.  However, the United States, acting though the DOJ, will have a right of approval, in its sole discretion, of any extension of the term of this interim supply agreement beyond three years.  There can be no assurance that any requested extension would be granted.Our Brewery Supply is also dependent upon an adequate supply of glass bottles.  We recently formed the Mexican glass plant joint venture which acquired the glass plant adjacent to our Brewery.  The Mexican glass plant joint venture plans to expand production of the glass plant facility within the next four years in order to increase bottle output to support increased production at our Brewery.We may not be able to satisfy all of our product supply requirements for the Mexican Beer Brands in the event of a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the Brewery or our interim supplier’s breweries.  Also, if the contemplated expansion of our Brewery is not completed within three years after consummation of the Beer Business Acquisition, the Brewery may not be able to produce sufficient Mexican Beer Brands to satisfy our needs.  Under such circumstances, we may be unable to obtain Mexican Beer Brands at a reasonable price from another source, if at all.  A significant disruption at the Brewery or at our supplier’s breweries, even on a short-term basis, could impair our ability to produce and ship products to market on a timely basis.  Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, any of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.  Similarly, although we have additional sources of supply of glass bottles, a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the joint venture’s Mexican glass plant or the failure of the joint venture to complete the glass plant expansion could impair our ability to bottle and ship our Mexican beer products to market.  Additionally, our general insurance policies may not cover certain types of catastrophes that might affect our supply of the Mexican Beer Brands.  A major uninsured catastrophe could result in significant unrecoverable losses.Supply of quality water, agricultural and other raw materials, certain raw materials and packaging materials purchased under short-term supply contracts, limited group of suppliers of glass bottlesThe quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of our agricultural raw materials and our ability to operate our business.  Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe, there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints.  We are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of the Brewery, our wineries and our distillery, as well as to irrigate our vineyards and 12Table of Contentsconduct our other operations.  The suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their vineyards and fields.We have substantial wine operations in the state of California, which has endured an extended period of drought and has recently instituted restrictions on water usage.  While we have undertaken a number of water saving  initiatives and we currently believe we have sufficient water available for our California vineyards and wineries, continued or more severe drought conditions in California could have an adverse effect upon those operations, which effect could become more significant depending upon actual future drought conditions.  Our Brewery and the glass plant receive water originating from a mountain aquifer.  Although we anticipate the Brewery and the glass plant will receive water adequate to support their on-going requirements, including as a result of the anticipated expansions, there is no guarantee that the water available to them or their water requirements will not change materially in the future.If water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarcer or the quality of that water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.  Even if quality water is widely available, including to the Brewery, our wineries, our distillery and our vineyards, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of our production facilities and vineyards.  Any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.The Brewery, the glass plant, our wineries and our distillery also use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce their products.  As to the Brewery, these include corn starch, malt, hops and water; the glass plant uses large amounts of soda ash and silica sand; the wineries use large amounts of grapes and water; and the distillery uses large amounts of grain and water.  The Brewery, our wineries and our distillery all use large amounts of various packaging materials, including glass, aluminum, cardboard and other paper products.  Our production facilities, including the glass plant, also use a significant amount of energy in their operations, including electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel.  Certain raw materials and packaging materials are purchased under contracts of varying maturities.  The supply and price of raw materials, packaging materials and energy can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices), droughts and other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, inflation, plant diseases and theft.  To the extent any of the foregoing factors, including supply of goods and energy, affect the prices of ingredients or packaging or we do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks,or are unable to recoup costs through increases in the price of our finished products, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.Glass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold.  We have various suppliers of glass bottles for our Mexican Beer Brands.  In the U.S. and Canada, glass bottles have only a small number of producers.  Currently, one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our U.S. operations and a portion of our glass container requirements for our Canadian operations, with the remaining portion of our glass container requirements for our Canadian operations supplied by another producer.  The inability of any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements could adversely affect our business.Catastrophic loss to wineries, production facilities or distribution systemsThroughout the years, we have consolidated several of our winery and production facility operations.  Three of our largest wineries are the Woodbridge Winery in Acampo, CA, the Mission Bell Winery in Madera, CA, and the Canandaigua Winery in Canandaigua, NY.  These three facilities produce approximately 37.0 million cases (or approximately 58.2%) of our global wine and spirits product annually.  Additionally, many of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities, such as our California wineries and our Lodi Distribution Center in Lodi, CA, are located in areas which are prone to seismic activity.  If any of these vineyards and facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace the vineyard or facility.  If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.  In addition, since we have consolidated certain of our operations and various production and distribution facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption of our operations in the event of a catastrophic event in any one 13Table of Contentslocation, such as through acts of war or terrorism, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other natural or man-made disasters.  Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, certain catastrophes are not covered by our insurance policies as we believe this to be a prudent financial decision.  Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain insurance.  If our insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at greater risk that we may experience an adverse impact to our financial results.  We take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by a catastrophic event, but there is no certainty that our efforts would prove successful.  If one or more significant uninsured events occur, we could suffer a major financial loss.Expansion issues and operational disruptionsWe are currently expanding our Brewery and our joint venture with Owens-Illinois is expanding the glass plant.  While these multi-million dollar expansion activities are progressing with no unanticipated issues, there is always the potential risk of completion delays and cost overruns.  Our supply of Mexican Beer Brands would be negatively impacted if a serious delay in these expansion activities were to occur, leading to a negative impact upon our results of operation and financial condition.Many of our production facilities, such as our Brewery, wineries and distillery, and the Mexican glass plant held by the joint venture with Owens-Illinois are asset intensive.  Our profitability could be affected by operational disruption of any of our production or bottling lines or the glass furnace.  In such event we may experience an adverse effect to our business operations and profitability due to higher maintenance charges, unexpected capital spending or product supply constraints.Acquisition, divestiture and joint venture strategyWe have made a number of acquisitions and divestitures and may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business.  We may also divest ourselves of businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe no longer provide a strategic fit with our business.  We will need to integrate acquired businesses with our existing operations; our overall internal control over financial reporting processes; and our financial, operations and information systems.  If the financial performance of our business, as supplemented by the assets and businesses acquired, does not meet our expectations, it may make it more difficult for us to service our debt obligations and our results of operations may fail to meet market expectations.We cannot assure you that we will realize the expected benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures, such as revenue, earnings or operating efficiency, and we may not effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframes.  Complications with on-going integration of any acquisition or joint venture, including our Beer Business Acquisition or the acquisition of a Mexican glass plant by our joint venture with Owens-Illinois, could result from the following circumstances, among others:•failure to implement our business plan for the combined business;•unanticipated issues in integrating, migrating or changing manufacturing, logistics, information, communications, financial, internal control and other systems;•failure to retain key customers and suppliers;•unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;•failure to retain key employees;•operating risks inherent in the acquired businesses and assets and our business;•unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities;•failure to realize fully anticipated costs savings, growth opportunities and other potential synergies; and•unfamiliarity with operating new locations.14Table of ContentsThe integration of the Beer Business Acquisition can be further impacted by the following circumstances:•failure to expand the Brewery under the timeline imposed by the DOJ pursuant to the final judgment;•Brewery operations will be dependent upon the operational experience of employees who are relatively new to our organization; and•our ability to secure or expand Brewery capacity beyond the initial Brewery expansion and the incremental Brewery expansion in order to support future growth of our beer business.Our joint venture with Owens-Illinois to operate a glass plant adjacent to our Brewery is fully consolidated into our financial results and the entire output of that facility will be utilized to support our beer business and the production at our Brewery.  The integration of the Mexican glass plant acquisition can be further impacted by the following circumstances:•we share control of the joint venture with Owen-Illinois and while Owens-Illinois has deep experience running glass plants, we are not experienced in that particular business;•glass plant operations will be dependent upon the operational experience of employees who are relatively new to our organization; and•the ability of the joint venture to expand the glass plant capacity as planned in order to support the future growth of our beer business.If these events were to occur with respect to any of our acquisitions, including our Beer Business Acquisition or the Mexican glass plant joint venture’s acquisition of the glass plant, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.We may provide various indemnifications in connection with the sale of assets or portions of our business.  Additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates.  We cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses will remain constant.We have entered into joint ventures such as our Mexican glass plant joint venture with Owens-Illinois and we may enter into additional joint ventures for other purposes and with other parties.  We share control of our joint ventures.  We have also acquired or retained ownership interests in companies which we do not control.  Our joint venture partners or the other parties that hold the remaining ownership interests in companies which we do not control may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint ventures or those companies.  Our joint venture arrangements and the arrangements through which we acquired or hold our other equity or membership interests may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs, to make capital investments, to fulfill alone our joint venture partners’ obligations, or to purchase other parties’ interests.  Even though we share control of our Mexican glass plant joint venture, the financial results of that joint venture are consolidated into our financial results.  Our failure to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisition, or the failure of an entity in which we have an equity or membership interest, could adversely affect our financial condition or our valuation of these types of investments.We cannot assure you that any of our acquisitions, investments or joint ventures will be profitable or that forecasts regarding acquisition, divestiture, joint venture or investment activities will be accurate.IndebtednessIn recent years, we have incurred substantial indebtedness to finance our acquisitions, repurchase shares of our common stock and fund the Beer Business Acquisition.  In the future, we may continue to incur substantial additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions, repurchase shares of our stock and fund other general corporate purposes, including our Brewery expansions and expansion of the glass plant held through the Mexican glass plant joint venture.  We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet all of our debt service requirements, to pay dividends and to fund our general corporate and capital requirements.15Table of ContentsOur ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance.  We do not have complete control over our future operating performance because it is subject to prevailing economic conditions, levels of interest rates and financial, business and other factors.Our current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have important consequences.  These consequences include, or may include, the following:•our ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or acquisitions or other purposes may be limited;•our funds available for operations, expansions, dividends or other distributions may be reduced because we dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;•our ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants; and•our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than less leveraged competitors and, thus, our ability to withstand competitive pressures may be limited.Restrictive covenants in our senior credit facility and in our indentures place limits on our ability to conduct our business.  Covenants in our senior credit facility include those that restrict our ability to make acquisitions, incur debt, encumber or sell assets, pay dividends, engage in mergers and consolidations, enter into transactions with affiliates, make investments and permit our subsidiaries to enter into certain restrictive agreements.  It additionally contains certain financial covenants, including a debt ratio test and an interest coverage ratio test.  Covenants in our indentures are generally less restrictive than those in our senior credit facility but nevertheless, among other things, limit our ability under certain circumstances to create, encumber or enter into sale-leaseback transactions and impose conditions on our ability to engage in mergers, consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.These agreements also contain certain change of control provisions which, if triggered, may result in an acceleration of our obligation to repay the debt.  If we fail to comply with the obligations contained in the senior credit facility, our existing or future indentures or other loan agreements, we could be in default under such agreements, which could require us to immediately repay the related debt and also debt under other agreements that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.Potential decline in the consumption of products we sellWe rely on consumers’ demand for our products.  Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including changes in demographic or social trends, public health policies, and changes in leisure, dining and beverage consumption patterns.  Our continued success will require us to anticipate and respond effectively to shifts in consumer behavior and drinking tastes.  If consumer preferences were to move away from our premium brands, including our Mexican Beer Brands, in any of our major markets, our financial results might be adversely affected.While over the past several years there have been modest increases in consumption of beverage alcohol in most of our product categories and geographic markets, there have been periods in the past in which there were sequential declines in the overall per capita consumption of certain beverage alcohol product categories in the U.S. and other markets in which we participate.  A limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including:•a general decline in economic or geopolitical conditions;•concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and driving;•a general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in on-premise establishments, such as may result from smoking bans and stricter laws relating to driving while under the influence of alcohol;•consumer dietary preferences favoring lighter, lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks, sports drinks and water products;•the increased activity of anti-alcohol groups;16Table of Contents•increased federal, state, provincial and foreign excise or other taxes on beverage alcohol products and possible restrictions on beverage alcohol advertising and marketing;•increased regulation placing restrictions on the purchase or consumption of beverage alcohol products or increasing prices due to the imposition of duties or excise tax;•inflation; and•wars, pandemics, weather and natural or man-made disasters.In addition, our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products.  The launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain especially with regard to their appeal to consumers.  The launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and an unsuccessful launch, among other things, can affect consumer perception of existing brands and our reputation.  Unsuccessful implementation or short-lived popularity of our product innovations may result in inventory write-offs and other costs.Reliance on wholesale distributors, major retailers and government agenciesLocal market structures and distribution channels vary worldwide.  Within our primary market in the U.S., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the imported beer, branded wine and spirits categories, with separate distribution networks utilized for our imported beer portfolio and our wine and spirits portfolio.  In the U.S., we sell our products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets including grocery stores, club and discount stores, package liquor stores and restaurants and also directly to government agencies, while in Canada, we sell our products principally to government agencies.  In the U.S., we have entered into exclusive arrangements with certain wholesalers that generate a large portion of our U.S. wine and spirits sales.  The replacement or poor performance of our major wholesalers, retailers or government agencies could result in temporary or longer-term sales disruptions or could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition for a particular period.  Our inability to collect accounts receivable from our major wholesalers, retailers or government agencies could also materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the wholesale and retail distribution channels, particularly in the U.S.  If we are unable to adapt successfully to this changing environment, our net income, market share and volume growth could be negatively affected.  In addition, wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which compete directly with our products for retail shelf space, promotional support and consumer purchases.  Accordingly, wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products of our competitors.Reliance upon complex information systems and third party global networksWe depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers and suppliers, as well as maintain financial accuracy and efficiency.  If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach.  We recognize that many groups on a world-wide basis have experienced increases in cyber attacks and other hacking activity.  We have dedicated internal and external resources to review and address such threats.  However, as with all large information technology systems, our systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting confidential or proprietary information, corrupting our information, disrupting our business processes, or engaging in the unauthorized use of strategic information about us or our employees, customers or consumers.  Such unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in the loss of assets or revenues, litigation, remediation costs, damage to our reputation, or the failure by us to retain or attract customers following such an event.  Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.We have outsourced various functions to third-party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future.  We rely on those third-party service providers to provide services on a timely and effective basis.  Although we believe we have robust service level agreements with such third parties, closely monitor their performance and maintain contingency plans in case they are unable to perform as agreed, we do not ultimately control their performance.  Their failure to perform as expected or as required by contract could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating 17Table of Contentsresults and cash flow, and could impair our ability to make required filings with various reporting agencies on a timely or accurate basis.In connection with the Beer Business Acquisition, we currently have the right to receive various services pursuant to our transition services agreement with ABI.  These currently include certain limited services which are available for the time periods as set forth in the transition services agreement, which include certain general administrative services currently provided at our Brewery, including provision of certain historical data, and certain raw material supplies such as glass, malt, hops and yeast.Similarly, in connection with the Mexican glass plant acquisition, the glass plant joint venture currently receives various services pursuant to a transition services agreement with ABI.  These currently include certain general administrative services currently provided at the Mexican glass plant which are available for the time periods as set forth in the transition services agreement, including information technology (IT Service), finance and regulatory compliance, and certain services related to human resources.The failure of ABI (or any third party that ABI is permitted to outsource to) to perform as expected or as required by our contract or the glass plant joint venture’s contract could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations, and could also materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow, and could impair our ability to make required filings with various reporting agencies on a timely or accurate basis.Various diseases, pests and certain weather conditionsVarious diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, drought, frosts and certain other weather conditions could affect the quality and quantity of grapes, hops and other agricultural raw materials available, decreasing the supply of our products and negatively impacting profitability.  We cannot guarantee that our grape suppliers or our suppliers of other agricultural raw materials will succeed in preventing contamination in existing vineyards or fields or that we will succeed in preventing contamination in our existing vineyards or future vineyards we may acquire.  Future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in growing grapes or other agricultural raw materials may increase vineyard costs and/or reduce production of grapes or other crops.  Growing agricultural raw materials also requires adequate water supplies.  A substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines or other crops, which could lead to a shortage of our product supply.Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate changeOur business depends upon agricultural activity and natural resources.  There has been much public discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters.  Severe weather events, such as the current drought in California and recent prolonged cold winter in New York, and climate change may negatively affect agricultural productivity in the regions from which we presently source our various agricultural raw materials.  Decreased availability of our raw materials may increase the cost of goods for our products.  Severe weather events or changes in the frequency or intensity of weather events can also disrupt our supply chain, which may affect production operations, insurance cost and coverage, as well as delivery of our products to wholesalers, retailers and consumers.Control by the Sands FamilyOur Class B Common Stock is principally held by members of the Sands family, either directly or through entities controlled by members of the Sands family.  Holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to 10 votes per share.  Holders of Class 1 Common Stock generally do not have voting rights.  The stock ownership of the Sands family and entities controlled by members of the Sands family represents a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our common stock as of April 22, 2015, voting as a single class.  As a result, the Sands family has the power to elect a majority of our directors and approve actions requiring the approval of the stockholders of the Company voting as a single class.18Table of ContentsImport and excise duties or other taxes or government regulationThe U.S., Canada and other countries in which we operate impose import and excise duties and other taxes on beverage alcohol products in varying amounts which are subject to change.  Significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on beverage alcohol products could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.  The U.S. federal budget and individual state, provincial or local municipal budget deficits could result in increased taxes on our products, business, customers or consumers.  Various proposals to increase taxes on beverage alcohol products have been made at the federal and state or provincial level in recent years.  Many U.S. states have considered proposals to increase, and some of these states have increased, state alcohol excise taxes.  There may be further consideration by federal, state, provincial, local and foreign governmental entities to increase taxes upon beverage alcohol products as governmental entities explore available alternatives for raising funds during the current macroeconomic climate.  In addition, federal, state, provincial, local and foreign governmental agencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol products industry concerning such matters as licensing, warehousing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and required labeling, advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers.  Certain federal, state or provincial regulations also require warning labels and signage.  New or revised regulations or increased licensing fees, requirements or taxes could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Damage to our reputationMaintaining a good reputation is critical to selling our branded products.  Product contamination or tampering or the failure to maintain our standards for product quality, safety and integrity, including with respect to raw materials, naturally occurring compounds, packaging materials or product components obtained from suppliers, may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.  Although we maintain standards for the materials and product components we receive from our suppliers, and we also audit our suppliers’ compliance with our standards, it is possible that a supplier may not provide materials or product components which meet our required standards or may falsify documentation associated with the fulfillment of those requirements.  If any of our products becomes unsafe or unfit for consumption, is misbranded or causes injury, we may have to engage in a product recall and/or be subject to liability and incur additional costs.  A widespread product recall, multiple product recalls, or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period of time, which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity.  Our reputation could be impacted negatively by public perception, adverse publicity (whether or not valid), negative comments in social media, or our responses relating to:•a perceived failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities;•a perceived failure to address concerns relating to the quality, safety or integrity of our products;•our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, packaging, water and energy use, and waste management; or•effects that are perceived as insufficient to promote the responsible use of alcohol.Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls, to provide accurate and timely financial statement information, or to protect our information systems against service interruptions, misappropriation of data or breaches of security, could also hurt our reputation.  Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation, competitive position and brand equity.ContaminationThe success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of those brands.  Contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our brands, could adversely affect their sales.  Contaminants in raw materials, packaging materials or product components purchased from third parties and used in the production of our beer, wine or spirits products or defects in the fermentation or distillation process could lead to low beverage quality as 19Table of Contentswell as illness among, or injury to, consumers of our products and may result in reduced sales of the affected brand or all of our brands.Dependence upon trademarks and proprietary rights, failure to protect our intellectual property rightsOur future success depends significantly on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights.  We have been granted numerous trademark registrations covering our brands and products and have filed, and expect to continue to file, trademark applications seeking to protect newly-developed brands and products.  We cannot be sure that trademark registrations will be issued with respect to any of our trademark applications.  There is also a risk that we could, by omission, fail to timely renew or protect a trademark or that our competitors will challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us.Cost of energy or environmental regulatory complianceWe have experienced increases in energy costs in the past, and energy costs could rise in the future, which would result in higher transportation, freight and other operating costs.  We may experience significant future increases in the costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance, including fees, licenses, and the cost of capital improvements to our operating facilities in order to meet environmental regulatory requirements.  Our future operating expenses and margins will be dependent on our ability to manage the impact of cost increases.  We cannot guarantee that we will be able to pass along increased energy costs or increased costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance to our customers through increased prices.In addition, we may be party to various environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of our business or in connection with historical activities of businesses we acquire.  Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants in our current and former properties, the potential exists for remediation, liability and indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs that we have estimated.  We cannot assure you that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our projections or otherwise have an adverse effect upon our business reputation, financial condition or results of operations.Intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarksWe continue to have a significant amount of intangible assets such as goodwill and trademarks and may acquire more intangible assets in the future.  Intangible assets are subject to a periodic impairment evaluation under applicable accounting standards.  The write-down of any of these intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our net income.Benefit cost increases and labor relationsOur profitability is affected by employee medical costs and other employee benefits.  In recent years, employee medical costs have increased due to factors such as the increase in health care costs in the U.S.  These factors, plus the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in March 2010, are expected to continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance due to higher employee benefit costs.  Although we actively seek to control increases in employee benefit costs and encourage employees to maintain healthy lifestyles to reduce future potential medical costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases.  Continued employee benefit cost increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We believe our subsidiaries have good working relations with their employees.  However, if their employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, they could experience an operational disruption and/or experience higher on-going labor costs which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.20Table of ContentsClass action or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse, the misuse of alcohol, product liability, or marketing or sales practicesThere has been public attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry, which we believe is due to concern over problems related to harmful use of alcohol, including drinking and driving, underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol.  We also could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability or marketing or sales practices.  Adverse developments in lawsuits concerning these types of matters or a significant decline in the social acceptability of beverage alcohol products that may result from lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business"
9,STZ,CONSTELLATION BRANDS,2014-04-29,"Risk Factors
.In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  The risks described below are not the only risks we face.  Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.Worldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditionsWe are subject to risks associated with adverse economic conditions, including economic slowdown, inflation, and the disruption, volatility and tightening of credit and capital markets.  Unfavorable global or regional economic conditions could adversely impact our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.  Unemployment, tax increases, governmental spending cuts or a return of high levels of inflation could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our products.  These could also create or exacerbate credit issues, cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and our suppliers, distributors, retailers and consumers.  The inability of suppliers, distributors and retailers to access liquidity could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products.  We have a committed credit facility and additional liquidity facilities available to us.  While to date we have not experienced problems with accessing these facilities, to the extent that the financial institutions that participate in these facilities were to default on their obligation to fund, those funds would not be available to us.Global operations, currency rate fluctuations, interest rate fluctuations, and geopolitical uncertaintyOur products are produced and sold in numerous countries throughout the world, and we have announced plans to enter into certain emerging markets over time.  As a result of the Beer Business Acquisition, we also have operations in Mexico.Risks associated with international operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, include:•changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions;•potential disruption from socio-economic violence, including terrorism and drug-related violence;•restrictions on foreign ownership and investments or on repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;•changes in laws, governmental regulations and policies in many countries outside the U.S.;•import and export requirements;•currency exchange rate fluctuations;•a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment, which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues; •laws regarding the enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights;•inadequate levels of compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and•other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences.Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to overcome the challenges we encounter with respect to these factors and other matters generally affecting U.S. companies with global operations.  Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, business partners or agents will not violate our policies or take action determined to be in violation of the law.  Any determination that our operations or activities were not in compliance with applicable U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, interruptions of business, terminations of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal and equitable sanctions.We are also exposed to risks associated with currency fluctuations and risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.  Currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies in the markets in which we do business have fluctuated in recent years and are likely to continue to do so in the future.  We manage our exposure 10Table of Contentsto foreign currency and interest rate risks utilizing derivative instruments and other means to reduce those risks.  We could experience changes in our ability to hedge against or manage fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reducing those risks.  We could also be affected by nationalization of our international operations, unstable governments, unfamiliar or biased legal systems or intergovernmental disputes.  These currency, economic and political uncertainties may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, especially to the extent these matters, or the decisions, policies or economic strength of our suppliers and distributors, affect our global operations.CompetitionWe are in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and unit volume of our sales could be negatively affected by numerous factors including:•our inability to maintain or increase prices; •new entrants in our markets or categories; •a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption; or •the decision of wholesalers, retailers or consumers to purchase a competitor’s products instead of ours.Unit volume and dollar amount of sales could also be affected by pricing, purchasing, financing, operational, advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers, state and provincial agencies, and retailers which could affect their supply of, or consumer demand for, our products.  We could also experience higher than expected selling, general and administrative expenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising or marketing expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasons.Acquisition, divestiture and joint venture strategyWe have made a number of acquisitions and divestitures and may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business.  We may also divest ourselves of businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe no longer provide a strategic fit with our business.  We will need to integrate acquired businesses with our existing operations; our overall internal control over financial reporting processes; and our financial, operations and information systems.  If the financial performance of our business, as supplemented by the assets and businesses acquired, does not meet our expectations, it may make it more difficult for us to service our debt obligations and our results of operations may fail to meet market expectations.We cannot assure you that we will realize the expected benefits of acquisitions, such as revenue, earnings or operating efficiency, and we may not effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframes.  Complications with on-going integration of any acquisition, including our Beer Business Acquisition, could result from the following circumstances, among others:•failure to implement our business plan for the combined business;•unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information, communications, financial, internal control and other systems;•failure to retain key customers and suppliers;•unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;•failure to retain key employees;•operating risks inherent in the acquired businesses and assets and our business;•unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities;•failure to realize fully anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities and other potential synergies; and•unfamiliarity with operating in new locations.11Table of ContentsThe integration of the Beer Business Acquisition can be further impacted by the following circumstances:•failure to expand the Brewery under the timeline imposed by the DOJ pursuant to the final judgment;•Brewery operations will be dependent upon the operational experience of employees who are relatively new to our organization; and•our ability to secure or expand Brewery capacity beyond the initial Brewery expansion in order to support the future growth of our beer business.If these events were to occur with respect to any of our acquisitions, including our Beer Business Acquisition, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.We may provide various indemnifications in connection with the sale of assets or portions of our business.  Additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates.  We cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses will remain constant.We have entered into joint ventures and we may enter into additional joint ventures.  We share control of our joint ventures.  We have also acquired or retained ownership interests in companies which we do not control. Our joint venture partners or the other parties that hold the remaining ownership interests in companies which we do not control may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint ventures or those companies.  Our joint venture arrangements and the arrangements through which we acquired or hold our other equity or membership interests may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs, to make capital investments, to fulfill alone our joint venture partners’ obligations, or to purchase other parties’ interests.  Our failure to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisition, or the failure of an entity in which we have an equity or membership interest, could adversely affect our financial condition or our valuation of these types of investments.We cannot assure you that any of our acquisitions, investments or joint ventures will be profitable or that forecasts regarding acquisition, divestiture, joint venture or investment activities will be accurate.IndebtednessIn recent years, we have incurred substantial indebtedness to finance our acquisitions, repurchase shares of our common stock and fund the Beer Business Acquisition.  In the future, we may continue to incur substantial additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions, repurchase shares of our stock and fund other general corporate purposes, including our Brewery expansion.  We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet all of our debt service requirements and to fund our general corporate capital requirements.Our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance.  We do not have complete control over our future operating performance because it is subject to prevailing economic conditions, levels of interest rates and financial, business and other factors.Our current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have important consequences.  These consequences include, or may include, the following:•our ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or acquisitions or other purposes may be limited;•our funds available for operations, expansion or distributions may be reduced because we dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;•our ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants; and•our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than less leveraged competitors and, thus, our ability to withstand competitive pressures may be limited.12Table of ContentsRestrictive covenants in our senior credit facility and in our indentures place limits on our ability to conduct our business.  Covenants in our senior credit facility include those that restrict our ability to make acquisitions, incur debt, encumber or sell assets, pay dividends, engage in mergers and consolidations, enter into transactions with affiliates, make investments and permit our subsidiaries to enter into certain restrictive agreements.  It additionally contains certain financial covenants, including a debt ratio test and an interest coverage ratio test.  Covenants in our indentures are generally less restrictive than those in our senior credit facility but nevertheless, among other things, limit our ability under certain circumstances to create, encumber or enter into sale-leaseback transactions and impose conditions on our ability to engage in mergers, consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.These agreements also contain certain change of control provisions which, if triggered, may result in an acceleration of our obligation to repay the debt.  If we fail to comply with the obligations contained in the senior credit facility, our existing or future indentures or other loan agreements, we could be in default under such agreements, which could require us to immediately repay the related debt and also debt under other agreements that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.Control by the Sands FamilyOur Class B Common Stock is principally held by members of the Sands family, either directly or through entities controlled by members of the Sands family.  Holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to 10 votes per share.  Holders of Class 1 Common Stock generally do not have voting rights.  The stock ownership of the Sands family and entities controlled by members of the Sands family represents a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our common stock as of April 22, 2014, voting as a single class.  As a result, the Sands family has the power to elect a majority of our directors and approve actions requiring the approval of the stockholders of the Company voting as a single class.Potential decline in the consumption of products we sellWe rely on consumers’ demand for our products.  Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including changes in demographic or social trends, public health policies, and changes in leisure, dining and beverage consumption patterns.  Our continued success will require us to anticipate and respond effectively to shifts in consumer behavior and drinking tastes.  If consumer preferences were to move away from our premium brands in any of our major markets, our financial results might be adversely affected.  While over the past several years there have been modest increases in consumption of beverage alcohol in most of our product categories and geographic markets, there have been periods in the past in which there were substantial declines in the overall per capita consumption of beverage alcohol products in the U.S. and other markets in which we participate.  A limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including:•a general decline in economic or geopolitical conditions;•concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and driving;•a general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in on-premise establishments, such as may result from smoking bans and stricter laws related to driving while under the influence of alcohol;•consumer dietary preferences favoring lighter, lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks, sports drinks and water products;•the increased activity of anti-alcohol groups;•increased federal, state, provincial or foreign excise or other taxes on beverage alcohol products and possible restrictions on beverage alcohol advertising and marketing;•increased regulation placing restrictions on the purchase or consumption of beverage alcohol products or increasing prices due to the imposition of duties or excise tax;•inflation;•wars, pandemics, weather, and natural or man-made disasters; and•cost of gasoline and other petroleum-based products.13Table of ContentsIn addition, our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products.  The launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain especially with regard to their appeal to consumers.  The launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and an unsuccessful launch, among other things, can affect consumer perception of existing brands and our reputation.  Unsuccessful implementation or short-lived popularity of our product innovations may result in inventory write-offs and other costs.Reliance on wholesale distributors, major retailers and government agenciesLocal market structures and distribution channels vary worldwide.  Within our primary market in the U.S., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the imported beer, branded wine and spirits categories, with separate distribution networks utilized for our imported beer portfolio and our wine and spirits portfolio.  In the U.S., we sell our products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets including grocery stores, club and discount stores, package liquor stores and restaurants and also directly to government agencies, while in Canada, we sell our products principally to government agencies.  In the U.S., we have entered into exclusive arrangements with certain wholesalers that generate a large portion of our U.S. wine and spirits sales.  The replacement or poor performance of our major wholesalers, retailers or government agencies could result in temporary or longer-term sales disruptions or could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition for a particular period.  Our inability to collect accounts receivable from our major wholesalers, retailers or government agencies could also materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the wholesale and retail distribution channels, particularly in the U.S.  If we are unable to adapt successfully to this changing environment, our net income, market share and volume growth could be negatively affected.  In addition, wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which compete directly with our products for retail shelf space, promotional support and consumer purchases.  Accordingly, wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products of our competitors.Dependence on sales of our Mexican Beer BrandsSince the Beer Business Acquisition, sales of the Mexican Beer Brands in the U.S. have become a more significant portion of our business.  Accordingly, if the growth rate, amount or profitability of our sales of the Mexican Beer Brands in the U.S. declines, our business could be more adversely affected than as compared to a time prior to the Beer Business Acquisition.  Further, consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from the Mexican Beer Brands, the categories in which they compete, or beer generally due to, among other reasons, changing taste preferences, demographics or perceived value.  Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences and taste away from the Mexican Beer Brands, or from the categories in which they compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition and results of operations.Reliance upon complex information systems and third party global networksWe depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers and suppliers, as well as maintain financial accuracy and efficiency.  If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach.  We recognize that many groups on a world-wide basis have experienced increases in cyber attacks and other hacking activity.  We have dedicated internal and external resources to review and address such threats.  However, as with all large information technology systems, our systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting confidential or proprietary information, corrupting our information, disrupting our business processes, or engaging in the unauthorized use of strategic information about us or our employees, customers or consumers.  Such unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in the loss of assets or revenues, litigation, remediation costs, damage to our reputation, or the failure by us to retain or attract customers following such an event.  Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.14Table of ContentsWe have outsourced various functions to third-party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future.  We rely on those third-party service providers to provide services on a timely and effective basis.  Although we believe we have robust service level agreements with such third parties, closely monitor their performance and maintain contingency plans in case they are unable to perform as agreed, we do not ultimately control their performance.  Their failure to perform as expected or as required by contract could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow, and could impair our ability to make required filings with various reporting agencies on a timely or accurate basis.In connection with the Beer Business Acquisition, we currently receive various services pursuant to our transition services agreement with ABI.  These currently include the following services which are available for the time periods as set forth in the transition services agreement:•consulting services in logistical matters, materials resource planning and advisory services on procurement matters in connection with the transitioning of the operations of our Brewery;•general administrative services currently provided at our Brewery, including information technology (IT Service), finance and regulatory compliance, certain services related to the testing of products and packaging, human resources and certain promotional, retail and licensing services;•services relating to expansion of our Brewery; and•supply of aluminum cans, glass, malt, crowns and caps, hops, corn starch, can lids, cartons and yeast.The failure of ABI (or any third party that ABI is permitted to outsource to) to perform as expected or as required by our contract could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations, and could also materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow, and could impair our ability to make required filings with various reporting agencies on a timely or accurate basis.Supply of Mexican Beer BrandsIn order to fulfill our current and projected Mexican Beer Brands product requirements, we are currently dependent on our Brewery which is a single facility located in Nava, Coahuila, Mexico, and an interim supply agreement for our supply of Mexican Beer Brands through calendar year 2016.  Although we are assessing options for additional capacity requirements and sources of supply after the initial Brewery expansion is completed, our Brewery may become our sole source of supply for our Mexican Beer Brands.  The Brewery currently has the capacity to fill approximately 55% of our current projected product requirements.  We intend to expand the Brewery's capacity over a three-year period ending in calendar year 2016 and thus we have entered into an interim supply agreement for a supply of additional Mexican Beer Brands products for an initial period of three years.  This agreement also provides for up to two one-year extensions.  However, the United States, acting though the DOJ, will have a right of approval, in its sole discretion, of any extension of the term of this interim supply agreement beyond three years.  There can be no assurance that any requested extension would be granted.We may not be able to satisfy all of our product supply requirements for the Mexican Beer Brands in the event of a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the Brewery or our interim supplier’s breweries.  Also, if the contemplated expansion of our Brewery is not completed within three years after consummation of the Beer Business Acquisition, the Brewery may not be able to produce sufficient Mexican Beer Brands to satisfy our needs.  Under such circumstances, we may be unable to obtain Mexican Beer Brands at a reasonable price from another source, if at all.  A significant disruption at the Brewery or at our supplier’s breweries, even on a short-term basis, could impair our ability to produce and ship products to the market on a timely basis.  Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, any of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.  Additionally, our general insurance policies may not cover certain types of catastrophes that might affect our supply of the Mexican Beer Brands.  A major uninsured catastrophe could result in significant unrecoverable losses.15Table of ContentsSupply of quality water, agricultural and other raw materialsThe quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of our agricultural raw materials and our ability to operate our business.  Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe, there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints.  We are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of the Brewery, our wineries and our distillery, as well as to irrigate our vineyards.  The suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their vineyards and fields.  Our Brewery receives allotments of water originating from a mountain aquifer.  Although we anticipate receiving allotments adequate to support the Brewery’s on-going requirements, including as a result of the anticipated expansion, there is no guarantee that its allotments or requirements will not change materially in the future.  If water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarcer or the quality of that water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.  Even if quality water is widely available to the Brewery, our wineries, our distillery and our vineyards, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of our production facilities and vineyards.  Any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.The Brewery, our wineries and our distillery also use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce their products.  As to the Brewery, these include corn starch, malt, hops and water; the wineries use large amounts of grapes and water; and the distillery uses large amounts of grain and water.  The Brewery, our wineries and our distillery all use large amounts of various packaging materials, including glass, aluminum, cardboard and other paper products.  Our production facilities also use a significant amount of energy in their operations.  The supply and price of these raw materials and energy can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices), droughts and other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, inflation, plant diseases and theft.  To the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of ingredients or packaging or we do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.Catastrophic loss to wineries, production facilities or distribution systemsThroughout the years, we have consolidated several of our winery and production facility operations.  Three of our largest wineries are the Woodbridge Winery in Acampo, CA, the Mission Bell Winery in Madera, CA, and the Canandaigua Winery in Canandaigua, NY.  These three facilities produce approximately 34.5 million cases (or approximately 52.9%) of our global wine and spirits product annually.  Additionally, many of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities, such as our California wineries and our Lodi Distribution Center in Lodi, CA, are located in areas which are prone to seismic activity.  If any of these vineyards and facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace the vineyard or facility.  If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.  In addition, since we have consolidated certain of our operations and various production and distribution facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption of our operations in the event of a catastrophic event in any one location, such as through acts of war or terrorism, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other natural or man-made disasters.  Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, certain catastrophes are not covered by our insurance policies as we believe this to be a prudent financial decision.  Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain insurance.  If our insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at greater risk that we may experience an adverse impact to our financial results.  We take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by a catastrophic event, but there is no certainty that our efforts would prove successful.  If one or more significant uninsured events occur, we could suffer a major financial loss.16Table of ContentsRaw materials purchased under short-term supply contracts and limited group of suppliers of glass bottlesOur business is heavily dependent upon raw materials, such as grapes, grape juice concentrate, grains, alcohol and packaging materials from third-party suppliers.  We could experience raw material supply, production or shipment difficulties that could adversely affect our ability to supply goods to our customers.  Increases in the costs of raw materials also directly affect us.  The prices for raw materials and packaging materials from third-party suppliers fluctuate depending upon market conditions.  For example, in the past, we have experienced dramatic increases in the cost of grapes.  Although we believe we have adequate sources of grape supplies, we could experience shortages if the demand for particular wine products exceeds expectations.The wine industry swings between cycles of grape oversupply and undersupply.  In a severe oversupply environment, the ability of wine producers, including ourselves, to raise prices is limited, and, in certain situations, the competitive environment may put pressure on producers to lower prices.  Further, although an oversupply may enhance opportunities to purchase grapes at lower costs, a producer’s selling and promotional expenses associated with the sale of its wine products can rise in such an environment.  Substantial increases in the prices of raw materials and packaging materials, including those from third-party suppliers, to the extent they cannot be recouped through increases in the price of our finished products, would increase our operating costs and could decrease our profitability.  Our net sales could be impacted negatively if our customers cannot afford our products.Glass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold.  We currently purchase from ABI all of the glass bottles for our Mexican Beer Brands.  In the U.S. and Canada, glass bottles have only a small number of producers.  Currently, one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our U.S. operations and a portion of our glass container requirements for our Canadian operations, with the remaining portion of our glass container requirements for our Canadian operations supplied by another producer.  The inability of any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements could adversely affect our business.Various diseases, pests and certain weather conditionsVarious diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, drought, frosts and certain other weather conditions could affect the quality and quantity of grapes and other agricultural raw materials available, decreasing the supply of our products and negatively impacting profitability.  We cannot guarantee that our grape suppliers or our suppliers of other agricultural raw materials will succeed in preventing contamination in existing vineyards or fields or that we will succeed in preventing contamination in our existing vineyards or future vineyards we may acquire.  Future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in growing grapes or other agricultural raw materials may increase vineyard costs and/or reduce production of grapes or other crops.  Growing agricultural raw materials also requires adequate water supplies.  A substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines or other crops, which could lead to a shortage of our product supply.Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate changeOur business depends upon agricultural activity and natural resources.  There has been much public discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters.  Severe weather events, such as the recent drought in California and prolonged cold winter in New York, and climate change may negatively affect agricultural productivity in the regions from which we presently source our various agricultural raw materials.  Decreased availability of our raw materials may increase the cost of goods for our products.  Severe weather events or changes in the frequency or intensity of weather events can also disrupt our supply chain, which may affect production operations, insurance cost and coverage, as well as delivery of our products to wholesalers, retailers and consumers.Import and excise duties or other taxes or governmentThe U.S., Canada and other countries in which we operate impose import and excise duties and other taxes on beverage alcohol products in varying amounts which are subject to change.  Significant increases in import and 17Table of Contentsexcise duties or other taxes on beverage alcohol products could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.  The U.S. federal budget and individual state, provincial or local municipal budget deficits could result in increased taxes on our products, business, customers or consumers.  Various proposals to increase taxes on beverage alcohol products have been made at the federal and state or provincial level in recent years.  Many U.S. states have considered proposals to increase, and some of these states have increased, state alcohol excise taxes.  There may be further consideration by federal, state, provincial, local and foreign governmental entities to increase taxes upon beverage alcohol products as governmental entities explore available alternatives for raising funds during the current macroeconomic climate.  In addition, federal, state, provincial, local and foreign governmental agencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol products industry concerning such matters as licensing, warehousing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and required labeling, advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers.  Certain federal, state or provincial regulations also require warning labels and signage.  New or revised regulations or increased licensing fees, requirements or taxes could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Benefit cost increasesOur profitability is affected by employee medical costs and other employee benefits.  In recent years, employee medical costs have increased due to factors such as the increase in health care costs in the U.S.  These factors, plus the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in March 2010, are expected to continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance due to higher employee benefit costs.  Although we actively seek to control increases in employee benefit costs and encourage employees to maintain healthy lifestyles to reduce future potential medical costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases.  Continued employee benefit cost increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarksWe continue to have a significant amount of intangible assets such as goodwill and trademarks and may acquire more intangible assets in the future.  Intangible assets are subject to a periodic impairment evaluation under applicable accounting standards.  The write-down of any of these intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our net income.Class action or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse, the misuse of alcohol, product liability, or marketing or sales practices There has been public attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry, which we believe is due to concern over problems related to harmful use of alcohol, including drinking and driving, underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol.  We also could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability or marketing or sales practices.  Adverse developments in lawsuits concerning these types of matters or a significant decline in the social acceptability of beverage alcohol products that may result from lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business.Damage to our reputationMaintaining a good reputation is critical to selling our branded products.  Product contamination or tampering or the failure to maintain our standards for product quality, safety and integrity, including with respect to raw materials obtained from suppliers, may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.  Although we maintain standards for the materials and product components we receive from our suppliers, and we also audit our suppliers’ compliance with our standards, it is possible that a supplier may not provide materials or product components which meet our required standards or may falsify documentation associated with the fulfillment of those requirements.  If any of our products becomes unfit for consumption, is misbranded or causes injury, we may have to engage in a product recall and/or be subject to liability and incur additional costs.  A widespread product recall or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period of time, which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity.  Our reputation 18Table of Contentscould be impacted negatively by public perception, adverse publicity (whether or not valid), negative comments in social media, or our responses relating to:•a perceived failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities;•a perceived failure to address concerns related to the quality, safety or integrity of our products;•our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, packaging, water and energy use and waste management; or•efforts that are perceived as insufficient to promote the responsible use of alcohol.Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls, to provide accurate and timely financial statement information, or to protect our information systems against service interruptions, misappropriation of data or breaches of security, could also hurt our reputation.  Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation, competitive position and brand equity.Dependence upon trademarks and proprietary rights, failure to protect our intellectual property rightsOur future success depends significantly on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights.  We have been granted numerous trademark registrations covering our brands and products and have filed, and expect to continue to file, trademark applications seeking to protect newly-developed brands and products.  We cannot be sure that trademark registrations will be issued with respect to any of our trademark applications.  There is also a risk that we could, by omission, fail to timely renew or protect a trademark or that our competitors will challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us.ContaminationThe success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of those brands.  Contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our brands, could adversely affect their sales.  Contaminants in raw materials purchased from third parties and used in the production of our beer, wine or spirits products or defects in the fermentation or distillation process could lead to low beverage quality as well as illness among, or injury to, consumers of our products and may result in reduced sales of the affected brand or all of our brands.Cost of energy or environmental regulatory complianceWe have experienced increases in energy costs, and energy costs could continue to rise, which would result in higher transportation, freight and other operating costs.  We may experience significant future increases in the costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance, including fees, licenses, and the cost of capital improvements to our operating facilities in order to meet environmental regulatory requirements.  Our future operating expenses and margins will be dependent on our ability to manage the impact of cost increases.  We cannot guarantee that we will be able to pass along increased energy costs or increased costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance to our customers through increased prices.In addition, we may be party to various environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of our business or in connection with historical activities of businesses we acquire.  Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants in our current and former properties, the potential exists for remediation, liability and indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs that we have estimated.  We cannot assure you that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our projections or otherwise have an adverse effect upon our business reputation, financial condition or results of operations.19Table of Contents"

.In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  The risks described below are not the only risks we face.  Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.Worldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions could adversely impact our financial performance.Although we believe the adverse worldwide and domestic economic conditions experienced over recent years are improving, the degree and pace of recovery is uncertain and is expected to vary around the globe.  Worldwide and domestic economies remain subject to prolongation, exacerbation and expansion of adverse conditions.  In addition, instability in global credit markets, including the uncertainty related to sovereign debt issues in certain countries in the European Union, the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world, and other disruptions, may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions.  We are subject to risks associated with adverse economic conditions, including economic slowdown, inflation, and the disruption, volatility and tightening of credit and capital markets.  Additionally, changes in economic and financial conditions in the United States (“U.S.”) and other countries, including the outcome of negotiations surrounding the U.S. “sequester”, tax increases and potential spending cuts may impact consumer confidence and consumer spending.In addition, unfavorable global or domestic economic situations could adversely impact our major suppliers, distributors and retailers.  The inability of suppliers, distributors or retailers to conduct business or to access liquidity could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products.  We have a committed credit facility and additional liquidity facilities available to us.  While to date we have not experienced problems with accessing these facilities, to the extent that the financial institutions that participate in these facilities were to default on their obligation to fund, those funds would not be available to us.The timing and nature of any recovery in the financial markets continues to remain uncertain, and there can be no assurance that market conditions will continue to improve in the near future.  A prolonged downturn, worsening or broadening of adverse conditions in the worldwide and domestic economies, or return of high levels of inflation could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our products, and create or exacerbate credit issues, cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and for our suppliers, distributors, retailers and consumers.  Depending upon their severity and duration, these conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.  We are not able to predict the pace of recovery of the economies in the U.S. and our other major markets outside the U.S., nor are we able to predict the outcome of negotiations surrounding the U.S. “sequester”.Any failure to complete the pending Beer Business Acquisition could materially adversely impact the market price of our common stock.On June 28, 2012, we entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the “MIPA”) with Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (“ABI”) under which we agreed that, through our subsidiaries, we would acquire the remaining 50% of Crown Imports for a purchase price of approximately $1.85 billion.  In addition, on June 28, 2012, we entered into an interim loan agreement (the “Bridge”) to provide for fully committed bridge financing in order to complete the acquisition.  The Bridge provided for aggregate credit facilities of $1.875 billion.  On February 13, 2013, we amended and restated the MIPA, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”), and amended and restated the Bridge and on April 19, 2013, we further amended the MIPA and amended the SPA.  As a result of these activities, we have agreed to acquire (i) the remaining 50% of Crown Imports for a purchase price of approximately $1.85 billion, and (ii) the stock of a company that holds the Piedras Negras brewery located in Nava, Coahuila, Mexico (the “Brewery”) together with the stock of the company which provides workers for the Brewery (together, the “Brewery Companies”), and will be granted perpetual brand licenses for the Mexican portfolio of Crown Imports currently sold in the U.S. and certain extensions for approximately $2.9 billion, subject to certain 9Table of Contents                                        closing adjustments.  Collectively, these acquisition activities are the “Beer Business Acquisition”.  Pursuant to our current amended and restated Bridge financing, we have committed financing of up to $4.375 billion.If the Beer Business Acquisition is not completed for any reason the price of our common stock will likely decline to the extent that the market price of our common stock reflects market assumptions that the acquisition will be completed.  We cannot guarantee that the Beer Business Acquisition will be completed on the agreed upon terms or at all.  Consummation of that acquisition is subject to the following risks and uncertainties, among others:•ABI and Grupo Modelo, S.A.B. de C.V. (“Modelo”) (and affiliated entities of each of them) may not complete their transaction due to lack of receipt of necessary regulatory approval, legal challenges by private parties, or otherwise.•Although our Bridge provides committed financing for additional debt to fund most of the purchase price, there is no guarantee that the Bridge lenders will fulfill their obligations to us or that we will be able to otherwise finance the Beer Business Acquisition.Due to its unique nature, if the Beer Business Acquisition does not occur it is unlikely that a comparable transaction can be consummated.In order to complete the Beer Business Acquisition, we will incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing in the future.We currently expect to finance the Beer Business Acquisition with available cash and proceeds from a combination of debt financings, including the issuance of notes, additional term loans and revolver borrowings under our senior credit facility and borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility.  We anticipate that it will be necessary for us to amend our current senior credit facility in order to provide for certain of this additional debt needed to fund the Beer Business Acquisition.  The incurrence of the additional debt to fund the approximately $4.75 billion aggregate purchase price for the Beer Business Acquisition may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and may limit our ability to obtain financing in the future.  We may have to obtain financing under the Bridge Facility if we cannot secure some or all of the expected permanent financing.  The interest rates and other financial terms for debt incurred pursuant to the Bridge Facility would be generally less favorable than what we have contemplated under our present plans for permanent financing arrangements.  In addition, the Bridge Facility imposes various covenants and restrictions upon us which would apply in the event we obtained financing under it.If we fail to realize the expected benefits from the Beer Business Acquisition, it may make it more difficult for us to service our debt and our results of operations may fail to meet expectations.If the financial performance of our business, as supplemented by the assets and business acquired in the Beer Business Acquisition, does not meet our expectations, it may make it more difficult for us to service our debt obligations and our results of operations may fail to meet market expectations.  We may not realize the expected benefits of the Beer Business Acquisition because of integration difficulties and other challenges.  The success of the Beer Business Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate the acquired assets and business with our existing businesses. The integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming.  Complications with the integration could result from the following circumstances, among others:•failure to implement our business plan for the combined business;•unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information, communications and other systems;•failure to retain key customers and suppliers;•unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;•failure to retain key employees of Crown or the Brewery Companies;•operating risks inherent in the acquired businesses and assets and our business;•failure to expand the Brewery under the timeline imposed by the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice pursuant to its proposed final judgment;•unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities; and•unfamiliarity with operating in Mexico.10Table of Contents                                        We may not be able to achieve the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that we expect with respect to our operation of the Brewery and our full ownership of Crown and other acquired assets.  In addition, we may not accomplish the integration smoothly, including the expansion of the Brewery, successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframe.  If we experience difficulties with the integration process or if the anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities and other potential synergies of the Beer Business Acquisition are not realized fully, or at all, or take longer to realize than expected, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.Our experience operating breweries is not of the size and complexity contemplated by the Beer Business Acquisition.Although we have prior experience operating breweries, it is not of the size and complexity contemplated by the Beer Business Acquisition.  In order to operate the Brewery we will be dependent upon the operational experience of employees who are new to our organization.Our business will become more dependent on our sales of Modelo Brands’ products.Following completion of the Beer Business Acquisition, sales of the Modelo Brands in the U.S. will become a more significant portion of our business.  Accordingly, if the growth rate, amount or profitability of our sales of the Modelo Brands in the U.S. declines, our business could be more adversely affected than as compared to a time prior to the Beer Business Acquisition.  The Modelo Brands are among the top imported premium beer brands in the U.S; Corona Extra is the leading imported brand, Modelo Especial is third and Corona Light is first among imported light beers.  Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences away from the Modelo Brands, or from the categories in which they compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from the Modelo Brands or beer generally due to, among other reasons, changing taste preferences, demographics or perceived value.  Such changes in performance and taste could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We will become dependent on the Brewery for our supply of Modelo Brands and, eventually, the Brewery is expected to be our sole source of supply for the Modelo Brands.The majority of Crown's requirements for Modelo Brands are produced by the Brewery, which is a single facility located in Nava, Coahuila, Mexico, and our contractual arrangements with ABI anticipate that eventually all of Crown's supply of the Modelo Brands will be produced by the Brewery.  We intend to expand the Brewery's capacity over the three-year period following consummation of the Beer Business Acquisition and will enter into interim supply arrangements for a supply of additional Modelo Brands products for a period of three years following consummation of the Beer Business Acquisition.  These arrangements will also provide for up to two one-year extensions.  However, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice will have a right of approval, in its sole discretion, of any extension of the term of these interim supply arrangements beyond three years.  There can be no assurance that any requested extension would be granted.Crown may not be able to satisfy all its product supply requirements for Modelo Brands in the event of a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the Brewery due to terrorism or other risks such as natural disasters or catastrophic events that damage or destroy the facility.  Also, if the contemplated expansion of the Brewery is not completed within three years after consummation of the Beer Business Acquisition, the Brewery may not be able to produce sufficient Modelo Brands to satisfy our needs.  Under such circumstances, we may be unable to obtain Modelo Brands at a reasonable price from another source, if at all.  A significant disruption at the Brewery, even on a short-term basis, could impair our ability to produce and ship products to the market on a timely basis.  Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, any of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.  Additionally, our general insurance policies may not cover certain types of catastrophes that might affect the Brewery.  A major uninsured catastrophe could result in significant unrecoverable losses.  The Brewery currently has the capacity to fill approximately 60% of our current projected product requirements.11Table of Contents                                        We face risks associated with the SPA in connection with the Beer Business Acquisition.In connection with the Beer Business Acquisition, the companies we acquire may have liabilities that are not satisfied on or prior to the closing date.  There may be liabilities that we underestimated or did not discover in the course of performing our due diligence investigation of the Brewery Companies we will acquire.  Under the SPA, ABI has agreed to provide us with a limited set of representations and warranties.  Our sole remedy from ABI for any breach of those representations and warranties is an action for indemnification, not to exceed $500 million under the SPA.  Damages resulting from a breach of a representation or warranty could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our operation of the Brewery will depend on a sufficient supply of quality water and agricultural and other raw materials.We will be dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of the Brewery.  The Brewery receives allotments of water originating from a mountain aquifer.  Although we anticipate receiving allotments adequate to support the brewery’s on-going requirements, including as a result of the anticipated expansion, there is no guarantee that its allotments or requirements will not change materially in the future.  If water becomes scarcer or the quality of the water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.  Even if quality water is widely available to the brewery, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of the brewery. Any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.The Brewery also uses a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce its products, such as corn starch, malt, hops, and water, and packaging materials, including glass, aluminum, cardboard and other paper products.  The Brewery also uses a significant amount of energy in its operations.  The supply and price of these raw materials and energy can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices), droughts and other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, inflation, plant diseases and theft.  To the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of ingredients or packaging or do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.Expanding our operations into Mexico increases risks associated with international operations.We have limited operating experience in Mexico.  Completion of the Beer Business Acquisition will generally increase the potential risks and uncertainties associated with our doing business globally, including risks relating to currency rate fluctuations, interest rate fluctuations, and geopolitical uncertainty, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operation of Crown and the Brewery.  Our operations in Mexico will expose us to additional risks associated with international operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including:•changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions;•potential disruption from socio-economic violence, including drug-related violence;•restrictions on foreign ownership and investments or on repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;•import and export requirements;•currency exchange rate fluctuations;•a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment, which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues; •compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and•other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences.12Table of Contents                                        Other risks and uncertainties which we currently face will be increased by the Beer Business Acquisition.Upon completion of the Beer Business Acquisition, some of the other risks and uncertainties we already face and which are described more fully elsewhere in this section will be increased, such as risks and uncertainties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, relating to:•the possibility of increases in import and excise duties or other taxes or government regulations;•the possibility that benefit cost increases could occur and reduce our profitability;•the possibility that various diseases, pests and certain weather conditions could affect the quality and quantity of agricultural raw materials used in production of our products;•our purchase of raw materials under short-term supply contracts;•the amount of our intangible assets and the possibility of a write-down relating to any of these assets;•the possibility of a class action or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse, the misuse of alcohol, product liability, or marketing or sales practices;•any damage to our reputation;•our dependence on trademarks and proprietary rights, and any failure to protect our intellectual property rights or any claims that we are infringing upon the rights of others;•contamination harming the integrity of or consumer support for our brands;•increases in the cost of energy or the costs of environmental regulatory compliance; and•our reliance upon complex information systems distributed worldwide and our reliance upon third party global networks and the possibility we could experience breaches of security or interruptions to our business services.We are controlled by the Sands Family.Our Class B common stock is principally held by members of the Sands family, either directly or through entities controlled by members of the Sands family.  Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of Class B common stock are entitled to 10 votes per share.  Holders of Class 1 common stock generally do not have voting rights.  The stock ownership of the Sands family and entities controlled by members of the Sands family represents a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of the Company’s common stock as of April 22, 2013, voting as a single class.  As a result, the Sands family has the power to elect a majority of the Company’s directors and approve actions requiring the approval of the stockholders of the Company voting as a single class.Our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our financial health.We have incurred substantial indebtedness to finance our acquisitions and repurchase shares of our common stock, and we will incur substantial additional indebtedness to fund the Beer Business Acquisition.  In the future, we may continue to incur substantial additional indebtedness to finance further acquisitions, additional repurchases of shares of our stock, and other general corporate purposes.  Our ability to satisfy our debt obligations outstanding from time to time will depend upon our future operating performance.  We do not have complete control over our future operating performance because it is subject to prevailing economic conditions, levels of interest rates and financial, business and other factors.  We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet all of our debt service requirements and to fund our general corporate capital requirements.Our current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have important consequences to you.  These consequences include, or may include, the following:•Our ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or acquisitions or other purposes may be limited;•Our funds available for operations, expansion or distributions will be reduced because we will dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;•Our ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants; and•Our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than less leveraged competitors and, thus, our ability to withstand competitive pressures may be limited.13Table of Contents                                        Restrictive covenants in our senior credit facility and in our indentures place limits on our ability to conduct our business.  Covenants in our senior credit facility include those that restrict our ability to make acquisitions, incur debt, create liens, sell assets, pay dividends, engage in mergers and consolidations, enter into transactions with affiliates, make investments and permit our subsidiaries to enter into certain restrictive agreements.  It additionally contains certain financial covenants, including a debt ratio test and an interest coverage ratio test.  Covenants in our indentures are generally less restrictive than our senior credit facility but nevertheless, among other things, limit our ability under certain circumstances to create liens or enter into sale-leaseback transactions and impose conditions on our ability to engage in mergers, consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.These agreements also contain certain change of control provisions which, if triggered, may result in an acceleration of our obligation to repay the debt.  If we fail to comply with the obligations contained in the senior credit facility, our existing or future indentures or other loan agreements, we could be in default under such agreements, which could require us to immediately repay the related debt and also debt under other agreements that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.Our acquisition, divestiture and joint venture strategies may not be successful.We have made a number of acquisitions and divestitures.  We anticipate that we may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business and that we may divest ourselves of businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe no longer provide a strategic fit with our business.  We will need to integrate acquired businesses with our existing operations; our overall internal control over financial reporting processes; and our financial, operations and information systems.  We cannot assure you that we will effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or realize anticipated operational synergies.  Integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our existing operations or separating from our existing operations the operations and personnel of businesses of which we divest may result in difficulties, significant expense and accounting charges, disrupt our business or divert management’s time and attention.We expect to acquire the remaining 50% interest in Crown Imports and 100% of the interest in the Brewery Companies, and we recently acquired the remaining 50.1% interest in Ruffino S.r.l. and sold 80.1% of our Australian and U.K. business.  In connection with the integration of acquired operations, the separation of divested businesses, or the conduct of our overall business strategies, we may periodically restructure our businesses, integrate or separate our financial, operations and/or information systems, reorganize the management and reporting relationships within our business and/or sell assets or portions of our business.  We may not achieve expected cost savings or efficiencies from restructuring activities or realize the expected proceeds from sales of assets or portions of our business.  Actual charges, costs and adjustments due to restructuring activities may vary materially from our estimates.  We may provide various indemnifications in connection with the sale of assets or portions of our business.  Additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates.  We cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses will remain constant.Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business.  In connection with acquisitions or joint venture investments outside the U.S., we may enter into derivative contracts to purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against the risk of foreign currency fluctuations in connection with such acquisitions or joint venture investments.  This would subject us to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations associated with such derivative contracts.We have also acquired or retained equity or membership interests in companies which we do not control, such as our retained less than 20% interest in certain companies that comprised our Australian and U.K. business.  The other parties that hold the remaining equity or membership interests in these types of companies may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of those companies.  The arrangements through which we acquired or hold our equity or membership interests may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs or to purchase other parties’ interests.  Our failure to adequately 14Table of Contents                                        manage the risks associated with any acquisition, or the failure of an entity in which we have an equity or membership interest, could adversely affect our financial condition or our valuation of these types of investments.We have entered into joint ventures, including our joint venture with Modelo and our holdings in Opus One Winery LLC, and we may enter into additional joint ventures.  We share control of our joint ventures.  Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint venture.  Our joint venture arrangements may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments.  In addition, our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone.  Our failure or the failure of an entity in which we have a joint venture interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.We cannot assure you that any of our acquisitions, investments or joint ventures will be profitable or that forecasts regarding joint venture activities will be accurate.  In particular, risks and uncertainties associated with our joint ventures include, among others, the joint venture’s ability to operate its business successfully, the joint venture’s ability to develop appropriate standards, controls, procedures and policies for the growth and management of the joint venture, and the strength of the joint venture’s relationships with its employees, suppliers and customers.Competition could have a material adverse effect on our business.We are in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and unit volume of our sales could be negatively affected by our inability to maintain or increase prices, changes in geographic or product mix, a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption or the decision of wholesalers, retailers or consumers to purchase competitor’s products instead of our products.  Wholesaler, retailer and consumer purchasing decisions are influenced by, among other things, the perceived absolute or relative overall value of our products, including their quality or pricing, compared to competitor’s products.  Unit volume and dollar sales could also be affected by pricing, purchasing, financing, operational, advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers, state and provincial agencies, and retailers which could affect their supply of, or consumer demand for, our products.  We could also experience higher than expected selling, general and administrative expenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising or marketing expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasons.An increase in import and excise duties or other taxes or government regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.The U.S., Canada and other countries in which we operate impose import and excise duties and other taxes on beverage alcohol products in varying amounts which have been subject to change.  Significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on beverage alcohol products could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.  The U.S. federal budget and individual state, provincial or local municipal budget deficits could result in increased taxes on our products, business, customers or consumers.  Various proposals to increase taxes on beverage alcohol products have been made at the federal and state or provincial level in recent years.  Many U.S. states have considered proposals to increase, and some of these states have increased, state alcohol excise taxes.  There may be further consideration by federal, state, provincial, local and foreign governmental entities to increase taxes upon beverage alcohol products as governmental entities explore available alternatives for raising funds during the current macroeconomic climate.  In addition, federal, state, provincial, local and foreign governmental agencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol products industry concerning such matters as licensing, warehousing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and required labeling, advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers.  Certain federal, state or provincial regulations also require warning labels and signage.  New or revised regulations or increased licensing fees, requirements or taxes could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Benefit cost increases could reduce our profitability.Our profitability is affected by employee medical costs and other employee benefits.  In recent years, employee medical costs have increased due to factors such as the increase in health care costs in the U.S.  These 15Table of Contents                                        factors, plus the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in March 2010, will continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance due to higher employee benefit costs.  Although we actively seek to control increases in employee benefit costs and encourage employees to maintain healthy lifestyles to reduce future potential medical costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases.  Continued employee benefit cost increases could have an adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition.We also sponsor a very limited number of defined benefit plans that cover a limited number of our non-U.S. employees.  Our costs of providing defined benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as discount rates, the rates of return on the plans’ assets, exchange rate fluctuations, future governmental regulation, global equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans.  Without sustained growth in pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans’ assets, and depending upon the other factors relating to worldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions, we could be required to increase funding for some or all of our defined benefit plans.We rely on the performance of wholesale distributors, major retailers and government agencies for the success of our business.Local market structures and distribution channels vary worldwide.  In the U.S., we sell our products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets including grocery stores, club and discount stores, package liquor stores and restaurants and also directly to government agencies, while in Canada, we sell our products principally to government agencies.  In the U.S., we have entered into exclusive arrangements with certain wholesalers that generate a large portion of our U.S. net sales.  The replacement or poor performance of our major wholesalers, retailers or government agencies could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Our inability to collect accounts receivable from our major wholesalers, retailers or government agencies could also materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.The industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the wholesale and retail distribution channels, particularly in the U.S.  If we are unable to successfully adapt to this changing environment, our net income, market share and volume growth could be negatively affected.  In addition, wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which compete directly with our products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases.  Accordingly, wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products of our competitors.  In the future, our wholesalers and retailers may not continue to purchase our products or provide our products with adequate levels of promotional support.Our business could be adversely affected by a decline in the consumption of products we sell.While over the past several years there have been modest increases in consumption of beverage alcohol in most of our product categories and geographic markets, there have been periods in the past in which there were substantial declines in the overall per capita consumption of beverage alcohol products in the U.S. and other markets in which we participate.  A limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including:•A general decline in economic or geopolitical conditions;•Concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and driving;•A general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in on-premise establishments, such as may result from smoking bans and stricter laws related to driving while under the influence of alcohol;•Consumer dietary preferences favoring lighter, lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks, sports drinks and water products;•The increased activity of anti-alcohol groups;•Increased federal, state, provincial or foreign excise or other taxes on beverage alcohol products and possible restrictions on beverage alcohol advertising and marketing; and•Increased regulation placing restrictions on the purchase or consumption of beverage alcohol products.16Table of Contents                                        We are primarily a branded consumer products company and we rely on consumers’ demand for our products.  Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including changes in demographic or social trends, public health policies, and changes in leisure, dining and beverage consumption patterns.  Our continued success will require us to anticipate and respond effectively to shifts in consumer behavior and drinking tastes.  If consumer preferences were to move away from our premium brands in any of our major markets, our financial results might be adversely affected.  Other factors may also reduce consumer spending on our products, including economic declines, inflation, a trend towards frugality even as the economy improves, wars, pandemics, weather, and natural or man-made disasters.  As the cost of gasoline and other petroleum-based products increases, consumers may not have as much discretionary funds available to buy our products.In addition, our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products.  The launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain especially with regard to their appeal to consumers.  The launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and an unsuccessful launch, among other things, can affect consumer perception of existing brands and our reputation.  Unsuccessful implementation or short-lived popularity of our product innovations may result in inventory write-offs and other costs.Various diseases, pests and certain weather conditions could affect quality and quantity of grapes or other agricultural raw materials.Various diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, drought, frosts and certain other weather conditions could affect the quality and quantity of grapes and other agricultural raw materials available, decreasing the supply of our products and negatively impacting profitability.  We cannot guarantee that our grape suppliers or suppliers of other agricultural raw materials will succeed in preventing contamination in existing vineyards or fields or that we will succeed in preventing contamination in our existing vineyards or future vineyards we may acquire.  Future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in grape growing may increase vineyard costs and/or reduce production.  Growing agricultural raw materials also requires adequate water supplies.  A substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines or other crops, which could lead to a shortage of our product supply.We generally purchase raw materials under short-term supply contracts, we are subject to substantial price fluctuations for grapes and grape-related materials, and we have a limited group of suppliers of glass bottles.Our business is heavily dependent upon raw materials, such as grapes, grape juice concentrate, grains, alcohol and packaging materials from third-party suppliers.  We could experience raw material supply, production or shipment difficulties that could adversely affect our ability to supply goods to our customers.  Increases in the costs of raw materials also directly affect us.  In the past, we have experienced dramatic increases in the cost of grapes.  Although we believe we have adequate sources of grape supplies, we could experience shortages if the demand for particular wine products exceeds expectations.The wine industry swings between cycles of grape oversupply and undersupply.  In a severe oversupply environment, the ability of wine producers, including ourselves, to raise prices is limited, and, in certain situations, the competitive environment may put pressure on producers to lower prices.  Further, although an oversupply may enhance opportunities to purchase grapes at lower costs, a producer’s selling and promotional expenses associated with the sale of its wine products can rise in such an environment.Glass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold.  In the U.S. and Canada, glass bottles have only a small number of producers.  Currently, one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our U.S. operations and a portion of our glass container requirements for our Canadian operations, with the remaining portion of our glass container requirements for our Canadian operations supplied by another producer.  The inability of any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements could adversely affect our business.17Table of Contents                                        Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business, operations or financial performance, and water scarcity or poor quality could negatively impact our production costs and capacity.Our business depends upon agricultural activity and natural resources.  There has been much public discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters.  Severe weather events and climate change may negatively affect agricultural productivity in the regions from which we presently source our agricultural raw materials such as grapes.  Decreased availability of our raw materials may increase the cost of goods for our products.  Severe weather events or changes in the frequency or intensity of weather events can also disrupt our supply chain, which may affect production operations, insurance cost and coverage, as well as delivery of our products to wholesalers, retailers and consumers.Water is essential in the production of our products.  The quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of grapes and our ability to operate our business.  Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe, there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints.  Such events could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.If we suffer a loss to our wineries, production facilities or distribution system, or the breweries which produce the beer we sell, due to catastrophe, our business, operations or financial performance could be seriously harmed.Throughout the years, we have consolidated several of our winery and production facility operations.  Two of our largest wineries are the Woodbridge Winery in Acampo, CA and the Mission Bell Winery in Madera, CA.  These two facilities produce approximately 27 million cases (or 42%) of our product annually.  Much of our supply of Mexican beer is produced at the Brewery in Piedras Negras, Coahuila, Mexico.  Additionally, many of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities are located in areas which are prone to seismic activity.  If any of these vineyards and facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace the vineyard or facility.  If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.  In addition, since we have consolidated certain of our operations and various production and distribution facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption of our operations in the event of a catastrophic event in any one location, such as through acts of war or terrorism, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other natural or man-made disasters.  Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain insurance.  Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, certain catastrophes are not covered by our insurance policies as we believe this to be a prudent financial decision.  If our insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at greater risk that we may experience an adverse impact to our financial results.  We take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by a catastrophic event, but there is no certainty that our efforts would prove successful.  If one or more significant uninsured events occur, we could suffer a major financial loss.Our operations subject us to risks relating to doing business globally, currency rate fluctuations, interest rate fluctuations, and geopolitical uncertainty, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.In addition to our operations in the U.S., we have operations in Canada, New Zealand and Italy, our products are produced in various countries around the world and we sell our products in numerous countries throughout the world, and we have announced plans to enter into certain emerging markets over time.  Upon consummation of the pending Beer Business Acquisition, we will also have operations in Mexico.  Therefore, we are subject to risks associated with potential disruptions caused by changes in political, economic and social environments, including civil and political unrest, terrorism, local labor conditions and changes in laws, governmental regulations and policies in many countries outside the U.S.  We are also subject to U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad, including tax laws, anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and laws regarding the enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights.  Our success will 18Table of Contents                                        depend, in part, on our ability to overcome the challenges we encounter with respect to these factors and other matters generally affecting U.S. companies with global operations.  Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, business partners or agents will not violate our policies or take action determined to be in violation of the law.  Any determination that our operations or activities were not in compliance with applicable U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, interruptions of business, terminations of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal and equitable sanctions.  We are also exposed to risks associated with currency fluctuations and risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.  Currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies in the markets in which we do business have fluctuated in recent years and are likely to continue to do so in the future.  We manage our exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risks utilizing derivative instruments and other means to reduce those risks.  We could experience changes in our ability to hedge against or manage fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reducing those risks.  We could also be affected by nationalizations or unstable governments or legal systems or intergovernmental disputes.  These currency, economic and political uncertainties may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, especially to the extent these matters, or the decisions, policies or economic strength of our suppliers, affect our global operations. We have a significant amount of intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarks, and if we are required to write-down any of these intangible assets, it could materially reduce our net income.For the years ended February 29, 2012, and February 28, 2011, we recorded impairment losses of $38.1 million and $23.6 million, respectively, on certain of our intangible assets.  For the year ended February 28, 2013, no impairment losses were recorded.  We continue to have a significant amount of intangible assets such as goodwill and trademarks and may acquire more intangible assets in the future.  In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance for intangibles – goodwill and other, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to a periodic impairment evaluation.  The write-down of any of these intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our net income.The termination of our joint venture with Modelo relating to importing, marketing and selling imported beer could have a material adverse effect on our business.On January 2, 2007, we participated in establishing and commencing operations of a joint venture with Modelo, pursuant to which Corona Extra and the other Modelo Brands are imported, marketed and sold by the joint venture in the U.S. (including the District of Columbia) and Guam.  Pursuant to the joint venture and related importation arrangements, the joint venture will continue for an initial term of 10 years, and renew in 10-year periods unless GModelo Corporation, a Delaware corporation and subsidiary of Diblo, gives notice prior to the end of year seven of any term of its intention to purchase our interest we hold through our subsidiary, Constellation Beers Ltd. (“Constellation Beers”).  The joint venture may also terminate under other circumstances involving action by governmental authorities, certain changes in control of us or Constellation Beers as well as in connection with certain breaches of the importation and related sub-license agreements, after notice and cure periods.The termination of the joint venture by acquisition of Constellation Beers’ interest or for other reasons noted above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  This risk should be eliminated if the Beer Business Acquisition is consummated.Class action or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse, the misuse of alcohol, product liability, or marketing or sales practices could adversely affect our business.There has been public attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry, which we believe is due to concern over problems related to harmful use of alcohol, including drinking and driving, underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol.  We also could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability or marketing or sales practices.  Adverse developments in lawsuits concerning these types of matters or a significant decline in the social acceptability of beverage alcohol products that results from lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business.19Table of Contents                                        Any damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.Maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our branded products.  Product contamination or tampering or the failure to maintain high standards for product quality, safety and integrity, including with respect to raw materials obtained from suppliers, may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.  Although we maintain standards for the materials and product components we receive from our suppliers, and we also audit our suppliers’ compliance with our standards, it is possible that a supplier may not provide materials or product components which meet our required standards or may falsify documentation associated with the fulfillment of those requirements.  If any of our products becomes unfit for consumption, is misbranded or causes injury, we may have to engage in a product recall and/or be subject to liability and incur additional costs.  A widespread product recall or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period of time, which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity.  Our reputation could be impacted negatively by public perception, adverse publicity (whether or not valid), or our responses relating to:•A perceived failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities;•A perceived failure to address concerns related to the quality, safety or integrity of our products;•Our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, packaging, water and energy use and waste management; or•Efforts that are perceived as insufficient to promote the responsible use of alcohol.Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls, to provide accurate and timely financial statement information, or to protect our information systems against service interruptions, misappropriation of data or breaches of security, could also hurt our reputation.  Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation, competitive position and brand equity.We depend upon our trademarks and proprietary rights, and any failure to protect our intellectual property rights or any claims that we are infringing upon the rights of others may adversely affect our competitive position and brand equity.Our future success depends significantly on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights.  We have been granted numerous trademark registrations covering our brands and products and have filed, and expect to continue to file, trademark applications seeking to protect newly-developed brands and products.  We cannot be sure that trademark registrations will be issued with respect to any of our trademark applications.  There is also a risk that we could, by omission, fail to timely renew or protect a trademark or that our competitors will challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us.Contamination could harm the integrity of, or consumer support for, our brands and adversely affect the sales of our products.The success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of those brands.  Contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for those brands, could adversely affect their sales.  Contaminants in raw materials purchased from third parties and used in the production of our wine and spirits products or defects in the distillation or fermentation process could lead to low beverage quality as well as illness among, or injury to, consumers of our products and may result in reduced sales of the affected brand or all of our brands.20Table of Contents                                        An increase in the cost of energy or the cost of environmental regulatory compliance could affect our profitability.We have experienced increases in energy costs, and energy costs could continue to rise, which would result in higher transportation, freight and other operating costs.  We may experience significant future increases in the costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance, including fees, licenses, and the cost of capital improvements to our operating facilities in order to meet environmental regulatory requirements.  Our future operating expenses and margins will be dependent on our ability to manage the impact of cost increases.  We cannot guarantee that we will be able to pass along increased energy costs or increased costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance to our customers through increased prices.In addition, we may be party to various environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of our business or in connection with historical activities of businesses we acquire.  Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants in our current and former properties, the potential exists for remediation, liability and indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs that we have estimated.  We cannot assure you that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our projections or otherwise have an adverse effect upon our business reputation, financial condition or results of operations.Our reliance upon complex information systems distributed worldwide and our reliance upon third party global networks means we could experience breaches of security or interruptions to our business services.We depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers, as well as maintain financial accuracy and efficiency.  If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach.  As with all large information technology systems, our systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting confidential or proprietary information, corrupting our information, disrupting our business processes, or engaging in the unauthorized use of strategic information about us or our employees, customers or consumers.  Such unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in the loss of assets or revenues, litigation, remediation costs, damage to our reputation, or the failure by us to retain or attract customers following such an event.  Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.We have outsourced various functions to third-party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future.  We rely on those third-party service providers to provide services on a timely and effective basis.  Although we closely monitor the performance of these third parties and maintain contingency plans in case they are unable to perform as agreed, we do not ultimately control their performance.  Their failure to perform as expected or as required by contract could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow, and could impair our ability to make required filings with various reporting agencies on a timely or accurate basis.Changes in accounting standards and guidance and taxation requirements could affect our financial results.New accounting guidance that may become applicable to us from time to time, or changes in the interpretations of existing guidance, could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board and the International Accounting Standards Board continue to work towards a convergence of accounting standards.  Certain standards may become applicable to us and change the interpretation of existing guidance.  Such events could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods.  In addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions in which we operate.  Increases in indirect taxes could affect our products’ affordability and therefore reduce our sales.  We are also subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions in which we generate revenues.  Changes in tax laws, tax rates or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate.  Our tax liabilities are affected by the mix of pretax income or loss among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate.  We must exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, interest and penalties; accordingly, future events could change management’s assessment of these amounts.21Table of Contents                                        "
4,STZ,CONSTELLATION BRANDS,2012-04-30,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
.  Inaddition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The risks described below are not the onlyrisks we face. Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. Worldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions could adversely impact our financial performance. Although we believe the adverse worldwide and domestic economic conditions experienced over recent years are improving, the degree andpace of recovery is uncertain and is expected to vary around the globe. Worldwide and domestic economies remain subject to prolongation, exacerbation and expansion of adverse conditions. In addition, instability in global credit markets, includingthe uncertainty related to sovereign debt issues in certain countries in the European Union, the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world, and other disruptions, may continue to put pressure on global economicconditions. We are subject to risks associated with adverse economic conditions, including economic slowdown, inflation, and the disruption, volatility and tightening of credit and capital markets. In addition, unfavorable global or domestic economic situations could adversely impact our major suppliers, distributors and retailers.The inability of suppliers, distributors or retailers to conduct business or to access liquidity could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products. We have a committed credit facility and  9 Table of Contentsadditional liquidity facilities available to us. While to date we have not experienced problems with accessing these facilities, to the extent that the financial institutions that participate inthese facilities were to default on their obligation to fund, those funds would not be available to us.  The timing and natureof any recovery in the financial markets remains uncertain, and there can be no assurance that market conditions will improve in the near future. A prolonged downturn, further worsening or broadening of adverse conditions in the worldwide anddomestic economies, or return of high levels of inflation could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our products, and create or exacerbate credit issues, cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and for our suppliers,distributors, retailers and consumers. Depending upon their severity and duration, these conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. We are not able to predict the paceof recovery of the economies in the United States (U.S.) and our other major markets outside the U.S.  Our indebtedness couldhave a material adverse effect on our financial health.  We have incurred substantial indebtedness to finance ouracquisitions. In the future, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness to finance further acquisitions, additional repurchases of shares of our stock, and other general corporate purposes. Our ability to satisfy our debt obligationsoutstanding from time to time will depend upon our future operating performance. We do not have complete control over our future operating performance because it is subject to prevailing economic conditions, levels of interest rates and financial,business and other factors. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet all of our debt service requirements and to fund our general corporate capital requirements. Our current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have important consequences to you. These consequences include, ormay include, the following:      Our ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or acquisitions or other purposes may be limited;     Our funds available for operations, expansion or distributions will be reduced because we will dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow fromoperations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;      Our ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants; and     Our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than less leveraged competitors and, thus, our ability to withstand competitivepressures may be limited.  Restrictive covenants in our senior credit facility and in our indentures placelimits on our ability to conduct our business. Covenants in our senior credit facility include those that restrict our ability to make acquisitions, incur debt, create liens, sell assets, pay dividends, engage in mergers and consolidations, enterinto transactions with affiliates, make investments and permit our subsidiaries to enter into certain restrictive agreements. It additionally contains certain financial covenants, including a debt ratio test and an interest coverage ratio test.Covenants in our indentures are generally less restrictive than our senior credit facility but nevertheless, among other things, limit our ability under certain circumstances to create liens or enter into sale-leaseback transactions and imposeconditions on our ability to engage in mergers, consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.  Theseagreements also contain certain change of control provisions which, if triggered, may result in an acceleration of our obligation to repay the debt. If we fail to comply with the obligations contained in the senior credit facility, our existing orfuture indentures or other loan agreements, we could be in default under such agreements, which could require us to immediately repay the related debt and also debt under other agreements that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-defaultprovisions.  Our senior credit facility has a specific term of years and we will have to enter into a new facility or arenewal facility on or before the June 2013 maturation of the revolving portion of the senior credit facility. While we have been exploring a variety of alternatives in the credit and debt markets, there can be no assurance that the  10 Table of Contentsrate of interest, terms and covenants or other obligations that would be contained within any replacement facility will be equal to or better than those under our current senior credit facility.A refinancing on less advantageous terms may adversely affect our business and reduce our profitability.  Our acquisition, divestiture andjoint venture strategies may not be successful.  We have made a number of acquisitions and divestitures. We anticipate thatwe may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business and that we may divest ourselves of businesses, assets or securities of companies that webelieve no longer provide a strategic fit with our business. We will need to integrate acquired businesses with our existing operations; our overall internal control over financial reporting processes; and our financial, operations and informationsystems. We cannot assure you that we will effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or realize anticipated operational synergies. Integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companiesinto our existing operations or separating from our existing operations the operations and personnel of businesses of which we divest may result in difficulties, significant expense and accounting charges, disrupt our business or divertmanagements time and attention.  We recently acquired the remaining 50.1% interest in Ruffino S.r.l. and sold our valuespirits business, our U.K. cider business, and 80.1% of our Australian and U.K. business. In connection with the integration of acquired operations, the separation of divested businesses, or the conduct of our overall business strategies, we mayperiodically restructure our businesses, integrate or separate our financial, operations and/or information systems, reorganize the management and reporting relationships within our business and/or sell assets or portions of our business. We may notachieve expected cost savings or efficiencies from restructuring activities or realize the expected proceeds from sales of assets or portions of our business. Actual charges, costs and adjustments due to restructuring activities may vary materiallyfrom our estimates. We may provide various indemnifications in connection with the sale of assets or portions of our business. Additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in ouracquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates. We cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses will remain constant.  Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business. Inconnection with acquisitions or joint venture investments outside the U.S., we may enter into derivative contracts to purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against the risk of foreign currency fluctuations in connection with such acquisitionsor joint venture investments. This would subject us to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations associated with such derivative contracts.  We have also acquired or retained equity or membership interests in companies which we do not control, such as our retained less than 20% interest in certain companies that comprised our Australian andU.K. business. The other parties that hold the remaining equity or membership interests in these types of companies may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of thosecompanies. The arrangements through which we acquired or hold our equity or membership interests may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs or to purchase other parties interests. Our failure to adequately manage the risksassociated with any acquisition, or the failure of an entity in which we have an equity or membership interest, could adversely affect our financial condition or our valuation of these types of investments. We have entered into joint ventures, including our joint venture with Grupo Modelo S.A.B. de C.V. (Modelo) and our holdingsin Opus One Winery LLC, and we may enter into additional joint ventures. We share control of our joint ventures. Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals orthe goals of the joint venture. Our joint venture arrangements may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments. In addition, our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their economic or otherobligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. Our failure or the failure of an entity in which we have a joint venture interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have amaterial adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.   11 Table of ContentsWe cannot assure you that any of our acquisitions, investments or joint ventures will beprofitable or that forecasts regarding joint venture activities will be accurate. In particular, risks and uncertainties associated with our joint ventures include, among others, the joint ventures ability to operate its business successfully,the joint ventures ability to develop appropriate standards, controls, procedures and policies for the growth and management of the joint venture, and the strength of the joint ventures relationships with its employees, suppliers andcustomers.  Competition could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and unit volume of our sales could be negatively affected by our inabilityto maintain or increase prices, changes in geographic or product mix, a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption or the decision of wholesalers, retailers or consumers to purchase competitors products instead of our products.Wholesaler, retailer and consumer purchasing decisions are influenced by, among other things, the perceived absolute or relative overall value of our products, including their quality or pricing, compared to competitors products. Unit volumeand dollar sales could also be affected by pricing, purchasing, financing, operational, advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers, state and provincial agencies, and retailers which could affect their supply of, or consumer demandfor, our products. We could also experience higher than expected selling, general and administrative expenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising or marketing expenditures to maintain our competitiveposition or for other reasons.  An increase in import and excise duties or other taxes or government regulations could have a materialadverse effect on our business.  The U.S., Canada and other countries in which we operate impose import and excise dutiesand other taxes on beverage alcohol products in varying amounts which have been subject to change. Significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on beverage alcohol products could materially and adversely affect our financialcondition or results of operations. The U.S. federal budget and individual state, provincial or local municipal budget deficits could result in increased taxes on our products, business, customers or consumers. Various proposals to increase taxes onbeverage alcohol products have been made at the federal and state or provincial level in recent years. Many U.S. states have considered proposals to increase, and some of these states have increased, state alcohol excise taxes. There may be furtherconsideration by federal, state, provincial, local and foreign governmental entities to increase taxes upon beverage alcohol products as governmental entities explore available alternatives for raising funds during the current macroeconomic climate.In addition, federal, state, provincial, local and foreign governmental agencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol products industry concerning such matters as licensing, warehousing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and requiredlabeling, advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers. Certain federal, state or provincial regulations also require warning labels and signage. New or revised regulations or increased licensing fees, requirements or taxes could alsohave a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  Benefit cost increases could reduce our profitability. Our profitability is affected by employee medical costs and other employee benefits. In recent years, employee medicalcosts have increased due to factors such as the increase in health care costs in the U.S. These factors, plus the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in March 2010, will continue to put pressure on our business and financialperformance due to higher employee benefit costs. Although we actively seek to control increases in employee benefit costs and encourage employees to maintain healthy lifestyles to reduce future potential medical costs, there can be no assurancethat we will succeed in limiting future cost increases. Continued employee benefit cost increases could have an adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition. We also sponsor a very limited number of defined benefit plans that cover a limited number of our non-U.S. employees. Our costs ofproviding defined benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as   12 Table of Contentsdiscount rates, the rates of return on the plans assets, exchange rate fluctuations, future governmental regulation, global equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions tothe plans. Without sustained growth in pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans assets, and depending upon the other factors relating to worldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions, we couldbe required to increase funding for some or all of our defined benefit plans.  We rely on the performance of wholesale distributors, majorretailers and government agencies for the success of our business.  Local market structures and distribution channels varyworldwide. In the U.S., we sell our products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets including grocery stores, club and discount stores, package liquor stores and restaurants and also directly to government agencies, while in Canada,we sell our products principally to government agencies. In the U.S., we have entered into exclusive arrangements with certain wholesalers that generate a large portion of our U.S. net sales and we are looking to enter into a limited additionalnumber of exclusive wholesaler arrangements in additional areas of the U.S. The replacement or poor performance of our major wholesalers, retailers or government agencies could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financialcondition. Our inability to collect accounts receivable from our major wholesalers, retailers or government agencies could also materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the wholesale and retail distribution channels, particularly in theU.S. If we are unable to successfully adapt to this changing environment, our net income, market share and volume growth could be negatively affected. In addition, wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which compete directly withour products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases. Accordingly, wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products of our competitors. In the future, our wholesalers and retailers may not continue to purchase our products orprovide our products with adequate levels of promotional support.  Our business could be adversely affected by a decline in the consumptionof products we sell.  While over the past several years there have been modest increases in consumption of beverage alcoholin most of our product categories and geographic markets, there have been periods in the past in which there were substantial declines in the overall per capita consumption of beverage alcohol products in the U.S. and other markets in which weparticipate. A limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including:      A general decline in economic or geopolitical conditions;     Concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and driving;     A general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in on-premise establishments, such as may result from smoking bans and stricter lawsrelated to driving while under the influence of alcohol;      Consumer dietary preferences favoring lighter, lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks, sports drinks and water products;     The increased activity of anti-alcohol groups;      Increased federal, state, provincial or foreign excise or other taxes on beverage alcohol products and possible restrictions on beverage alcoholadvertising and marketing; and      Increased regulation placing restrictions on the purchase or consumption of beverage alcohol products.   13 Table of ContentsWe are primarily a branded consumer products company and we rely on consumers demandfor our products. Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including changes in demographic or social trends, public health policies, and changes in leisure, dining and beverage consumption patterns. Our continued success willrequire us to anticipate and respond effectively to shifts in consumer behavior and drinking tastes. If consumer preferences were to move away from our premium brands in any of our major markets, our financial results might be adversely affected.Other factors may also reduce consumer spending on our products, including economic declines, inflation, a trend towards frugality even as the economy improves, wars, pandemics, weather, and natural or man-made disasters. As the cost of gasoline andother petroleum-based products increases, consumers may not have as much discretionary funds available to buy our products. In addition, our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products. The launch and ongoing success of newproducts are inherently uncertain especially with regard to their appeal to consumers. The launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and an unsuccessful launch, among other things, can affect consumer perception of existing brandsand our reputation. Unsuccessful implementation or short-lived popularity of our product innovations may result in inventory write-offs and other costs.  Various diseases, pests and certain weather conditions could affect quality and quantity of grapes or other agricultural raw materials. Various diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, drought, frosts and certain other weather conditions could affect the quality and quantity ofgrapes and other agricultural raw materials available, decreasing the supply of our products and negatively impacting profitability. We cannot guarantee that our grape suppliers or suppliers of other agricultural raw materials will succeed inpreventing contamination in existing vineyards or fields or that we will succeed in preventing contamination in our existing vineyards or future vineyards we may acquire. Future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used ingrape growing may increase vineyard costs and/or reduce production. Growing agricultural raw materials also requires adequate water supplies. A substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines or othercrops, which could lead to a shortage of our product supply.  We generally purchase raw materials under short-term supply contracts, we aresubject to substantial price fluctuations for grapes and grape-related materials, and we have a limited group of suppliers of glass bottles.  Our business is heavily dependent upon raw materials, such as grapes, grape juice concentrate, grains, alcohol and packaging materials from third-party suppliers. We could experience raw material supply,production or shipment difficulties that could adversely affect our ability to supply goods to our customers. Increases in the costs of raw materials also directly affect us. In the past, we have experienced dramatic increases in the cost of grapes.Although we believe we have adequate sources of grape supplies, we could experience shortages if the demand for particular wine products exceeds expectations.  The wine industry swings between cycles of grape oversupply and undersupply. In a severe oversupply environment, the ability of wine producers, including ourselves, to raise prices is limited, and, incertain situations, the competitive environment may put pressure on producers to lower prices. Further, although an oversupply may enhance opportunities to purchase grapes at lower costs, a producers selling and promotional expenses associatedwith the sale of its wine products can rise in such an environment.  Glass bottle costs are one of our largest components ofcost of product sold. In the U.S. and Canada, glass bottles have only a small number of producers. Currently, one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our U.S. operations and another producer supplies substantially all ofour glass container requirements for our Canadian operations. The inability of any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements could adversely affect our business.   14 Table of ContentsClimate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affectour business, operations or financial performance, and water scarcity or poor quality could negatively impact our production costs and capacity.  Our business depends upon agricultural activity and natural resources. There has been much public discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may havean adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Severe weather events and climate change may negatively affect agricultural productivity in the regions from which wepresently source our agricultural raw materials such as grapes. Decreased availability of our raw materials may increase the cost of goods for our products. Severe weather events or changes in the frequency or intensity of weather events can alsodisrupt our supply chain, which may affect production operations, insurance cost and coverage, as well as delivery of our products to wholesalers, retailers and consumers.  Water is essential in the production of our products. The quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of grapes and our ability to operate our business. Water is a limitedresource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe, there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints. Such events couldadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Our operations subject us to risks relating to doing businessglobally, currency rate fluctuations, interest rate fluctuations, and geopolitical uncertainty, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  In addition to our operations in the U.S., we have operations in Canada, New Zealand and Italy, our products are produced in various countries around the world and we sell our products in numerouscountries throughout the world. Therefore, we are subject to risks associated with potential disruptions caused by changes in political, economic and social environments, including civil and political unrest, terrorism, local labor conditions andchanges in laws, governmental regulations and policies in many countries outside the U.S. We are also subject to U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad, including tax laws, anti-corruption laws and laws regarding the enforcementof contract and intellectual property rights. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to overcome the challenges we encounter with respect to these factors and other matters generally affecting U.S. companies with global operations. We arealso exposed to risks associated with currency fluctuations and risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. Currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies in the markets in which we do business have fluctuated in recentyears and are likely to continue to do so in the future. We manage our exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risks utilizing derivative instruments and other means to reduce those risks. We could experience changes in our ability to hedgeagainst or manage fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reducing those risks. We could also be affected by nationalizations or unstable governmentsor legal systems or intergovernmental disputes. These currency, economic and political uncertainties may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, especially to the extent these matters, or the decisions,policies or economic strength of our suppliers, affect our global operations.  We have a significant amount of intangible assets, such asgoodwill and trademarks, and if we are required to write-down any of these intangible assets, it would reduce our net income, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. During the years ended February 29, 2012, February 28, 2011, and February 28, 2010, we recorded impairment losses of$38.1 million, $23.6 million and $103.2 million, respectively, on certain of our intangible assets. We continue to have a significant amount of intangible assets such as goodwill and trademarks and may acquire more intangible assets in the future.In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidance for intangibles  goodwill and other, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to a periodic impairment evaluation. Reductions in our netincome caused by the write-down of any of these intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.   15 Table of ContentsThe termination of our joint venture with Modelo relating to importing, marketing and selling importedbeer could have a material adverse effect on our business.  On January 2, 2007, we participated in establishing andcommencing operations of a joint venture with Modelo, pursuant to which Corona Extra and the other Modelo Brands are imported, marketed and sold by the joint venture in the U.S. (including the District of Columbia) and Guam. Pursuant to the jointventure and related importation arrangements, the joint venture will continue for an initial term of 10 years, and renew in 10-year periods unless GModelo Corporation, a Delaware corporation and subsidiary of Diblo, gives notice prior to theend of year seven of any term of its intention to purchase our interest we hold through our subsidiary, Constellation Beers Ltd. (Constellation Beers). The joint venture may also terminate under other circumstances involving action bygovernmental authorities, certain changes in control of us or Constellation Beers as well as in connection with certain breaches of the importation and related sub-license agreements, after notice and cure periods. The termination of the joint venture by acquisition of Constellation Beers interest or for other reasons noted above could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  Class action or other litigation relating toalcohol abuse, the misuse of alcohol, product liability, or marketing or sales practices could adversely affect our business.  There has been public attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry, which we believe is due to concern over problems related to alcohol abuse, including drinking and driving, underage drinking andhealth consequences from the misuse of alcohol. We also could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability or marketing or sales practices. Adverse developments in lawsuits concerning these types of matters or a significant decline in thesocial acceptability of beverage alcohol products that results from lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Anydamage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. Maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our branded products. Product contamination or tampering or the failure tomaintain high standards for product quality, safety and integrity, including with respect to raw materials obtained from suppliers, may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. Although we maintain standards forthe materials and product components we receive from our suppliers, and we also audit our suppliers compliance with our standards, it is possible that a supplier may not provide materials or product components which meet our required standardsor may falsify documentation associated with the fulfillment of those requirements. If any of our products becomes unfit for consumption, is misbranded or causes injury, we may have to engage in a product recall and/or be subject to liability andincur additional costs. A widespread product recall or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period of time, which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity. Our reputation could beimpacted negatively by public perception, adverse publicity (whether or not valid), or our responses relating to:      A perceived failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities;     A perceived failure to address concerns related to the quality, safety or integrity of our products;     Our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, packaging, water and energy use and waste management; or     Efforts that are perceived as insufficient to promote the responsible use of alcohol. Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls, to provide accurate and timelyfinancial statement information, or to protect our information systems against service   16 Table of Contentsinterruptions, misappropriation of data or breaches of security, could also hurt our reputation. Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or otherreasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation, competitiveposition and brand equity.  We depend upon our trademarks and proprietary rights, and any failure to protect our intellectual propertyrights or any claims that we are infringing upon the rights of others may adversely affect our competitive position and brand equity.  Our future success depends significantly on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights. We have been granted numerous trademarkregistrations covering our brands and products and have filed, and expect to continue to file, trademark applications seeking to protect newly-developed brands and products. We cannot be sure that trademark registrations will be issued with respectto any of our trademark applications. There is also a risk that we could, by omission, fail to timely renew or protect a trademark or that our competitors will challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, orlicensed by, us.  Contamination could harm the integrity of or consumer support for our brands and adversely affect the sales of ourproducts.  The success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of those brands. Contamination,whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for those brands, could adversely affect their sales. Contaminants in raw materials purchased from third parties andused in the production of our wine and spirits products or defects in the distillation or fermentation process could lead to low beverage quality as well as illness among, or injury to, consumers of our products and may result in reduced sales ofthe affected brand or all of our brands.  An increase in the cost of energy or the cost of environmental regulatory compliance could affectour profitability.  We have experienced increases in energy costs, and energy costs could continue to rise, which wouldresult in higher transportation, freight and other operating costs. We may experience significant future increases in the costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance, including fees, licenses, and the cost of capital improvements toour operating facilities in order to meet environmental regulatory requirements. Our future operating expenses and margins will be dependent on our ability to manage the impact of cost increases. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to passalong increased energy costs or increased costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance to our customers through increased prices.  In addition, we may be party to various environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of our business or in connection with historical activities of businesses we acquire. Due toregulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants in our current and former properties, the potential exists for remediation, liability and indemnification costs to differ materially from thecosts that we have estimated. We cannot assure you that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our projections or otherwise have an adverse effect upon our business reputation, financial condition or results of operations. Our reliance upon complex information systems distributed worldwide and our reliance upon third party global networks means we couldexperience breaches of security or interruptions to our business services.  We depend on information technology to enableus to operate efficiently and interface with customers, as well as maintain financial accuracy and efficiency. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we couldbe subject to transaction errors,   17 Table of Contentsprocessing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach. As with all large information technologysystems, our systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting confidential or proprietary information, corrupting our information, disrupting our business processes, or engaging in the unauthorized use of strategic informationabout us or our employees, customers or consumers. Such unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in the loss of assets or revenues, litigation, remediation costs, damage to our reputation, or the failure by us toretain or attract customers following such an event. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  We have outsourced various functions to third-party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future. We rely on those third-party service providers to provide services on a timely andeffective basis. Although we closely monitor the performance of these third parties and maintain contingency plans in case they are unable to perform as agreed, we do not ultimately control their performance. Their failure to perform as expected oras required by contract could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow, and could impair our ability to make required filings withvarious reporting agencies on a timely or accurate basis.  Changes in accounting standards and guidance and taxation requirements couldaffect our financial results.  New accounting guidance that may become applicable to us from time to time, or changes inthe interpretations of existing guidance, could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods. The Financial Accounting Standards Board and the International Accounting Standards Board continue to work towards aconvergence of accounting standards. Certain standards may become applicable to us and change the interpretation of existing guidance. Such events could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods. In addition, ourproducts are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in indirect taxes could affect our products affordability and therefore reduce our sales. We are alsosubject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions in which we generate revenues. Changes in tax laws, tax rates or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Our tax liabilities are affected by the mix of pretaxincome or loss among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We must exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, interest and penalties; accordingly, future events could change managements assessment of theseamounts.  Risks generally associated with building and sustaining our information technology infrastructure or implementation of ourintegrated technology platform may adversely affect our business and results of operations or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.  We have undertaken a comprehensive, multi-year business transformation initiative that we call Project Fusion. Project Fusion is our effort to create, design, implement and migrate certain of ourfinancial processing systems to an enterprise-wide systems solution intended to improve our reporting capabilities and cost efficiencies. It is a planned initiative that includes an integrated technology platform intended to improve theaccessibility of information, the visibility of global data, further enhance operating efficiencies and provide more effective management of our business operations. Enterprise resource planning system projects, such as Project Fusion, are complexand time-consuming projects that can involve substantial expenditures for system hardware, software, management focus and implementation activities that can continue for several years. There can be no certainty that Project Fusion will deliver theexpected benefits. The failure to deliver our goals may impact our ability to (1) process transactions accurately and efficiently and (2) remain in step with the changing needs of the trade, which could result in the loss of customers. Inaddition, the failure to either deliver system and process upgrades on time, or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs, could lead to increased costs, business disruption and loss of customers and revenue. Project Fusion includes an upgrade to our existing business accounting and journal entry system. This upgrade is being deployed for usethroughout our company in various go-live phases which began in the third   18 Table of Contentsquarter of Fiscal 2012 and are planned to continue throughout Fiscal 2013. Upgrading an accounting system and conversion to a new information technology platform is costly and involves risksinherent in the conversion to the upgraded system, including potential loss of information, disruption to our normal operations, changes in accounting procedures and internal control over financial reporting, as well as problems achieving accuracyin the conversion of electronic data. Implementation risks also include a potential increase in costs, the diversion of managements and employees attention and resources, and a potentially adverse effect on our operating results,internal controls over financial reporting and ability to manage our business effectively. Throughout Project Fusion we have expended resources which are intended to properly and adequately address these issues and have instituted additionalmanagement controls relating to internal control over financial reporting and implementation risks. While Project Fusion is intended to further improve and enhance our information systems, it exposes us to the risks of integrating the systemupgrades with our existing systems and processes. Disruption of our financial reporting could impair our ability to make required filings with various reporting agencies on a timely or accurate basis.  "
11,STZ,CONSTELLATION BRANDS,2011-04-29,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
.          In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully considerthe following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results ofoperations. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional factors notpresently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adverselyaffect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.Worldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions could adversely impact ourfinancial performance.          Although we believe the severe worldwide and domestic economic conditions experienced overrecent years have improved, the degree and pace of recovery is uncertain and is expected to varyaround the globe. Worldwide and domestic economies remain subject to prolongation, exacerbationand expansion of adverse conditions. We are subject to risks associated with adverse economicconditions, including economic slowdown, inflation, and the disruption, volatility and tighteningof credit and capital markets.          In addition, adverse global or domestic economic situations could adversely impact our majorsuppliers, distributors and retailers. The inability of suppliers, distributors or retailers toconduct business or to access liquidity could impact our ability to produce and distribute ourproducts. We have a committed credit facility and additional liquidity facilities available to us.While to date we have not experienced problems with accessing these facilities, to the extent thatthe financial institutions that participate in these facilities were to default on their obligationto fund, those funds would not be available to us.9Table of Contents          The timing and nature of any recovery in the financial markets remains uncertain, and therecan be no assurance that market conditions will improve in the near future. A prolonged downturn,further worsening or broadening of the adverse conditions in the worldwide and domestic economies,or return of high levels of inflation could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of ourproducts, and create or exacerbate credit issues, cash flow issues and other financial hardshipsfor us and for our suppliers, distributors, retailers and consumers. Depending upon their severityand duration, these conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity,financial condition and results of operations. We are not able to predict the pace of recovery of the recent adverseeconomic conditions in the United States and our other major markets outside the United States.Our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our financial health.          We have incurred substantial indebtedness to finance our acquisitions. In the future, we mayincur substantial additional indebtedness to finance further acquisitions, the buyback of ourshares or for other purposes. Our ability to satisfy our debt obligations outstanding from time totime will depend upon our future operating performance. We do not have complete control over ourfuture operating performance because it is subject to prevailing economic conditions, levels ofinterest rates and financial, business and other factors. We cannot assure you that our businesswill generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet all of our debt service requirements andto fund our capital expenditure requirements.          Our current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have importantconsequences to you. These consequences include, or may include, the following:  Our ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or acquisitions orother purposes may be limited;   Our funds available for operations, expansion or distributions will be reducedbecause we will dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to thepayment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;   Our ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants; and   Our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than less leveragedcompetitors and, thus, our ability to withstand competitive pressures may be limited.          Our senior credit facility and the indentures under which our debt securities have been issuedcontain restrictive covenants. These covenants affect our ability to, among other things, grantliens and restrict changes of control and certain other fundamental changes. Our senior creditfacility also contains covenants that restrict our ability to make acquisitions, incur debt, sellassets, pay dividends, enter into transactions with affiliates and make investments. It alsocontains certain financial covenants, including a debt ratio test and an interest coverage ratiotest. These covenants could limit our ability to conduct business. If we fail to comply with theobligations contained in the senior credit facility, our existing or future indentures or otherloan agreements, we could be in default under such agreements, which could require us toimmediately repay the related debt and also debt under other agreements that may containcross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.10Table of ContentsOur acquisition, divestiture and joint venture strategies may not be successful.          We have made a number of acquisitions and we anticipate that we may, from time to time,acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe would provide astrategic fit with our business. We will need to integrate acquired businesses with our existingoperations. We cannot assure you that we will effectively assimilate the business or productofferings of acquired companies into our business or realize anticipated operational synergies.Integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our existing operations orseparating from our existing operations the operations and personnel of businesses of which wedivest may result in difficulties, significant expense and accounting charges, disrupt our businessor divert managements time and attention. In connection with the integration of acquiredoperations or the conduct of our overall business strategies, we may periodically restructure ourbusinesses and/or sell assets or portions of our business, including the recent sales of 80.1% ofour Australian and U.K. business, our U.K. cider business and our value spirits business. We maynot achieve expected cost savings or efficiencies from restructuring activities or realize theexpected proceeds from sales of assets or portions of our business, and actual charges, costs andadjustments due to restructuring activities may vary materially from our estimates. We may providevarious indemnifications in connection with the sale of assets or portions of our business.Additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the fair value of assets acquired andliabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates. We cannotassure you that the fair value of acquired businesses will remain constant.          Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to unknown liabilitiesof acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquiredbusiness. In connection with acquisitions or joint venture investments outside the U.S., we mayenter into derivative contracts to purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against the risk offoreign currency fluctuations in connection with such acquisitions or joint venture investments,which subjects us to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations associated with such derivativecontracts.          We have also acquired or retained equity or membership interests in companies which we do notcontrol, such as our holdings in Ruffino S.r.l. and our retained 19.9% interest in certaincompanies that comprised our Australian and U.K. business. The other parties that hold theremaining equity or membership interests in these types of companies may at any time have economic,business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of thosecompanies. The arrangements through which we acquired or hold our equity or membership interestsmay require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs or to purchase other parties interests. Ourfailure to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisition, or the failure of an entityin which we have an equity or membership interest, could adversely affect our financial conditionor our valuation of these types of investments.          We have entered into joint ventures, including our joint venture with Modelo and our holdingsin Opus One Winery LLC, and we may enter into additional joint ventures. We share control of ourjoint ventures. Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legalinterests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint venture. Ourjoint venture arrangements may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs or to makecertain capital investments. In addition, our joint venture partners may be unable to meet theireconomic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. Ourfailure or the failure of an entity in which we have a joint venture interest to adequately managethe risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effecton our financial condition or results of operations.11Table of Contents          We cannot assure you that any of our acquisitions, investments or joint ventures will beprofitable or that forecasts regarding joint venture activities will be accurate. In particular,risks and uncertainties associated with our joint ventures include, among others, the jointventures ability to operate its business successfully, the joint ventures ability to developappropriate standards, controls, procedures and policies for the growth and management of the jointventure and the strength of the joint ventures relationships with its employees, suppliers andcustomers.Competition could have a material adverse effect on our business.          We are in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and unit volume of our salescould be negatively affected by our inability to maintain or increase prices, changes in geographicor product mix, a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption or the decision of wholesalers,retailers or consumers to purchase competitive products instead of our products. Wholesaler,retailer and consumer purchasing decisions are influenced by, among other things, the perceivedabsolute or relative overall value of our products, including their quality or pricing, compared tocompetitive products. Unit volume and dollar sales could also be affected by pricing, purchasing,financing, operational, advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers, state andprovincial agencies, and retailers which could affect their supply of, or consumer demand for, ourproducts. We could also experience higher than expected selling, general and administrativeexpenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising ormarketing expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasons.An increase in import and excise duties or other taxes or government regulations could have amaterial adverse effect on our business.          The U.S., Canada and other countries in which we operate impose import and excise duties andother taxes on beverage alcohol products in varying amounts which have been subject to change.Significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on beverage alcohol products couldmaterially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Many U.S. stateshave considered proposals to increase, and some of these states have increased, state alcoholexcise taxes. There may be further consideration by governmental entities to increase taxes uponbeverage alcohol products as governmental entities explore available alternatives for raising fundsduring the current macroeconomic climate. In addition, federal, state, local and foreigngovernmental agencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol products industry concerning suchmatters as licensing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and required labeling, advertising andrelations with wholesalers and retailers. Certain federal and state or provincial regulations alsorequire warning labels and signage. New or revised regulations or increased licensing fees,requirements or taxes could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition orresults of operations.Benefit cost increases could reduce our profitability.          Our profitability is affected by employee medical costs and other employeebenefits. In recent years, employee medical costs have increased due to factors such as theincrease in health care costs in the U.S. These factors, plus the enactment of the PatientProtection and Affordable Care Act in March 2010, will continue to put pressure on our business andfinancial performance due to higher employee benefit costs. Although we actively seek to controlincreases in employee benefit costs and encourage employees to maintain healthy lifestyles toreduce future potential medical costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limitingfuture cost increases. Continued employee benefit cost increases could have an adverse affect onour results of operations and financial condition.12Table of Contents          We also sponsor a very limited number of defined benefit plans that cover some of our non-U.S.employees. Our costs of providing defined benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors,such as discount rates, the rates of return on the plans assets, exchange rate fluctuations,future governmental regulation, global equity prices, and our required and/or voluntarycontributions to the plans. Without sustained growth in pension investments over time to increasethe value of the plans assets, and depending upon the other factors relating to worldwide anddomestic economic trends and financial market conditions, we could be required to increase fundingfor some or all of our defined benefit plans.We rely on the performance of wholesale distributors, major retailers and government agencies forthe success of our business.          Local market structures and distribution channels vary worldwide. In the U.S., we sell ourproducts principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets including grocery stores, club anddiscount stores, package liquor stores and restaurants and also directly to government agencies,while in Canada, we sell our products principally to government agencies. In the U.S., we haveentered into exclusive arrangements with certain wholesalers thatgenerate a large portion of ourU.S. net sales. The replacement or poor performance of our major wholesalers, retailers orgovernment agencies could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financialcondition. Our inability to collect accounts receivable from our major wholesalers, retailers orgovernment agencies could also materially and adversely affect our results of operations andfinancial condition.          The industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the wholesale and retaildistribution channels, particularly in the U.S. If we are unable to successfully adapt to thischanging environment, our net income, market share and volume growth could be negatively affected.In addition, wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which compete directly withour products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases. Accordingly, wholesalers or retailersmay give higher priority to products of our competitors. In the future, our wholesalers andretailers may not continue to purchase our products or provide our products with adequate levels ofpromotional support.Our business could be adversely affected by a decline in the consumption of products we sell.          While over the past several years there have been modest increases in consumption of beveragealcohol in most of our product categories and geographic markets, there have been periods in thepast in which there were substantial declines in the overall per capita consumption of beveragealcohol products in the U.S. and other markets in which we participate. A limited or generaldecline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to avariety of factors, including:  A general decline in economic or geo-political conditions;   Increased concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcoholproducts and about drinking and driving;   A general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in on-premiseestablishments, such as may result from smoking bans and stricter laws related todriving while under the influence of alcohol;   A trend toward a healthier diet including lighter, lower calorie beverages such asdiet soft drinks, sports drinks and water products;   The increased activity of anti-alcohol groups;   Increased federal, state, provincial or foreign excise or other taxes on beveragealcohol products; and   Increased regulation placing restrictions on the purchase or consumption of beveragealcohol products.13Table of Contents          We are primarily a branded consumer products company and we rely on consumers demand for ourproducts. Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including changes indemographic or social trends, public health policies, and changes in leisure, dining and beverageconsumption patterns. Our continued success will require us to anticipate and respond effectivelyto shifts in consumer behavior and drinking tastes. If consumer preferences were to move away fromour premium brands in any of our major markets, our financial results might be adversely affected.Other factors may also reduce consumer spending on our products, including economic declines,inflation, a trend towards frugality even as the economy improves, wars, pandemics, weather, andnatural or man-made disasters. As the cost of gasoline and other petroleum-based productsincreases, consumers may not have as much discretionary funds available to buy our products.          In addition, our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to develop newproducts. The launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain especially withregard to their appeal to consumers. The launch of a new product can give rise to a variety ofcosts and an unsuccessful launch, among other things, can affect consumer perception of existingbrands. Unsuccessful implementation or short-lived popularity of our product innovations mayresult in inventory write-offs and other costs.We generally purchase raw materials under short-term supply contracts, and we are subject tosubstantial price fluctuations for grapes and grape-related materials, and we have a limited groupof suppliers of glass bottles.          Our business is heavily dependent upon raw materials, such as grapes, grape juice concentrate,grains, alcohol and packaging materials from third-party suppliers. We could experience rawmaterial supply, production or shipment difficulties that could adversely affect our ability tosupply goods to our customers. Increases in the costs of raw materials also directly affect us. Inthe past, we have experienced dramatic increases in the cost of grapes. Although we believe wehave adequate sources of grape supplies, we could experience shortages if the demand for particularwine products exceeds expectations.          The wine industry swings between cycles of grape oversupply and undersupply. In a severeoversupply environment, the ability of wine producers, including ourselves, to raise prices islimited, and, in certain situations, the competitive environment may put pressure on producers tolower prices. Further, although an oversupply may enhance opportunities to purchase grapes atlower costs, a producers selling and promotional expenses associated with the sale of its wineproducts can rise in such an environment.          Glass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold. In the U.S. andCanada, glass bottles have only a small number of producers. Currently, one producer supplies mostof our glass container requirements for our U.S. operations and another producer suppliessubstantially all of our glass container requirements for our Canadian operations. The inabilityof any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements could adversely affect ourbusiness.14Table of ContentsClimate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, may negativelyaffect our business, operations or financial performance, and water scarcity or poor quality couldnegatively impact our production costs and capacity.          Our business depends upon agricultural activity and natural resources. There has been muchpublic discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in theatmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequencyand severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Severe weather events and climate changemay negatively affect agricultural productivity in the regions from which we presently source ouragricultural raw materials such as grapes. Decreased availability of our raw materials mayincrease the cost of goods for our products. Changes in frequency or intensity of weather can alsodisrupt our supply chain, which may affect production operations, insurance cost and coverage, aswell as delivery of our products to wholesalers, retailers and consumers. Water is essential inthe production of our products and the quality and quantity of water available for use is importantto the supply of grapes and our ability to operate our business. Water is a limited resource inmany parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe, there maybe a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or imposecapacity constraints. Such events could adversely affect our results of operations and financialcondition.Our operations subject us to risks relating to currency rate fluctuations, interest ratefluctuations and geopolitical uncertainty which could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness.          We have operations in Canada and New Zealand, our products are produced in various countriesaround the world and we sell our products in numerous countries throughout the world. Therefore,we are subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations. We are also exposed to risksassociated with interest rate fluctuations. We manage our exposure to foreign currency andinterest rate risks utilizing derivative instruments and other means to reduce those risks. Wecould experience changes in our ability to hedge against or manage fluctuations in foreign currencyexchange rates or interest rates and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will besuccessful in reducing those risks. We could also be affected by nationalizations or unstablegovernments or legal systems or intergovernmental disputes. These currency, economic and politicaluncertainties may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financialcondition, especially to the extent these matters, or the decisions, policies or economic strengthof our suppliers, affect our global operations.We have a material amount of intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarks, and if we arerequired to write-down any of these intangible assets, it would reduce our net income, which inturn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.          During the years ended February 28, 2011, February 28, 2010, and February 28, 2009, werecorded impairment losses of $23.6 million, $103.2 million and $300.4 million, respectively, onour goodwill and/or other intangible assets. We continue to have a significant amount ofintangible assets such as goodwill and trademarks and may acquire more intangible assets in thefuture. In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidance forintangibles  goodwill and other, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to aperiodic impairment evaluation. Reductions in our net income caused by the write-down of any ofthese intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations andfinancial condition.15Table of ContentsThe termination of our joint venture with Modelo relating to importing, marketing and sellingimported beer could have a material adverse effect on our business.          On January 2, 2007, we participated in establishing and commencing operations of a jointventure with Modelo, pursuant to which Corona Extra and the other Modelo Brands are imported,marketed and sold by the joint venture in the U.S. (including the District of Columbia) and Guamalong with certain other imported beer brands in their respective territories. Pursuant to thejoint venture and related importation arrangements, the joint venture will continue for an initialterm of 10 years, and renew in 10-year periods unless GModelo Corporation, a Delaware corporationand subsidiary of Diblo, gives notice prior to the end of year seven of any term of its intentionto purchase our interest we hold through our subsidiary, Constellation Beers Ltd. (ConstellationBeers). The joint venture may also terminate under other circumstances involving action bygovernmental authorities, certain changes in control of us or Constellation Beers as well as inconnection with certain breaches of the importation and related sub-license agreements, afternotice and cure periods.          The termination of the joint venture by acquisition of Constellation Beers interest or forother reasons noted above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditionor results of operations.Class action or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse, the misuse of alcohol, productliability or marketing or sales practices could adversely affect our business.          There has been  public attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry, which webelieve is due to concern over problems related to alcohol abuse, including drinking and driving,underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol. We also could be exposed tolawsuits relating to product liability or marketing or sales practices. Adverse developments inlawsuits concerning these types of matters or a significant decline in the social acceptability ofbeverage alcohol products that results from lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness.Any damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operation.          Maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our branded products. Productcontamination or tampering or the failure to maintain high standards for product quality, safetyand integrity, including with respect to raw materials obtained from suppliers, may reduce demandfor our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. If any of our products becomesunfit for consumption, misbranded or causes injury, we may have to engage in a product recalland/or be subject to liability. A widespread product recall or a significant product liabilityjudgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period of time, which could furtherreduce consumer demand and brand equity. Our reputation could be impacted negatively by publicperception, adverse publicity (whether or not valid), or our responses relating to:  A perceived failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental standards for allof our operations and activities;   Our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, packaging, water andenergy use and waste management; or   Efforts that are perceived as insufficient to promote the responsible use of alcohol.16Table of Contents          Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internalcontrols or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt ourreputation. Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any ofthese or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as requireadditional resources to rebuild our reputation, competitive position and brand equity.We depend upon our trademarks and proprietary rights, and any failure to protect our intellectualproperty rights or any claims that we are infringing upon the rights of others may adversely affectour competitive position and brand equity.          Our future success depends significantly on our ability to protect our current and futurebrands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights. We have been granted numeroustrademark registrations covering our brands and products and have filed, and expect to continue tofile, trademark applications seeking to protect newly-developed brands and products. We cannot besure that trademark registrations will be issued with respect to any of our trademark applications.There is also a risk that we could, by omission, fail to timely renew or protect a trademark orthat our competitors will challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarksissued to, or licensed by, us.Contamination could harm the integrity of or consumer support for our brands and adversely affectthe sales of our products.          The success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of those brands.Contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or otherevents that harm the integrity or consumer support for those brands, could adversely affect theirsales. Contaminants in raw materials purchased from third parties and used in the production ofour wine and spirits products or defects in the distillation or fermentation process could lead tolow beverage quality as well as illness among, or injury to, consumers of our products and mayresult in reduced sales of the affected brand or all of our brands.An increase in the cost of energy or the cost of environmental regulatory compliance could affectour profitability.          We have experienced significant increases in energy costs, and energy costs could continue torise, which would result in higher transportation, freight and other operating costs. We mayexperience significant future increases in the costs associated with environmental regulatorycompliance. Our future operating expenses and margins will be dependent on our ability to managethe impact of cost increases. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to pass along increasedenergy costs or increased costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance to ourcustomers through increased prices.          In addition, we may be party to various environmental remediation obligations arising in thenormal course of our business or in connection with historical activities of businesses we acquire.Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentifiedcontaminants in our current and former properties, the potential exists for remediation, liabilityand indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs that we have estimated. We cannotassure you that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our projections or otherwisehave an adverse effect upon our business reputation, financial condition or results of operations.17Table of ContentsOur reliance upon complex information systems distributed worldwide and our reliance upon thirdparty global networks means we could experience interruptions to our business services.          We depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface withcustomers, as well as maintain financial accuracy and efficiency. If we do not allocate, andeffectively manage, the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technologyinfrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss ofcustomers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through securitybreach. As with all large systems, our information systems could be penetrated by outside partiesintent on extracting information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes. Suchunauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in the loss of assetsand have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.          We have outsourced various functions to third-party service providers and may outsourceother functions in the future. We rely on those third-party service providers to provideservices on a timely and effective basis. Although we closely monitor the performance ofthese third parties and maintain contingency plans in case they are unable to perform asagreed, we do not ultimately control their performance. Their failure to perform asexpected or as required by contract could result in significant disruptions and costs to ouroperations, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, operatingresults and cash flow, and could impair our ability to make required filings with variousreporting agencies on a timely or accurate basis.Changes in accounting standards and guidance and taxation requirements could affect our financialresults.          New accounting guidance that may become applicable to us from time to time, or changes in theinterpretations of existing guidance, could have a significant effect on our reported results forthe affected periods. The Financial Accounting Standards Board and the International AccountingStandards Board continue to work towards a convergence of accounting standards. Certain standardsmay become applicable to us and change the interpretation of existing guidance. Such events couldhave a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods. In addition, ourproducts are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in manyjurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in indirect taxes could affect our productsaffordability and therefore reduce our sales. We are also subject to income tax in numerousjurisdictions in which we generate revenues. Changes in tax laws, tax rates or tax rulings may havea significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Our tax liabilities are affected by themix of pretax income or loss among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We must exercisejudgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, interest and penalties;accordingly, future events could change managements assessment of these amounts.Various diseases, pests and certain weather conditions could affect quality and quantity of grapesor other agricultural raw materials.          Various diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, drought, frosts and certain other weather conditionscould affect the quality and quantity of grapes and other agricultural raw materials available,decreasing the supply of our products and negatively impacting profitability. We cannot guaranteethat our grape suppliers or suppliers of other agricultural raw materials will succeed inpreventing contamination in existing vineyards or fields or that we will succeed in preventingcontamination in our existing vineyards or future vineyards we may acquire. Future governmentrestrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in grape growing may increase vineyardcosts and/or reduce production. Growing agricultural raw materials also requires adequate watersupplies. A substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape cropsand vines or other crops, which could lead to a shortage of our product supply.18Table of ContentsRisks generally associated with building and sustaining our information technology infrastructureor implementation of our integrated technology platform may adversely affect our business andresults of operations or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.          We have undertaken a comprehensive, multi-year business transformation initiative that we callProject Fusion. Project Fusion is our effort to create, design, implement and migrate certain ofour financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide systems solution intended to improve ourreporting capabilities and cost efficiencies. It is a planned initiative that will include anintegrated technology platform intended to improve the accessibility of information, the visibilityof global data, further enhance operating efficiencies and provide more effective management of ourbusiness operations. Enterprise resource planning system projects, such as Project Fusion, arecomplex and time-consuming projects that can involve substantial expenditures for system hardware,software, management focus and implementation activities that can continue for several years.There can be no certainty that Project Fusion will deliver the expected benefits. The failure todeliver our goals may impact our ability to (1) process transactions accurately and efficiently and(2) remain in step with the changing needs of the trade, which could result in the loss ofcustomers. In addition, the failure to either deliver system and process upgrades on time, oranticipate the necessary readiness and training needs, could lead to business disruption and lossof customers and revenue.          Project Fusion will include an upgrade to our existing business accounting and journal entrysystem. This upgrade will be deployed for use throughout our company in various go live phasestargeted to begin in the second quarter of Fiscal 2012. Upgrading an accounting system andconversion to a new information technology platform is costly and involves risks inherent in theconversion to the upgraded system, including potential loss of information, disruption to ournormal operations, changes in accounting procedures and internal control over financial reporting,as well as problems achieving accuracy in the conversion of electronic data. Although we areexpending resources which are intended to properly or adequately address these issues,implementation risks include a potential increase in costs, the diversion of managements andemployees attention and resources and a potentially adverse affect on our operating results,internal controls over financial reporting and ability to manage our business effectively. WhileProject Fusion is intended to further improve and enhance our information systems, it exposes us tothe risks of integrating the system upgrades with our existing systems and processes. Disruptionof our financial reporting could impair our ability to make requiredfilings with various reporting agencies on a timely or accurate basis"
5,STZ,CONSTELLATION BRANDS,2010-04-29,">Item 1A.     Risk Factors
.          In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully considerthe following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results ofoperations. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional factors notpresently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adverselyaffect our business operations.Worldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions could adverselyimpact our financial performance and the investment performance ofpension plan holdings.          As widely reported, the worldwide and domestic economies have experienced adverse conditionsand may be subject to further deterioration for the foreseeable future. We are subject to risksassociated with these adverse conditions, including economic slowdown and the disruption,volatility and tightening of credit and capital markets.          In addition, this global economic situation could adversely impact our major suppliers,distributors and retailers. The inability of suppliers, distributors or retailers to conductbusiness or to access liquidity could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products.We have a committed credit facility and additional liquidity facilities available to us. While todate we have not experienced problems with accessing these facilities, to the extent that thefinancial institutions that participate in these facilities were to default on their obligation tofund, those funds would not be available to us.          We also sponsor a limited number of defined benefit plans that cover some of our non-U.S. employees. Our costs of providing defined benefitplans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as discount rates, the rates of return on the plans assets,exchange rate fluctuations, future governmental regulation, global equity prices, and our required and/or voluntarycontributions to the plans. The obligations of certain of these defined benefit pension plans exceed the value of the plansassets and we continue to service these obligations as appropriate. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time toincrease the value of the plans assets, and depending upon the other factors listed above, we could be required to increase funding for some or all of these plans.          The timing and nature of any recovery in the financial markets remains uncertain, and therecan be no assurance that market conditions will improve in the near future. A prolonged downturn,further worsening or broadening of the adverse conditions in the worldwide and domestic economiescould affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our products, and create or exacerbatecredit issues, cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and for our suppliers,distributors, retailers and consumers, as well as further reducedefined benefit pension plan assets. Depending upon their severity and duration, theseconditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition andresults of operations. The Company is unable to predict the likely duration and severity of thecurrent disruption in the financial markets and the adverse economic conditions in the UnitedStates and its other major markets outside the United States.Our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our financial health.          We have incurred substantial indebtedness to finance our acquisitions. In the future, we mayincur substantial additional indebtedness to finance further acquisitions or for other purposes.Our ability to satisfy our debt obligations outstanding from time to time will depend upon ourfuture operating performance. We do not have complete control over our future operatingperformance because it is subject to prevailing economic conditions, levels of interest rates andfinancial, business and other factors. We cannot assure you that our business will generatesufficient cash flow from operations to meet all of our debt service requirements and to fund ourcapital expenditure requirements.10Table of Contents          Our current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have importantconsequences to you. These consequences include, or may include, the following:  Our ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or acquisitions orother purposes may be limited;  Our funds available for operations, expansion or distributions will be reducedbecause we will dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to thepayment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;  Our ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants; and  Our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than less leveragedcompetitors and, thus, our ability to withstand competitive pressures may be limited.          Our senior credit facility and the indentures under which our debt securities have been issuedcontain restrictive covenants. These covenants affect our ability to, among other things, grantliens and restrict changes of control and certain other fundamental changes. Our senior creditfacility also contains covenants that restrict our ability to make acquisitions, incur debt, sellassets, pay dividends, enter into transactions with affiliates and make investments. It alsocontains certain financial covenants, including a debt ratio test and an interest coverage ratiotest. These covenants could limit our ability to conduct business. If we fail to comply with theobligations contained in the senior credit facility, our existing or future indentures or otherloan agreements, we could be in default under such agreements, which could require us toimmediately repay the related debt and also debt under other agreements that may containcross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.Our acquisition, divestiture and joint venture strategies may not be successful.          We have made a number of acquisitions, including our acquisition of the Fortune Brands, Inc.U.S. wine business and our SVEDKA acquisition, and we anticipate that we may, from time to time,acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe would provide astrategic fit with our business. We will need to integrate acquired businesses with our existingoperations. We cannot assure you that we will effectively assimilate the business or productofferings of acquired companies into our business or product offerings or realize anticipatedoperational synergies. Integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into ourexisting operations or separating from our existing operations the operations and personnel ofbusinesses of which we divest may result in difficulties, significant expense and accountingcharges, disrupt our business or divert managements time and attention. In connection with theintegration of acquired operations or the conduct of our overall business strategies, we mayperiodically restructure our businesses and/or sell assets or portions of our business, includingthe recent sales of our U.K. cider business and the value spirits business. Wemay not achieve expected cost savings from restructuring activities or realize the expectedproceeds from sales of assets or portions of our business, and actual charges, costs andadjustments due to restructuring activities may vary materially from our estimates. Additionally,our final determinations and appraisals of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilitiesassumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates. We cannot assure you thatthe fair value of acquired businesses will remain constant.          Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to unknown liabilitiesof acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquiredbusiness. In connection with acquisitions or joint venture investments outside the U.S., we mayenter into derivative contracts to purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against the risk offoreign currency fluctuations in connection with such acquisitions or joint venture investments,which subjects us to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations associated with such derivativecontracts.11Table of Contents          We have entered into joint ventures, including our joint venture with Modelo and our jointventure with Punch, and we may enter into additional joint ventures. We share control of our jointventures. Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests orgoals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint venture. Our joint venturearrangements may require us to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments and we mayhave little control over the amount or the timing of these payments and investments. In addition,our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may berequired to fulfill those obligations alone. Our failure or the failure of an entity in which wehave a joint venture interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions orjoint ventures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results ofoperations. We cannot assure you that any of our acquisitions or joint ventures will be profitableor that forecasts regarding joint venture activities will be accurate. In particular, risks anduncertainties associated with our joint ventures include, among others, the joint ventures abilityto operate its business successfully, the joint ventures ability to develop appropriate standards,controls, procedures and policies for the growth and management of the joint venture and thestrength of the joint ventures relationships with its employees, suppliers and customers.Competition could have a material adverse effect on our business.          We are in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and unit volume of our salescould be negatively affected by our inability to maintain or increase prices, changes in geographicor product mix, a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption or the decision of wholesalers,retailers or consumers to purchase competitive products instead of our products. Wholesaler,retailer and consumer purchasing decisions are influenced by, among other things, the perceivedabsolute or relative overall value of our products, including their quality or pricing, compared tocompetitive products. Unit volume and dollar sales could also be affected by pricing, purchasing,financing, operational, advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers, state andprovincial agencies, and retailers which could affect their supply of, or consumer demand for, ourproducts. We could also experience higher than expected selling, general and administrativeexpenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising ormarketing expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasons.12Table of ContentsAn increase in import and excise duties or other taxes or government regulations could have amaterial adverse effect on our business.          The U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia and other countries in which we operate impose importand excise duties and other taxes on beverage alcohol products in varying amounts which have beensubject to change. Significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on beveragealcohol products could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results ofoperations. Many U.S. states have considered proposals to increase, and some of these states haveincreased, state alcohol excise taxes. There may be further consideration by governmental entitiesto increase taxes upon beverage alcohol products as governmental entities explore availablealternatives for raising funds during the current macroeconomic climate. In addition, federal,state, local and foreign governmental agencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol productsindustry concerning such matters as licensing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and requiredlabeling, advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers. Certain federal and state orprovincial regulations also require warning labels and signage. New or revised regulations orincreased licensing fees, requirements or taxes could also have a material adverse effect on ourfinancial condition or results of operations.We rely on the performance of wholesale distributors, major retailers and government agencies forthe success of our business.          Local market structures and distribution channels vary worldwide. In the U.S., we sell ourproducts principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets including grocery stores, club anddiscount stores, package liquor stores and restaurants and also directly to government agencies.In the U.K., we sell our products principally to retailers and also to wholesalers. In Australia,we sell our products principally to wholesalers and also directly to retailers, while in Canada, wesell our products principally to government agencies. The replacement or poor performance of our majorwholesalers, retailers or government agencies could materially and adversely affect our results ofoperations and financial condition. Our inability to collect accounts receivable from our majorwholesalers, retailers or government agencies could also materially and adversely affect ourresults of operations and financial condition.          The industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the wholesale and retaildistribution channels, particularly in Europe and the U.S. If we are unable to successfully adaptto this changing environment, our net income, market share and volume growth could be negativelyaffected. In addition, wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which competedirectly with our products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases. Accordingly, wholesalersor retailers may give higher priority to products of our competitors. In the future, ourwholesalers and retailers may not continue to purchase our products or provide our products withadequate levels of promotional support.13Table of ContentsOur business could be adversely affected by a decline in the consumption of products we sell.          Since 1995, there have been modest increases in consumption of beverage alcohol in most of ourproduct categories and geographic markets. There have been periods in the past, however, in whichthere were substantial declines in the overall per capita consumption of beverage alcohol productsin the U.S. and other markets in which we participate. A limited or general decline in consumptionin one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors,including:  A general decline in economic or geo-political conditions;  Increased concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcoholproducts and about drinking and driving;  A general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in on-premiseestablishments, such as may result from smoking bans;  A trend toward a healthier diet including lighter, lower calorie beverages such asdiet soft drinks, sports drinks and water products;  The increased activity of anti-alcohol groups;  Increased federal, state or foreign excise or other taxes on beverage alcoholproducts; and  Increased regulation placing restrictions on the purchase or consumption of beveragealcohol products.          In addition, our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products.The launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain especially with regard totheir appeal to consumers. The launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and anunsuccessful launch, among other things, can affect consumer perception of existing brands.We generally purchase raw materials under short-term supply contracts, and we are subject tosubstantial price fluctuations for grapes and grape-related materials, and we have a limited groupof suppliers of glass bottles.          Our business is heavily dependent upon raw materials, such as grapes, grape juice concentrate,grains, alcohol and packaging materials from third-party suppliers. We could experience rawmaterial supply, production or shipment difficulties that could adversely affect our ability tosupply goods to our customers. Increases in the costs of raw materials also directly affect us.In the past, we have experienced dramatic increases in the cost of grapes. Although we believe wehave adequate sources of grape supplies, in the event demand for certain wine products exceedsexpectations, we could experience shortages.          The wine industry swings between cycles of grape oversupply and undersupply. In a severeoversupply environment, the ability of wine producers, including ourselves, to raise prices islimited, and, in certain situations, the competitive environment may put pressure on producers tolower prices. Further, although an oversupply may enhance opportunities to purchase grapes atlower costs, a producers selling and promotional expenses associated with the sale of its wineproducts can rise in such an environment.          Glass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold. In the U.S.,Canada and Australia, glass bottles have only a small number of producers. Currently, one producersupplies most of our glass container requirements for our U.S. operations and another producersupplies substantially all of our glass container requirements for our Australian operations andone of its affiliates supplies a majority of our glass container requirements for our Canadianoperations. The inability of any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements couldadversely affect our business.14Table of ContentsOur operations subject us to risks relating to currency rate fluctuations, interest ratefluctuations and geopolitical uncertainty which could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness.          We have operations in different countries throughout the world and, therefore, are subject torisks associated with currency fluctuations. As a result of our international acquisitions, wehave significant exposure to foreign currency risk as a result of having international operationsin Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K. We are also exposed to risks associated withinterest rate fluctuations. We manage our exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risksutilizing derivative instruments and other means to reduce those risks. We, however, couldexperience changes in our ability to hedge against or manage fluctuations in foreign currencyexchange rates or interest rates and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will besuccessful in reducing those risks. We could also be affected by nationalizations or unstablegovernments or legal systems or intergovernmental disputes. These currency, economic and politicaluncertainties may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, especially to theextent these matters, or the decisions, policies or economic strength of our suppliers, affect ourglobal operations.We have a material amount of intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarks, and if we arerequired to write-down any of these intangible assets, it would reduce our net income, which inturn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.          During the years ended February 28, 2010, February 28, 2009, and February 29, 2008, werecorded impairment losses of $103.2 million, $300.4 million and $812.2 million, respectively, onour intangible assets and goodwill. We continue to have a significant amount of intangible assets,such as goodwill and trademarks. In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board(FASB) guidance for intangibles  goodwill and other, goodwill and indefinite lived intangibleassets are subject to a periodic impairment evaluation. Reductions in our net income caused by thewrite-down of any of these intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results ofoperations.The termination of our joint venture with Modelo relating to importing, marketing and sellingimported beer could have a material adverse effect on our business.          On January 2, 2007, we participated in establishing and commencing operations of a jointventure with Modelo, pursuant to which Corona Extra and the other Modelo Brands are imported,marketed and sold by the joint venture in the U.S. (including the District of Columbia) and Guamalong with certain other imported beer brands in their respective territories. Pursuant to thejoint venture and related importation arrangements, the joint venture will continue for an initialterm of 10 years, and renew in 10-year periods unless GModelo Corporation, a Delaware corporationand subsidiary of Diblo, gives notice prior to the end of year seven of any term of its intentionto purchase our interest we hold through our subsidiary, Constellation Beers Ltd. (ConstellationBeers). The joint venture may also terminate under other circumstances involving action bygovernmental authorities, certain changes in control of us or Constellation Beers as well as inconnection with certain breaches of the importation and related sub-license agreements, afternotice and cure periods.          The termination of the joint venture by acquisition of Constellation Beers interest or forother reasons noted above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditionor results of operations.15Table of ContentsClass action or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse or the misuse of alcohol could adverselyaffect our business.          There has been increased public attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry, which webelieve is due to concern over problems related to alcohol abuse, including drinking and driving,underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol. Adverse developments inlawsuits concerning these types of matters or a significant decline in the social acceptability of beverage alcoholproducts that results from lawsuits could have a material adverseeffect on our business.We depend upon our trademarks and proprietary rights, and any failure to protect our intellectualproperty rights or any claims that we are infringing upon the rights of others may adversely affectour competitive position and brand equity.          Our future success depends significantly on our ability to protect our current and futurebrands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights. We have been granted numeroustrademark registrations covering our brands and products and have filed, and expect to continue tofile, trademark applications seeking to protect newly-developed brands and products. We cannot besure that trademark registrations will be issued with respect to any of our trademark applications.There is also a risk that we could, by omission, fail to timely renew or protect a trademark orthat our competitors will challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarksissued to, or licensed by, us.Contamination could harm the integrity or customer support for our brands and adversely affect thesales of our products.          The success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of those brands.Contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or otherevents that harm the integrity or consumer support for those brands, could adversely affect theirsales. Contaminants in raw materials purchased from third parties and used in the production ofour wine and spirits products or defects in the distillation or fermentation process could lead tolow beverage quality as well as illness among, or injury to, consumers of our products and mayresult in reduced sales of the affected brand or all of our brands.An increase in the cost of energy or the cost of environmental regulatory compliance could affectour profitability.          We have experienced significant increases in energy costs, and energy costs could continue torise, which would result in higher transportation, freight and other operating costs. We mayexperience significant future increases in the costs associated with environmental regulatorycompliance. Our future operating expenses and margins will be dependent on our ability to managethe impact of cost increases. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to pass along increasedenergy costs or increased costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance to ourcustomers through increased prices.16Table of ContentsOur reliance upon complex information systems distributed worldwide and our reliance upon thirdparty global networks means we could experience interruptions to our business services.          We depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface withcustomers, as well as maintain financial accuracy and efficiency. If we do not allocate, andeffectively manage, the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technologyinfrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss ofcustomers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through securitybreach. As with all large systems, our information systems could be penetrated by outside partiesintent on extracting information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes. Suchunauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets.Changes in accounting guidance and taxation requirements could affect our financial results.          New accounting guidance that may become applicable to us from time to time, or changes in theinterpretations of existing guidance, could have a significant effect on our reported results forthe affected periods. In addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/orsales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in indirect taxescould affect our products affordability and therefore reduce our sales. We are also subject toincome tax in numerous jurisdictions in which we generate revenues. Changes in tax laws, tax ratesor tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Our taxliabilities are affected by the mix of pretax income or loss among the tax jurisdictions in whichwe operate. We must exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes,interest and penalties; accordingly, future events could change managements assessment of theseamounts.Various diseases, pests and certain weather conditions could affect quality and quantity of grapesor other agricultural raw materials.          Various diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, drought, frosts and certain other weather conditionscould affect the quality and quantity of grapes and other agricultural raw materials available,decreasing the supply of our products and negatively impacting profitability. We cannot guaranteethat our grape suppliers or suppliers of other agricultural raw materials will succeed inpreventing contamination in existing vineyards or fields or that we will succeed in preventingcontamination in our existing vineyards or future vineyards we may acquire. Future governmentrestrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in grape growing may increase vineyardcosts and/or reduce production. Growing agricultural raw materials also requires adequate watersupplies. A substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape cropsand vines or other crops, which could lead to a shortage of our product supply"
2,STZ,CONSTELLATION BRANDS,2009-04-29,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
     In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully considerthe following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results ofoperations. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional factors notpresently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adverselyaffect our business operations.Recent worldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions could adverselyimpact our financial performance.     As widely reported, the worldwide and domestic economies have experienced adverse conditionsand may be subject to further deterioration for the foreseeable future. We are subject to risksassociated with these adverse conditions, including economic slowdown and the disruption,volatility and tightening of credit and capital markets.     In addition, this global economic situation could adversely impact our major suppliers,distributors and retailers. The inability of suppliers, distributors or retailers to conductbusiness or to access liquidity could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products.We have a committed credit facility and additional liquidity facilities available to us. While todate we have not experienced problems with accessing these facilities, to the extent that thefinancial institutions that participate in these facilities were to default on their obligation tofund, those funds would not be available to us.     The timing and nature of any recovery in the financial markets remains uncertain, and therecan be no assurance that market conditions will improve in the near future. A prolonged downturn,further worsening or broadening of the adverse conditions in the worldwide and domestic economiescould affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our products, and create or exacerbatecredit issues, cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and for our suppliers,distributors, retailers and consumers. Depending upon their severity and duration, theseconditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition andresults of operations. The Company is unable to predict the likely duration and severity of thecurrent disruption in the financial markets and the adverse economic conditions in the UnitedStates and its other major markets outside the United States.12Table of ContentsOur indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our financial health.     We have incurred substantial indebtedness to finance our acquisitions. In the future, we mayincur substantial additional indebtedness to finance further acquisitions or for other purposes.Our ability to satisfy our debt obligations outstanding from time to time will depend upon ourfuture operating performance. We do not have complete control over our future operatingperformance because it is subject to prevailing economic conditions, levels of interest rates andfinancial, business and other factors. We cannot assure you that our business will generatesufficient cash flow from operations to meet all of our debt service requirements and to fund ourcapital expenditure requirements.     Our current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have importantconsequences to you. These consequences include, or may include, the following:  Our ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or acquisitions orother purposes may be limited;   Our funds available for operations, expansion or distributions will be reducedbecause we will dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to thepayment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;   Our ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants; and   Our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than less leveragedcompetitors and, thus, our ability to withstand competitive pressures may be limited.     Our senior credit facility and the indentures under which our debt securities have been issuedcontain restrictive covenants and provisions. These covenants and provisions affect our ability togrant additional liens, engage in changes of control and engage in certain other fundamentalchanges. Certain of our existing indentures under which debt securities have been issued containadditional covenants and provisions that affect our ability to incur additional debt, sell assets,pay dividends, enter into transactions with affiliates, make investments and engage in certainother additional fundamental changes. Our senior credit facility also contains restrictions on ourability to make acquisitions and certain financial ratio tests, including a debt coverage ratio andan interest coverage ratio. These restrictions could limit our ability to conduct business. If wefail to comply with the obligations contained in the senior credit facility, our existing or futureindentures or other loan agreements, we could be in default under such agreements, which couldrequire us to immediately repay the related debt and also debt under other agreements that maycontain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.13Table of ContentsOur acquisition, disposition and joint venture strategies may not be successful.     We have made a number of acquisitions, including our acquisition of the Fortune Brands, Inc.U.S. wine business, our Svedka acquisition and our Vincor acquisition and we anticipate that wemay, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies that webelieve would provide a strategic fit with our business. We will need to integrate acquiredbusinesses with our existing operations. We cannot assure you that we will effectively assimilatethe business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or product offerings orrealize anticipated operational synergies. Integrating the operations and personnel of acquiredcompanies into our existing operations or separating from our existing operations the operationsand personnel of businesses of which we dispose may result in difficulties, significant expense andaccounting charges, disrupt our business or divert managements time and attention. In connectionwith the integration of acquired operations or the conduct of our overall business strategies, wemay periodically restructure our businesses and/or sell assets or portions of our business,including the recent sale of our value spirits business. We may not achieve expected cost savingsfrom restructuring activities or realize the expected proceeds from sales of assets or portions ofour business, and actual charges, costs and adjustments due to restructuring activities may varymaterially from our estimates. Additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the fairvalue of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially fromearlier estimates. We cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses will remainconstant.     Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to unknown liabilitiesof acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquiredbusiness. In connection with acquisitions or joint venture investments outside the U.S., we mayenter into derivative contracts to purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against the risk offoreign currency fluctuations in connection with such acquisitions or joint venture investments,which subjects us to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations associated with such derivativecontracts.     We have entered into joint ventures, including our joint venture with Modelo and our jointventure with Punch, and we may enter into additional joint ventures. We share control of our jointventures. Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests orgoals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint venture. Our joint venturearrangements may require us to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments and we mayhave little control over the amount or the timing of these payments and investments. In addition,our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may berequired to fulfill those obligations alone. Our failure or the failure of an entity in which wehave a joint venture interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions orjoint ventures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results ofoperations. We cannot assure you that any of our acquisitions or joint ventures will be profitableor that forecasts regarding joint venture activities will be accurate. In particular, risks anduncertainties associated with our joint ventures include, among others, the joint ventures abilityto operate its business successfully, the joint ventures ability to develop appropriate standards,controls, procedures and policies for the growth and management of the joint venture and thestrength of the joint ventures relationships with its employees, suppliers and customers.14Table of ContentsCompetition could have a material adverse effect on our business.     We are in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and unit volume of our salescould be negatively affected by our inability to maintain or increase prices, changes in geographicor product mix, a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption or the decision of wholesalers,retailers or consumers to purchase competitive products instead of our products. Wholesaler,retailer and consumer purchasing decisions are influenced by, among other things, the perceivedabsolute or relative overall value of our products, including their quality or pricing, compared tocompetitive products. Unit volume and dollar sales could also be affected by pricing, purchasing,financing, operational, advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers, state andprovincial agencies, and retailers which could affect their supply of, or consumer demand for, ourproducts. We could also experience higher than expected selling, general and administrativeexpenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising orpromotional expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasons.An increase in import and excise duties or other taxes or government regulations could have amaterial adverse effect on our business.     The U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia and other countries in which we operate impose importand excise duties and other taxes on beverage alcohol products in varying amounts which have beensubject to change. Significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on beveragealcohol products could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results ofoperations. Many U.S. states have considered proposals to increase, and some of these states haveincreased, state alcohol excise taxes. There may be further consideration by governmental entitiesto increase taxes upon beverage alcohol products as governmental entities explore availablealternatives for raising funds during the current macroeconomic climate. In addition, federal,state, local and foreign governmental agencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol productsindustry concerning such matters as licensing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and requiredlabeling, advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers. Certain federal and state orprovincial regulations also require warning labels and signage. New or revised regulations orincreased licensing fees, requirements or taxes could also have a material adverse effect on ourfinancial condition or results of operations.We rely on the performance of wholesale distributors, major retailers and government agencies for thesuccess of our business.     Local market structures and distribution channels vary worldwide. In the U.S., we sell our products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outletsincluding grocery stores, club and discount stores, package liquor stores and restaurants and also directly to government agencies. In theU.K., we sell our products principally to retailers and also to wholesalers.In Australia, we sell our products principally to wholesalers andalso directly to retailers, while in Canada, we sell our products to government agencies. The replacement or poor performance of our major wholesalers,retailers or government agencies could materially and adversely affect our results of operationsand financial condition. Our inability to collect accounts receivable from our major wholesalers,retailers or government agencies could also materially and adversely affect our results ofoperations and financial condition.     The industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the wholesale and retaildistribution channels, particularly in Europe and the U.S. If we are unable to successfully adaptto this changing environment, our net income, market share and volume growth could be negativelyaffected. In addition, wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which competedirectly with our products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases. Accordingly, wholesalersor retailers may give higher priority to products of our competitors. In the future, ourwholesalers and retailers may not continue to purchase our products or provide our products withadequate levels of promotional support.15Table of ContentsOur business could be adversely affected by a decline in the consumption of products we sell.     Since 1995, there have been modest increases in consumption of beverage alcohol in most of ourproduct categories and geographic markets. There have been periods in the past, however, in whichthere were substantial declines in the overall per capita consumption of beverage alcohol productsin the U.S. and other markets in which we participate. A limited or general decline in consumptionin one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors,including:  A general decline in economic or geo-political conditions;   Increased concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcoholproducts and about drinking and driving;   A general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in on-premiseestablishments, such as may result from smoking bans;   A trend toward a healthier diet including lighter, lower calorie beverages such asdiet soft drinks, juices and water products;   The increased activity of anti-alcohol groups;   Increased federal, state or foreign excise or other taxes on beverage alcoholproducts; and   Increased regulation placing restrictions on the purchase or consumption of beveragealcohol products.     In addition, our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products.The launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain especially with regard totheir appeal to consumers. The launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and anunsuccessful launch, among other things, can affect consumer perception of existing brands.We generally purchase raw materials under short-term supply contracts, and we are subject tosubstantial price fluctuations for grapes and grape-related materials, and we have a limited groupof suppliers of glass bottles.     Our business is heavily dependent upon raw materials, such as grapes, grape juice concentrate,grains, alcohol and packaging materials from third-party suppliers. We could experience rawmaterial supply, production or shipment difficulties that could adversely affect our ability tosupply goods to our customers. Increases in the costs of raw materials also directly affect us.In the past, we have experienced dramatic increases in the cost of grapes. Although we believe wehave adequate sources of grape supplies, in the event demand for certain wine products exceedexpectations, we could experience shortages.     The wine industry swings between cycles of grape oversupply and undersupply. In a severeoversupply environment, the ability of wine producers, including ourselves, to raise prices islimited, and, in certain situations, the competitive environment may put pressure on producers tolower prices. Further, although an oversupply may enhance opportunities to purchase grapes atlower costs, a producers selling and promotional expenses associated with the sale of its wineproducts can rise in such an environment.     Glass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold. In the U.S.,Canada and Australia, glass bottles have only a small number of producers. Currently, one producersupplies most of our glass container requirements for our U.S. operations and another producersupplies substantially all of our glass container requirements for our Australian operations andone of its affiliates supplies a majority of our glass container requirements for our Canadianoperations. The inability of any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements couldadversely affect our business.16Table of ContentsOur operations subject us to risks relating to currency rate fluctuations, interest ratefluctuations and geopolitical uncertainty which could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness.     We have operations in different countries throughout the world and, therefore, are subject torisks associated with currency fluctuations. As a result of our international acquisitions, wehave significant exposure to foreign currency risk as a result of having international operationsin Australia, New Zealand and the U.K. Following the Vincor acquisition, our exposure to foreigncurrency risk increased significantly in Canada and also further increased in Australia, NewZealand and the U.K. We are also exposed to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. Wemanage our exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risks utilizing derivative instrumentsand other means to reduce those risks. We, however, could experience changes in our ability tohedge against or manage fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates and,accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reducing those risks. Wecould also be affected by nationalizations or unstable governments or legal systems orintergovernmental disputes. These currency, economic and political uncertainties may have amaterial adverse effect on our results of operations, especially to the extent these matters, orthe decisions, policies or economic strength of our suppliers, affect our global operations.We have a material amount of intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarks, and if we arerequired to write-down any of these intangible assets, it would reduce our net income, which inturn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.     During the years ended February 28, 2009, and February 29, 2008, we recorded impairment lossesof $300.4 million and $812.2 million, respectively, on our goodwill and intangible assets. Wecontinue to have a significant amount of intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarks. Inaccordance with the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Statement of FinancialAccounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill andindefinite lived intangible assets are subject to a periodic impairment evaluation. Reductions inour net income caused by the write-down of any of these intangible assets could materially andadversely affect our results of operations.The termination of our joint venture with Modelo relating to importing, marketing and sellingimported beer could have a material adverse effect on our business.     On January 2, 2007, we participated in establishing and commencing operations of a jointventure with Modelo, pursuant to which Corona Extra and the other Modelo Brands are imported,marketed and sold by the joint venture in the U.S. (including the District of Columbia) and Guamalong with certain other imported beer brands in their respective territories. Pursuant to thejoint venture and related importation arrangements, the joint venture will continue for an initialterm of 10 years, and renew in 10-year periods unless GModelo Corporation, a Delaware corporationand subsidiary of Diblo, gives notice prior to the end of year seven of any term of its intentionto purchase our interest we hold through our subsidiary, Constellation Beers Ltd. (ConstellationBeers). The joint venture may also terminate under other circumstances involving action bygovernmental authorities, certain changes in control of us or Constellation Beers as well as inconnection with certain breaches of the importation and related sub-license agreements, afternotice and cure periods.     The termination of the joint venture by acquisition of Constellation Beers interest or forother reasons noted above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditionor results of operations.17Table of ContentsClass action or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse or the misuse of alcohol could adverselyaffect our business.     There has been increased public attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry, which webelieve is due to concern over problems related to alcohol abuse, including drinking and driving,underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol. Several beverage alcoholproducers have been sued in several courts regarding alleged advertising practices relating tounderage consumers. Adverse developments in these types of lawsuits or a significant decline inthe social acceptability of beverage alcohol products that results from lawsuits could materiallyadversely affect our business.We depend upon our trademarks and proprietary rights, and any failure to protect our intellectualproperty rights or any claims that we are infringing upon the rights of others may adversely affectour competitive position and brand equity.     Our future success depends significantly on our ability to protect our current and futurebrands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights. We have been granted numeroustrademark registrations covering our brands and products and have filed, and expect to continue tofile, trademark applications seeking to protect newly-developed brands and products. We cannot besure that trademark registrations will be issued with respect to any of our trademark applications.There is also a risk that we could, by omission, fail to timely renew or protect a trademark orthat our competitors will challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarksissued to, or licensed by, us.Contamination could harm the integrity or customer support for our brands and adversely affect thesales of our products.     The success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of those brands.Contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or otherevents that harm the integrity or consumer support for those brands, could adversely affect theirsales. Contaminants in raw materials purchased from third parties and used in the production ofour wine and spirits products or defects in the distillation or fermentation process could lead tolow beverage quality as well as illness among, or injury to, consumers of our products and mayresult in reduced sales of the affected brand or all of our brands.An increase in the cost of energy or the cost of environmental regulatory compliance could affectour profitability.     We have experienced significant increases in energy costs, and energy costs could continue torise, which would result in higher transportation, freight and other operating costs. We mayexperience significant future increases in the costs associated with environmental regulatorycompliance. Our future operating expenses and margins will be dependent on our ability to managethe impact of cost increases. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to pass along increasedenergy costs or increased costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance to ourcustomers through increased prices.18Table of ContentsOur reliance upon complex information systems distributed worldwide and our reliance upon thirdparty global networks means we could experience interruptions to our business services.     We depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface withcustomers, as well as maintain financial accuracy and efficiency. If we do not allocate, andeffectively manage, the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technologyinfrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss ofcustomers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through securitybreach. As with all large systems, our information systems could be penetrated by outside partiesintent on extracting information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes. Suchunauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets.Changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements could affect our financial results.     New accounting standards or pronouncements that may become applicable to us from time to time,or changes in the interpretation of existing standards and pronouncements, could have a significanteffect on our reported results for the affected periods. We are also subject to income tax in thenumerous jurisdictions in which we generate revenues. In addition, our products are subject toimport and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions in which weoperate. Increases in income tax rates could reduce our after-tax income from affectedjurisdictions, while increases in indirect taxes could affect our products affordability andtherefore reduce our sales.Various diseases, pests and certain weather conditions could affect quality and quantity of grapesor other agricultural raw materials.     Various diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, drought, frosts and certain other weather conditionscould affect the quality and quantity of grapes and other agricultural raw materials available,decreasing the supply of our products and negatively impacting profitability. We cannot guaranteethat our grape suppliers or suppliers of other agricultural raw materials will succeed inpreventing contamination in existing vineyards or fields or that we will succeed in preventingcontamination in our existing vineyards or future vineyards we may acquire. Future governmentrestrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in grape growing may increase vineyardcosts and/or reduce production. Growing agricultural raw materials also requires adequate watersupplies. A substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape cropsand vines or other crops, which could lead to a shortage of our product supply"
0,STZ,CONSTELLATION BRANDS,2008-04-29,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
     In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully considerthe following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results ofoperations. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional factors notpresently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adverselyaffect our business operations.Our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our financial health.     We have incurred substantial indebtedness to finance our acquisitions. In the future, we mayincur substantial additional indebtedness to finance further acquisitions or for other purposes.Our ability to satisfy our debt obligations outstanding from time to time will depend upon ourfuture operating performance. We do not have complete control over our future operatingperformance because it is subject to prevailing economic conditions, levels of interest rates andfinancial, business and other factors. We cannot assure you that our business will generatesufficient cash flow from operations to meet all of our debt service requirements and to fund ourcapital expenditure requirements.     Our current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have importantconsequences to you. These consequences include, or may include, the following:  Our ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or acquisitions orother purposes may be limited;   Our funds available for operations, expansion or distributions will be reducedbecause we will dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to thepayment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;   Our ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants; and   Our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than less leveragedcompetitors and, thus, our ability to withstand competitive pressures may be limited.11Table of Contents     Our senior credit facility and the indentures under which our debt securities have been issuedcontain restrictive covenants and provisions. These covenants and provisions affect our ability togrant additional liens, engage in changes of control and engage in certain other fundamentalchanges. Certain of our existing indentures under which debt securities have been issued containadditional covenants and provisions that affect our ability to incur additional debt, sell assets,pay dividends, enter into transactions with affiliates, make investments and engage in certainother additional fundamental changes. Our senior credit facility also contains restrictions on ourability to make acquisitions and certain financial ratio tests, including a debt coverage ratio andan interest coverage ratio. These restrictions could limit our ability to conduct business. If wefail to comply with the obligations contained in the senior credit facility, our existing or futureindentures or other loan agreements, we could be in default under such agreements, which couldrequire us to immediately repay the related debt and also debt under other agreements that maycontain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.Our acquisition and joint venture strategies may not be successful.     We have made a number of acquisitions, including our recent acquisition of the Fortune Brands,Inc. U.S. wine business, our Svedka acquisition and our Vincor acquisition and we anticipate thatwe may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies that webelieve would provide a strategic fit with our business. We will need to integrate acquiredbusinesses with our existing operations. We cannot assure you that we will effectively assimilatethe business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or product offerings orrealize anticipated operational synergies. Integrating the operations and personnel of acquiredcompanies into our existing operations may result in difficulties, significant expense andaccounting charges, disrupt our business or divert managements time and attention. In connectionwith the integration of acquired operations, we may periodically restructure our businesses and/orsell assets. We may not achieve expected cost savings from restructuring activities or realize theexpected proceeds from asset sales, and actual charges, costs and adjustments due to restructuringactivities may vary materially from our estimates. Additionally, our final determinations andappraisals of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions mayvary materially from earlier estimates. We cannot assure you that the fair value of acquiredbusinesses will remain constant.     Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to unknown liabilitiesof acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquiredbusiness. In connection with acquisitions or joint venture investments outside the U.S., we mayenter into derivative contracts to purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against the risk offoreign currency fluctuations in connection with such acquisitions or joint venture investments,which subjects us to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations associated with such derivativecontracts.12Table of Contents     We have entered into joint ventures, including our joint venture with Modelo and our jointventure with Punch, and we may enter into additional joint ventures. We share control of our jointventures. Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests orgoals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint venture. Our joint venturearrangements may require us to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments and we mayhave little control over the amount or the timing of these payments and investments. In addition,our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may berequired to fulfill those obligations alone. Our failure or the failure of an entity in which wehave a joint venture interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions orjoint ventures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results ofoperations. We cannot assure you that any of our acquisitions or joint ventures will be profitableor that forecasts regarding joint venture activities will be accurate. In particular, risks anduncertainties associated with our joint ventures include, among others, the joint ventures abilityto operate its business successfully, the joint ventures ability to develop appropriate standards,controls, procedures and policies for the growth and management of the joint venture and thestrength of the joint ventures relationships with its employees, suppliers and customers.Competition could have a material adverse effect on our business.     We are in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and unit volume of our salescould be negatively affected by our inability to maintain or increase prices, changes in geographicor product mix, a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption or the decision of wholesalers,retailers or consumers to purchase competitive products instead of our products. Wholesaler,retailer and consumer purchasing decisions are influenced by, among other things, the perceivedabsolute or relative overall value of our products, including their quality or pricing, compared tocompetitive products. Unit volume and dollar sales could also be affected by pricing, purchasing,financing, operational, advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers, state andprovincial agencies, and retailers which could affect their supply of, or consumer demand for, ourproducts. We could also experience higher than expected selling, general and administrativeexpenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising orpromotional expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasons.An increase in import and excise duties or other taxes or government regulations could have amaterial adverse effect on our business.     The U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia and other countries in which we operate impose importand excise duties and other taxes on beverage alcohol products in varying amounts which have beensubject to change. Significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on beveragealcohol products could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results ofoperations. Many U.S. states have considered proposals to increase, and some of these states haveincreased, state alcohol excise taxes. In addition, federal, state, local and foreign governmentalagencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol products industry concerning such matters aslicensing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and required labeling, advertising and relationswith wholesalers and retailers. Certain federal and state or provincial regulations also requirewarning labels and signage. New or revised regulations or increased licensing fees, requirements ortaxes could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results ofoperations.13Table of ContentsWe rely on the performance of wholesale distributors, major retailers and chains for the success ofour business.     In the U.S., we sell our products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outletsincluding grocery stores, package liquor stores, club and discount stores and restaurants. In theU.K., Canada and Australia, we sell our products principally to wholesalers and directly to majorretailers and chains. The replacement or poor performance of our major wholesalers, retailers orchains could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our inability to collect accounts receivable from our major wholesalers, retailers or chains couldalso materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.     The industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the wholesale and retaildistribution channels, particularly in Europe and the U.S. If we are unable to successfully adaptto this changing environment, our net income, share of sales and volume growth could be negativelyaffected. In addition, wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which competedirectly with our products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases. Accordingly, wholesalersor retailers may give higher priority to products of our competitors. In the future, ourwholesalers and retailers may not continue to purchase our products or provide our products withadequate levels of promotional support.Our business could be adversely affected by a decline in the consumption of products we sell.     Since 1995, there have been modest increases in consumption of beverage alcohol in most of ourproduct categories and geographic markets. There have been periods in the past, however, in whichthere were substantial declines in the overall per capita consumption of beverage alcohol productsin the U.S. and other markets in which we participate. A limited or general decline in consumptionin one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors,including:  A general decline in economic or geo-political conditions;   Increased concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcoholproducts and about drinking and driving;   A general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in on-premiseestablishments, such as may result from smoking bans;   A trend toward a healthier diet including lighter, lower calorie beverages such asdiet soft drinks, juices and water products;   The increased activity of anti-alcohol groups;   Increased federal, state or foreign excise or other taxes on beverage alcoholproducts; and   Increased regulation placing restrictions on the purchase or consumption of beveragealcohol products.     In addition, our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products.The launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain especially with regard totheir appeal to consumers. The launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and anunsuccessful launch, among other things, can affect consumer perception of existing brands.14Table of ContentsWe generally purchase raw materials under short-term supply contracts, and we are subject tosubstantial price fluctuations for grapes and grape-related materials, and we have a limited groupof suppliers of glass bottles.     Our business is heavily dependent upon raw materials, such as grapes, grape juice concentrate,grains, alcohol and packaging materials from third-party suppliers. We could experience rawmaterial supply, production or shipment difficulties that could adversely affect our ability tosupply goods to our customers. Increases in the costs of raw materials also directly affect us.In the past, we have experienced dramatic increases in the cost of grapes. Although we believe wehave adequate sources of grape supplies, in the event demand for certain wine products exceedexpectations, we could experience shortages.     The wine industry swings between cycles of grape oversupply and undersupply. In a severeoversupply environment, the ability of wine producers, including ourselves, to raise prices islimited, and, in certain situations, the competitive environment may put pressure on producers tolower prices. Further, although an oversupply may enhance opportunities to purchase grapes atlower costs, a producers selling and promotional expenses associated with the sale of its wineproducts can rise in such an environment.     Glass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold. In the U.S.,Canada and Australia, glass bottles have only a small number of producers. Currently, one producersupplies most of our glass container requirements for our U.S. operations and another producersupplies substantially all of our glass container requirements for our Australian operations andone of its affiliates supplies a majority of our glass container requirements for our Canadianoperations. The inability of any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements couldadversely affect our business.Our operations subject us to risks relating to currency rate fluctuations, interest ratefluctuations and geopolitical uncertainty which could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness.     We have operations in different countries throughout the world and, therefore, are subject torisks associated with currency fluctuations. As a result of our international acquisitions, wehave significant exposure to foreign currency risk as a result of having international operationsin Australia, New Zealand and the U.K. Following the Vincor acquisition, our exposure to foreigncurrency risk increased significantly in Canada and also further increased in Australia, NewZealand and the U.K. We are also exposed to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. Wemanage our exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risks utilizing derivative instrumentsand other means to reduce those risks. We, however, could experience changes in our ability tohedge against or manage fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates and,accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reducing those risks. Wecould also be affected by nationalizations or unstable governments or legal systems orintergovernmental disputes. These currency, economic and political uncertainties may have amaterial adverse effect on our results of operations, especially to the extent these matters, orthe decisions, policies or economic strength of our suppliers, affect our global operations.We have a material amount of intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarks, and if we arerequired to write-down any of these intangible assets, it would reduce our net income, which inturn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.     We have a significant amount of intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarks. Weadopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards(SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in its entirety, on March 1, 2002. UnderSFAS No. 142, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized, but insteadare subject to a periodic impairment evaluation. Reductions in our net income caused by thewrite-down of any of these intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our results ofoperations.15Table of ContentsThe termination of our joint venture with Modelo relating to importing, marketing and sellingimported beer could have a material adverse effect on our business.     On January 2, 2007, we participated in establishing and commencing operations of a jointventure with Modelo, pursuant to which Corona Extra and the other Modelo Brands are imported,marketed and sold by the joint venture in the U.S. (including the District of Columbia) and Guamalong with certain other imported beer brands in their respective territories. Pursuant to thejoint venture and related importation arrangements, the joint venture will continue for an initialterm of 10 years, and renew in 10-year periods unless GModelo Corporation, a Delaware corporationand subsidiary of Diblo, gives notice prior to the end of year seven of any term of its intentionto purchase our interest we hold through our subsidiary, Barton Beers, Ltd. (Barton). The jointventure may also terminate under other circumstances involving action by governmental authorities,certain changes in control of us or Barton as well as in connection with certain breaches of theimportation and related sub-license agreements, after notice and cure periods.     The termination of the joint venture by acquisition of Bartons interest or for other reasonsnoted above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results ofoperations.Class action or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse or the misuse of alcohol could adverselyaffect our business.     There has been increased public attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry, which webelieve is due to concern over problems related to alcohol abuse, including drinking and driving,underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol.
