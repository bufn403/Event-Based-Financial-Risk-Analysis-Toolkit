4,MSN,EMERSON RADIO CORP,2022-06-23,">Item 1A. RISK FACTORS The reader should carefully consider these risk factors in addition to those set forth in the Company’s financial statements or the notes thereto. Additional risks about which the Company is not yet aware or that the Company currently believes to be immaterial also may adversely affect the Company’s business operations. If any of the following occur, the Company’s business, financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected. In that case, the price of the Company’s common stock may decline. Business, Operational and Strategic Risks  The Company’s business has been and is expected to continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Company continues to monitor the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of its operations and regions, including the effect on its consumers, employees, trade customers, suppliers and distribution channels. The pandemic has created significant business disruption and economic uncertainty, which has affected the Company’s supply chain, distribution channels and consumer demand for its products, and has directly and indirectly affected the Company’s business and operating results. However, the full extent of its impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including the scope of any new virus mutations and outbreaks, the breadth and duration of any future business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, consumer confidence and the success of business and economic recovery as the pandemic recedes. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any other health epidemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change not only with the spread of the disease, but also with the scope and timing of governmental, regulatory, fiscal, monetary and public health responses.  Surges in demand related to COVID-19, as well as other factors, have continued to strain the global supply chain network, which has resulted in carrier-imposed capacity restrictions, carrier delays, and longer lead times. Demand for Chinese imports has caused shipment receiving and unloading backlogs at many U.S. ports that have been unable to keep pace with unprecedented inbound 8container volume. The situation has been further exacerbated by COVID-19 illness and protocols at many port locations. For example, the Company’s supply chain has been and may in the future be adversely affected with production delays, service disruptions or limited manufacturing volumes associated with shutdowns of factories, logistics providers and shippers or reduced numbers of workers or working hours in the respective facilities, limits on component supplies and diminished capability to implement engineering and design changes in a timely manner. In addition, the Company has experienced an increase in its freight costs as a result of the pandemic. Further, if the COVID-19 pandemic continues and the Company’s operations continue to be adversely affected, the Company risks a delay, default, violation and/or non-compliance under existing agreements. Many of these effects may not be covered by the Company’s existing insurance coverages. The spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, has had and may continue to have a material economic effect on the Company’s business. For example, the pandemic and related measures taken to limit the spread of disease has resulted in retail store closures, both temporary and permanent, higher unemployment and greater economic uncertainty, which have and may continue to adversely affect consumer purchasing behavior. Consumer spending generally may also be negatively affected by general macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence, including the effects of the current recession, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This may negatively affect sales of the Company’s products at retail stores and online marketplace channels and through the Company’s licensing agreements. Any significant reduction in consumer visits to, or spending at, retail stores, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and any decreased spending at retail stores or online caused by decreased consumer confidence and spending following the pandemic, may result in a loss of sales of the Company’s products and profits and other material adverse effects.   While the potential economic effects and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it has already caused, and is likely to result in further, significant disruption of global financial markets. In addition, the current recession has, and a depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business and the market value of its common stock. The Company does not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on its business, its industry or the global economy as a whole, and the Company cannot predict the effects that COVID-19 pandemic-related business disruptions and economic uncertainty will have on its customers, suppliers, consumers, and each of their financial conditions. However, any material effect on these parties could further adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, notwithstanding ongoing efforts to manage COVID-19, including increased testing, widespread vaccination of the public and treatment of those who have contracted COVID-19, it is unclear when or whether progress in any of those areas will translate into an economic recovery that will restore consumer confidence and accelerate consumer spending. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed below in this “Risk Factors
” section, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial condition. Accordingly, given that the potential of these effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operations has been and will likely continue to be material, the Company will continue to monitor the situation closely.The Company relies on a small number of key customers for the majority of its business, and the loss or significant reduction in business with any of these key customers would materially and adversely affect the Company’s revenues and earnings. Certain customers have historically made up a significant percentage of the Company’s product sales and net revenues. For fiscal 2022, Walmart, Amazon.com and Fred Meyer accounted for approximately 45%, 32% and 13%, respectively, of the Company’s net revenues. For fiscal 2021, Walmart, Amazon.com and Fred Meyer accounted for approximately 37%, 33% and 11%, respectively, of the Company’s net revenues. The Company expects that its online marketplaces will increasingly represent a significant portion of the Company’s product sales going forward. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net revenues during these periods. All customer purchases are made through purchase orders and the Company does not have any long-term contracts with its customers. Accordingly, sales from customers that have accounted for a significant portion of the Company’s net product sales and net revenues in past periods, individually or as a group, may not continue in future periods, or if continued, may not reach or exceed historical levels in any period, which has happened in the past and could happen in the future. Some of the Company’s key customers may also experience economic difficulties or otherwise default on their obligations to the Company. The complete loss of, or significant reduction in business from, or a material adverse change in the financial condition of, any of the Company’s key customers would cause a material and adverse change in the Company’s revenues and operating results.The Company is dependent on a limited number of products for its sales. The Company derives a substantial portion of its product revenues from a limited number of products, and the Company expects these products to continue to account for a large percentage of its product revenues in the near term. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2022, the Company’s gross product sales were comprised principally of two product types within two categories — housewares products and audio products. Microwave ovens, which product type is within the housewares category, generated approximately 21% of the Company’s gross product sales. Audio products generated approximately 79% of the Company’s gross product sales during fiscal 2022. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, the Company’s gross product sales were comprised principally of the same two product types within the same two categories — housewares products and audio products. Microwave ovens, which product type is within the housewares category, generated approximately 35% of the Company’s gross product sales. 9Audio products generated approximately 63% of the Company’s gross product sales during fiscal 2021. Because the market for these product types and categories is characterized by periodic new product introductions, the Company’s future financial performance will depend, in part, on the successful and timely development and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of these product types and other products distributed by the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in marketing these product types within these categories or any other new or enhanced products. For example, certain of the Company’s key customers perform periodic line reviews to assess their product offerings, which have in the past and may in the future lead to loss of business and pricing pressures. As a result of this dependence, a significant decline in pricing of, or market acceptance of these product types and categories, either in general or specifically as marketed by the Company, would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operation. The loss or reduction of business of one or a combination of its houseware and audio product lines could materially adversely affect the Company’s revenues, financial condition and results of operations.If the Company’s third party sales representatives fail to adequately promote, market and sell the Company’s products, the Company’s revenues could significantly decrease. A significant portion of the Company’s product sales are made through third party sales representative organizations, whose members are not employees of the Company. The Company’s level of sales depends on the effectiveness of these organizations, as well as the effectiveness of its own employees. Some of these third party representatives may sell (and do sell), with the Company’s permission, competitive products of third parties as well as the Company’s products. During fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, these organizations were responsible for approximately 50% and 87%, respectively, of the Company’s net revenues. In addition, in fiscal 2022 one of these representative organizations was responsible for approximately 47% of the Company’s net revenues and in fiscal 2021 one of these representative organizations was responsible for approximately 49% and another was responsible for approximately 30% of the Company’s net revenues. If any of the Company’s third party sales representative organizations engaged by the Company, especially the Company’s largest, fails to adequately promote, market and sell its products, the Company’s revenues could be significantly decreased until a replacement organization or distributor could be retained by the Company, which has happened in the past and could happen in the future. The loss or reduction of product sales made through third party sales representative organizations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. Finding replacement organizations and distributors could be a time consuming process during which the Company’s revenues could be negatively impacted. The concentration of product sales among a limited number of retailers and the trend toward private label brands could materially reduce the Company’s revenues and profitability.With the concentration of the Company’s product sales among a limited number of retailers, the Company is dependent upon a small number of customers whose bargaining strength is growing. These retailers generally purchase a limited selection of houseware and consumer electronics products. As a result, there is significant competition for retail shelf space. In addition, certain of the Company’s key customers use their own private label brands that compete directly with some of the Company’s products. As the retailers in the houseware and consumer electronics industry become more concentrated, competition for sales to these retailers may increase, which could materially reduce the Company's revenues and profitability.The houseware and consumer electronics industry is consolidating, which could reduce the Company’s ability to successfully secure product placements at key customers and limit its ability to sustain a cost competitive position in the industry.Over the past several years, the houseware and consumer electronics industry has undergone substantial consolidation, and further consolidation is likely. As a result of this consolidation, the houseware and consumer electronics industry primarily consists of a limited number of large retailers and distributors. The Company’s ability to gain or maintain its market share or maintain or enhance its relationships with key customers may be limited as a result of actions by competitors or the retailers’ increasing use of private label brands.The failure to obtain new licensees and distribution relationships or to maintain relationships with its existing licensees and distributors could materially and adversely affect the Company’s revenues, earnings and business.The Company maintains agreements that allow licensees to use the Company’s trademarks for the manufacture and sale of specific consumer electronics and other products into defined geographic areas. These agreements typically are for a limited period of time and, upon expiration, the Company cannot assure that its agreements with its licensees will be renewed in the future or that the Company’s relationships with its licensees or distributors will be maintained on satisfactory terms or at all. Although the Company has engaged each of LMCA and GLSL as an agent to assist the Company in identifying and procuring licensing opportunities, there can be no assurance that the Company will find and secure suitable licensees or distribution relationships. If the Company is unable to maintain its relationships with its licensees and distributors on terms satisfactory to the Company, or if it fails to obtain new licensees 10or distribution relationships or the Company’s licensees fail to protect the integrity and reputation of the Company’s trademarks, the value of the Emerson brand and the Company’s licensing revenues and earnings could be materially and adversely affected. The Company depends on a limited number of suppliers for its products. If its relationships with such suppliers terminate or are otherwise impaired, the Company would likely experience increased costs, disruptions in the manufacture and shipment of its products and a material loss of net sales. Although there are multiple potential suppliers for each of the Company’s products, the Company relies and is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for its main products, all of which are located outside of the United States. The Company does not have any long-term or exclusive purchase commitments with any of its suppliers. Itoma was the Company’s largest supplier and accounted for approximately 83% and 59% of the Company’s purchases of products during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. The Company’s failure to maintain existing relationships with its suppliers or to establish new relationships on similar pricing and credit terms in the future could negatively affect the Company’s ability to obtain products in a timely manner. If the Company is unable to obtain an ample supply of product from its existing suppliers or secure alternative sources of supply, it may be unable to satisfy its customers’ orders, which could materially and adversely affect the Company’s revenues and relationships with its customers. Finding replacement suppliers could be a time consuming process during which the Company’s revenues and liquidity could be negatively impacted.The Company’s products use raw materials and components that may be subject to price fluctuations, shortages or interruptions of supply, and if the Company is unable to maintain supply sources for such raw materials and components, or if such sources fail to satisfy the Company’s supply requirements, the Company may experience a loss of sales, increased component costs and reduced profitability. Factors that are largely beyond the Company’s control, such as the cost, quality and availability of the raw materials and components needed by suppliers of the Company’s products, may affect the cost of such products, and the Company may not be able to pass those costs on to its customers. The Company’s products use raw materials and components that have been and may continue to be subject to price surges, shortages or interruptions of supply, including semiconductor chips that have been subject to an ongoing significant shortage. The cost, quality and availability of these components are essential to the successful production and sale of the Company’s products. If the Company is unable to maintain supply sources of these raw materials and components, or if such sources fail to satisfy the Company’s supply requirements, the Company may lose sales and experience increased component costs. In particular, the Company utilizes semiconductor chips in its housewares products and audio products. Because semiconductor chips have been recently subject to an ongoing significant shortage, the Company’s ability to source these important components that use semiconductor chips has been adversely affected. These supply interruptions have resulted in increased component delivery lead times, delays in product production and increased costs to obtain components with available semiconductor chips. To the extent this semiconductor chip shortage continues, the production ability of the Company’s suppliers may continue to be impacted. Although the Company is seeking alternate sources of supply of these components, it may take several months to locate alternative suppliers or require the re-tooling of products to accommodate components from different suppliers. If the Company or its suppliers are unable to obtain components from third parties in the quantities and of the quality that the Company requires, on a timely basis and at acceptable prices, the Company may not be able to deliver its products on a timely or cost-effective basis to its customers, which could cause customers to terminate their contracts with the Company, reduce the Company’s gross margins and seriously harm its business, results of operations and financial condition. If the Company is unable to deliver products in the required amounts and in a timely fashion, the Company could experience delays or reductions in shipments to its customers, which could materially and adversely affect the Company’s revenues and relationships with its customers. The Company’s ability to provide high quality customer service, process and fulfill orders, and manage inventory depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation and timely and uninterrupted performance of its suppliers. The Company can provide no assurances that it will not experience operational difficulties with its suppliers, including reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines, increases in manufacturing costs, increased lead times or production shutdowns or production slowdowns due to social distancing guidelines or issues with absenteeism related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which have and could in the future result in increased costs and decreased efficiency. If the Company is unable to obtain products from these factories in the required quantities and quality and in a timely fashion, the Company could experience delays or reductions in product shipments to its customers, which could negatively affect the Company’s ability to meet the requirements of its customers, as well as its relationships with its customers, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating results. In addition, shipping rates and surcharges are volatile and subject to market fluctuations, and any increases in shipping costs may reduce the Company’s margins and adversely affect its profitability.11All the Company’s suppliers are based in China and as a result the Company is subject to risks associated with international operations and global manufacturing and sourcing including, among others:  •currency fluctuations;  •labor disputes and union actions that can disrupt the Company’s ability to ship products to customers;  •potential political, economic and social instability;  •public health threats, including the COVID-19 pandemic, inclement weather and natural disasters;  •possible acts of terrorism;  •restrictions on transfers of funds;  •changes in import and export duties and quotas;  •changes in domestic and international customs and tariffs;  •uncertainties involving the costs to transport products;  •disruptions in the global transportation network, including port backlogs and availability of shipping containers;  •unexpected changes in regulatory environments;  •regulatory issues involved in dealing with foreign suppliers and in exporting and importing products;  •protection of intellectual property;  •difficulty in complying with a variety of foreign laws;  •difficulty in obtaining distribution and support; and  •potentially adverse tax consequences. Furthermore, any material disruption, slowdown or shutdown of the operations of the Company’s principal logistics providers and shippers, including without limitation as a result of labor disputes, public health threats (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), social unrest, inclement weather, natural disasters, possible acts of terrorism, availability of shipping containers and increased security restrictions, could cause delays in the Company’s ability to receive, process and fulfill customer orders and may cause orders to be canceled, lost or delivered late, goods to be returned or receipt of goods to be refused. These and other factors described above have and could continue to cause increases in shipping and storage costs. As a result, the Company’s relationships with its customers, revenues and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. The Company relies on a third-party logistics provider for the storage and distribution of its products in the United States and, if such third party logistics provider incurs any damage to the facilities where the Company’s products are stored or is unable to distribute its products as needed, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and business. The Company relies on a third-party logistics provider for the storage and distribution of its products. The facilities where the Company’s products are stored by such provider may also be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, power outages, communications failure or terrorism. Any material damage to the facilities where the Company’s products are stored could adversely affect its inventory and the ability of such third-party logistics provider to meet the needs of its customers. In addition, an inability to maintain the Company’s contracts with such third-party logistics provider or a delay, disruption or quality control problems in the operations of such third-party logistics provider, including as a result of damage to the facilities of such provider or a strike by such provider’s workers, could cause delays in the Company’s ability to fulfill customer orders and may cause orders to be canceled, lost or delivered late, the Company’s products to be returned or receipt of products to be refused, any of which could adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations. The Company’s contract with its third-party logistics provider is terminable upon written notice by either party for convenience without cause. If the Company is unable to maintain its contract with its third-party logistics provider, the Company would be required to retain a new third party logistics provider and the Company may be unable to retain such third party at a cost that is acceptable to the Company. If the Company’s shipping costs were to increase as a result of an increase in the fees charged by such third-party logistics provider or as a result of obtaining a new third-party logistics provider and if the Company is unable to pass on these higher costs to its customers, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and business.  12 The Company’s revenues and earnings could be materially and adversely affected if it cannot anticipate market trends, enhance existing products or achieve market acceptance of new products. The Company’s success is dependent on its ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands and trends in a timely manner, as well as expanding into new markets and sourcing new products that are profitable to the Company. In addition, to increase the Company’s penetration of current markets and gain footholds in new markets for its products, the Company must maintain its existing products and integrate them with new products. The Company may not be successful in sourcing, marketing and releasing new products that respond to technological developments or changing customer needs and preferences. The Company may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and sale of these new products. These new products may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and may not achieve any significant degree of market acceptance. If release dates of any future products or enhancements to the Company’s products are delayed, or if these products or enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance when released, the Company’s sales volume may decline and earnings could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, new products or enhancements by the Company’s competitors may cause customers to defer or forgo purchases of the Company’s products, which could also materially and adversely affect the Company’s revenues and earnings. Cash generated by operating activities represents the Company’s principal source of funding and therefore the Company depends on its ability to successfully manage its operating cash flows to fund its operations. The Company does not maintain any credit facilities (other than, from time to time, certain letters of credit) in connection with the operation of its business. The Company has relied on, and continues to rely on, its cash on hand and cash generated by operations to manage its business. Certain of the Company’s major factory suppliers, including Itoma, extend credit lines to the Company in amounts based on various factors, including the amounts of the Company’s purchases and their internal credit criteria, and in the past have reduced the maximum amount of open credit lines available to the Company. The loss of, or reduction in, credit lines from the Company’s principal suppliers could reduce the Company’s liquidity, increase its working capital needs or limit its ability to purchase products which in turn could adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, the Company may need to secure alternative means of financing or reorganize its operations to continue to maintain its current business.The Company is subject to intense competition in the industry in which it operates, which could cause material changes in the selling price of its products or losses of its market share. The housewares and consumer electronics industry is highly competitive, especially with respect to pricing and the introduction of new products and features. The Company’s products compete in the low to medium-priced sector of the housewares and consumer electronics market and compete primarily on the basis of reliability, brand recognition, quality, price, design, consumer acceptance of the Emerson® trademark and quality service and support to retailers and its customers. The Company and many of its competitors are subject to factory cost increases, and the Company expects these pressures to continue. If these pressures are not mitigated by increases in selling price or cost reductions from the Company’s suppliers or changes in product mix, or if the consumers of the Company’s products change their buying habits as a result of the Company’s actions, the Company’s revenues and profits could be substantially reduced. In addition, the Company’s expanded marketing plan includes sales through online marketplaces, including Amazon.com, and the success of this plan depends on the Company’s ability to increase its visibility and continue to distribute its products through these online marketplaces. As compared to the Company, many of its competitors have significantly greater managerial, financial, marketing, technical and other competitive resources and greater brand recognition. As a result, the Company’s competitors may be able to (i) adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements; (ii) rapidly replicate new features and innovations that we may introduce into the market; (iii) devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services; and (iv) respond more effectively to pricing pressures. Competition could increase if new companies enter the market, existing competitors expand their product mix or the Company expands into new markets. An increase in competition could result in material price reductions or loss of the Company’s market share. In addition, the industry in which the Company competes generally has low barriers to entry that allow the introduction of new products or new competitors at a fast pace. Some retailers have and may continue to introduce their own private label products, which could reduce the volume of products they buy from the Company, as well as decrease the shelf space they allocate to the Company’s products. If the Company is unable to protect the Company’s brand image and authenticity, the Company may be unable to effectively compete with these new market entrants or new products. The Company depends on the experience and expertise of its senior management team and key technical employees, and the loss of any key employee may impair its ability to operate effectively.The Company’s success depends upon the continued services of its senior management team and key technical employees. Each of the Company’s executive officers, key technical personnel and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with the 13Company at any time. The loss of any member of the Company’s senior management team might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of the Company’s business objectives and could materially harm the Company’s business and customer relationships. In addition, turnover, particularly on the senior management team, with insufficient development of leadership talent and succession plans, could diminish employee confidence and increase risks for retaining key employees.Changes in consumer spending and economic conditions may cause the Company’s operating results to fluctuate and cause its stock price to decline. The Company’s net revenue and operating results may vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter as well as in comparison to the corresponding quarter of the preceding year. Factors that may cause these variations include:  •changes in market and economic conditions;  •the discretionary nature of consumers’ demands and spending patterns;  •variations in the sales of the Company’s products to its significant customers;  •variations in manufacturing and supplier relationships;  •if the Company is unable to correctly anticipate and provide for inventory requirements, it may not have sufficient inventory to deliver its products to its customers in a timely fashion or the Company may have excess inventory that it is unable to sell;  •new product developments or introductions;  •product reviews and other media coverage;  •competition, including competitive price pressures; and  •political instability, war (including the current conflict in Ukraine), acts of terrorism, public health threats, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or other disasters. As a result of any of these factors, the Company’s operating results may fluctuate significantly, which may in turn cause its stock price to decline. Legal, Regulatory and Tax RisksThe Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that are central to the Company’s business; its failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm the Company’s business or operating results.The Company is or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to its business, including laws and regulations regarding consumer protection, advertising, electronic commerce, intellectual property, manufacturing, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, and economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions.The increasingly global nature of the Company’s business operations subjects the Company to domestic and foreign laws and regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions. The Company’s products are also subject to U.S. export controls, including the United States Department of Commerce’s Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. The Company is also subject to a variety of laws and regulations regarding information security and privacy. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, impose significant requirements on how the Company collects, processes and transfers personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes.Foreign regulations and changes in trade policies and the political, social and economic conditions in the United States and the foreign countries in which the Company operates its business could affect the Company’s revenues and earnings materially and adversely. The Company has operations in China and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sales of products manufactured by third parties located in China. In addition, third parties located in China and other countries located in the same region produce and supply many of the components and raw materials used in the Company’s products. Additionally, a significant portion of the shipping of the Company’s finished goods to the United States occurs through Hong Kong. Conducting an international business inherently 14involves a number of difficulties and risks that could materially and adversely affect the Company’s ability to generate revenues and could subject the Company to increased costs. The diplomatic tensions between the United States and China, including over China’s enactment of the Hong Kong national security law, create uncertainties for doing business in China, and the risk of additional protectionist trade policies and tariffs or other escalating retaliatory policies, such as the passage of the Hong Kong Autonomy Act in July 2020 and the concurrent U.S. executive order that ended the special economic status afforded to Hong Kong under the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, could increase the Company’s cost of doing business and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the current U.S. administration will alter the existing trade agreements between China and the U.S. or otherwise modify or impose additional tariffs on imports from China. It is possible that further tariffs may be imposed on the categories of products the Company imports to the United States, or that the Company’s business will be affected by retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response to existing or future tariffs, causing the Company to raise prices or make changes to its operations, any of which could adversely affect demand for the Company’s products or increase its costs.Among the other factors that may adversely affect the Company’s revenues and increase its costs are:  •currency fluctuations which could cause an increase in the price of the components and raw materials used in the Company’s products and a decrease in its profits;  •Chinese labor laws;  •labor shortages affecting the Company’s facilities and its suppliers’ manufacturing facilities located in China;  •the elimination or reduction of value-added tax refunds to Chinese factories that manufacture products for export;  •the rise of inflation and substantial economic growth in China;  •more stringent export restrictions in the countries in which the Company operates which could adversely affect its ability to deliver its products to its customers;  •tariffs and other trade barriers which could make it more expensive for the Company to obtain and deliver its products to its customers; •increases in shipping costs for the Company’s products or other service issues with the Company’s third-party shippers, such as global availability of shipping containers and fuel costs;  •political instability and economic downturns in these countries which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to obtain its products from its manufacturers or deliver its products to its customers in a timely fashion;  •outbreaks of public health threats, such as COVID-19, influenza and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, affecting the production capabilities of the Company’s suppliers, including as a result of quarantines or closures; •new restrictions on the sale of electronic products containing certain hazardous substances; and  •the laws of China are likely to govern many of the Company’s supplier agreements. Any of the factors described above may materially and adversely affect the Company’s revenues and/or increase its operating expenses. Tariffs or other restrictions placed on the Company’s products imported into the United States from China, or any related countermeasures taken by China, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, profitability and results of operations. The Company has operations in China and all of the Company’s products are currently manufactured by suppliers in China. Any tariffs or other trade restrictions affecting the import of these products to the United States from China or any retaliatory trade measures taken by China in response to existing or future tariffs could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations going forward. The Company’s dependency on its overseas suppliers could exacerbate these and other risks, and any tariffs on the categories of products the Company imports to the United States could negatively affect the demand for such products, increase the cost of components, delay production or affect the Company’s ability to compete against competitors who do not manufacture in China or otherwise are not subject to such tariffs.15Beginning in 2018, the United States has imposed additional duties, ranging from 10% to 25%, on a variety of goods imported from China. Effective in September 2018, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (“USTR”) imposed tariffs of 10% on approximately $200 billion worth of goods imported from China (“List 3 products”), including categories of products the Company imports from China and increased these tariffs to 25% effective in May 2019. In August 2019, the U.S. administration directed the USTR to increase tariffs on List 3 products from 25% to 30% effective October 2019, which increases were subsequently delayed indefinitely. In May 2019, the USTR proposed imposing additional tariffs of up to 25% on essentially all remaining Chinese-origin imports, including approximately $300 billion worth of goods imported from China (“List 4 products”). Tariffs of 15% were imposed on certain List 4 products effective in September 2019 (“List 4A products”), and the remainder were scheduled to be subject to these tariffs effective in December 2019 (“List 4B products”). In January 2020, the United States and China signed a Phase One Economic and Trade Agreement, pursuant to which the tariff increases on the List 4B products remained suspended and the rate of additional tariffs on the List 4A products was reduced to 7.5%, while all other tariffs remain in place. The effects on the Company of these imposed and proposed tariffs are uncertain because of the dynamic nature of governmental actions and responses, as well as possible exemptions for certain products. If the U.S. and China are able to negotiate the issues to restore a mutually advantageous and fair trading regime, the increased tariffs could be eliminated, but given the uncertainties, including as a result of the recent change in U.S. administrations and any other political changes, there can be no assurance of whether, or when, this will be accomplished. If the currently imposed and proposed tariffs covering the categories of products that the Company imports continue or are increased, and the Company is unable to obtain an exception, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.Although the Company is monitoring the trade environment and working to mitigate the effects of tariffs through pricing and sourcing strategies, including through proactive management of inventory built up in advance of the recent tariff increases, and may take additional steps, the Company cannot be certain how its customers and competitors will react to the actions taken. Additional tariffs imposed by the United States, and any related countermeasures by China, including as a result of the heightened tensions between the United States and China over Hong Kong, could increase the Company’s cost of goods and reduce its gross margins. If the Company determines to pass some or all of these new tariff burdens on to its customers as product price increases in the future, the result may be a degradation of the Company’s competitive position and a loss of customers that would adversely affect the Company’s operating performance. However, the ultimate outcome of these tariff actions is not clear at this time, and there can be no assurances that the Company’s mitigation efforts will be successful or that the imposition of any such tariffs or trade actions would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s revenue, gross margins and operating results.The Company could be exposed to product liability or other claims for which its product liability or other insurance may be inadequate. A failure of any of the products marketed by the Company may subject it to the risk of product liability claims and litigation arising from injuries allegedly caused by the improper functioning or design of its products. Although the Company currently maintains product liability insurance in amounts which the Company considers adequate, the Company cannot assure that:  •its insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities;  •adequate product liability insurance will continue to be available in the future; or  •its insurance can be maintained on acceptable terms. To the extent product liability or other litigation losses are beyond the limits or scope of the Company’s insurance coverage, the Company’s expenses could materially increase. The Company’s business could be materially and adversely affected if it cannot protect its intellectual property rights or if it infringes on the intellectual property rights of others. The Company’s ability to compete effectively depends on its ability to maintain and protect its proprietary rights. The Company owns the Emerson® and other trademarks, which are materially important to its business, as well as other trademarks, licenses and proprietary rights that are used for certain of the products that it markets and sells. The Company’s trademarks are registered throughout the world, including the United States and other countries. The laws of some foreign countries in which the Company operates may not protect the Company’s proprietary rights to the same extent as do laws in the United States. The protections afforded by the laws of such countries may not be adequate to protect the Company’s intellectual property rights. Third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate, circumvent or render unenforceable any trademarks, patents or proprietary rights owned by or licensed to the Company. In addition, in the event third-party licensees fail to protect the integrity of the Company’s trademarks, the value of these marks could be materially and adversely affected. The Company’s inability to protect its proprietary rights could materially and adversely affect the license of its trade names, trademarks and other proprietary rights to third parties as well as its ability to sell its products. Litigation has been and may in the future be necessary to enforce the Company’s intellectual 16property rights, protect the Company’s trade secrets and determine the scope and validity of such intellectual property rights. Any such litigation, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management’s attention from the operation of the Company’s business. The Company may receive notices of claims of infringement of other parties’ proprietary rights. Such actions could result in litigation and the Company could incur significant costs and diversion of resources in defending such claims. The party making such claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief. Such relief could effectively block the Company’s ability to make, use, sell, distribute or market its products and services in certain jurisdictions. The Company may also be required to seek licenses to such intellectual property. The Company cannot predict, however, whether such licenses would be available or, if available, that such licenses could be obtained on terms that are commercially reasonable and acceptable to the Company. The failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could delay or preclude the sale, manufacture or distribution of its products and could result in increased costs to the Company.An information systems interruption or breach in security, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and reputation.In the ordinary course of business, the Company electronically maintains sensitive data, including intellectual property, its proprietary business information and that of its customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information of employees, in its facilities and on its networks. In addition, the Company sells its products through online marketplaces, including Amazon.com, which rely upon third-party online payment platform service providers that maintain personal information collected from customers. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to the Company’s operations. A breach of the Company’s security systems and procedures or those of its vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of the Company’s customers’ or the Company’s employees’ intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information.  A cybersecurity breach could negatively affect the Company’s reputation. Because the techniques such as viruses and worms, phishing attacks, distributed denial-of-service attacks, ransomware, used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software or applications the Company procures from third parties or uses in its online marketplaces may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to the Company’s systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving its employees. Accordingly, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, or if such measures are implemented, and even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures, human errors may still occur. It is virtually impossible for the Company to entirely mitigate this risk. A party, whether internal or external, who is able to circumvent the Company’s security measures or those of its vendors could misappropriate information. In addition, cyber insurance may not protect against all of the costs and liabilities arising from a cyber-attack.If the Company or the online payment platforms it uses fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information, the Company may suffer significant reputational and financial losses and the Company’s results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and liquidity may be adversely affected. In addition, a system breach could result in other negative consequences, including disruption of internal operations, and may subject the Company to private litigation, government investigations, enforcement actions, and cause the Company to incur potentially significant liability, damages, or remediation costs.The Company operates its business in jurisdictions where intellectual property theft or compromise is common.Currently, a majority of the Company’s products are manufactured in China. Subject to contractual confidentiality obligations, the Company is required to share significant product design materials with third-parties necessary for the design and manufacture of our products. The Company cannot be sure that its data or intellectual property will not be compromised through cyber-intrusion, theft or other means, particularly when the data or intellectual property is held by partners in foreign jurisdictions. Should the Company’s intellectual property be compromised, it may be difficult to enforce the Company’s rights in China and other foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates.Fluctuations in the Company’s tax obligations and effective tax rate and realization of deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, may result in volatility of the Company’s operating results.The Company is subject to income taxes in various U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company records tax expense based on its estimates of future payments, which may include reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions, and valuation allowances related to certain net deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards. In addition, tax laws in certain jurisdictions may limit the ability to use net operating loss carryforwards upon a change in control. At any one time, many tax years may be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may 17affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. In addition, the Company’s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to changes in the mix and level of revenues, varying tax rates in the different jurisdictions in which the Company operates, fluctuations in the valuation allowance, timing of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards, or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations. Further, tax legislation or changes in tax rules and regulations or the interpretations thereof, including but not limited to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, may be enacted in the future which could negatively affect the Company’s current or future tax structure and effective tax rates.Corporate Governance and Stock Ownership RisksThere is a limited trading market for the Company’s common stock and the market price of the Company’s common stock is subject to volatility.The Company’s common stock, which trades on the NYSE American, has experienced, and may experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of the Company’s common stock. For example, the Company believes that recent volatility in the market price of the Company’s common stock reflects market and trading dynamics unrelated to the Company’s underlying business or macro or industry fundamentals. These fluctuations have been accompanied by reports of strong and atypical retail investor interest, including on social media and online forums. The Company may continue to incur rapid and substantial increases or decreases in its stock price that may not coincide in timing with the disclosure of news or developments by or affecting the Company. Accordingly, the market price of the Company’s common stock may fluctuate dramatically, and may decline rapidly, regardless of any developments in the Company’s business. The market price of the Company’s common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to various factors and events, including: •the ongoing impacts and developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic; •actual or anticipated variations in operating results and cash flows; •loss of a key customer, licensee or supplier; •announcements or events that affect the Company’s products, customers, competitors or markets; •general business conditions in the markets and industry in which the Company competes; •changes in market valuations of similar companies; •the increase in the number of individual holders of the Company’s common stock and their participation in social media platforms targeted at speculative investing;  •the level of the Company’s stock repurchase activity;  •concentration of holdings of the Company’s common stock; and •other events or factors, including those listed under this section entitled “Risk Factors
.”In addition, the securities markets have recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies due to, among other factors, the actions of market participants or other actions outside of the Company’s control, including general market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, regulatory and market conditions, may negatively impact the market price of the Company’s common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. The Company may be the target of this type of litigation in the future, which could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention.The Company is a “controlled company” within the meaning of the NYSE American rules and, as a result, qualifies for, and relies on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. As a result, the Company’s shareholders do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.Nimble Holdings Company Limited (“Nimble”), formerly known as The Grande Holdings Limited, through one of its indirect subsidiaries, is the beneficial owner of approximately 72.4% of the Company’s outstanding common stock as of March 31, 2022. As a result, the Company is a “controlled company” within the meaning of the NYSE American Company Guide. Under the NYSE American rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by another person or group of persons acting together is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain NYSE American corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that: •a majority of the Company’s Board of Directors consist of independent directors;18  •the Company has a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities; and •the Company has a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities.The Company has elected to use certain of these exemptions and the Company may continue to use all or some of these exemptions in the future for so long as the Company is a controlled company. The Company’s Board of Directors acts as the nominating committee and compensation committee and determines the compensation and benefits of the Company’s executive officers, administers its employee stock and benefit plans, as may be in effect from time to time, and reviews policies relating to the compensation and benefits of its employees. Although all board members have fiduciary obligations in connection with compensation matters, the Company’s lack of an independent compensation committee presents the risk that any executive officers who are also directors may have influence over their personal compensation and benefits levels that may not be commensurate with the Company’s financial performance. Accordingly, shareholders of the Company do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE American. The controlling ownership of the Company’s common stock by an indirect subsidiary of Nimble substantially reduces the influence of other stockholders, and the interests of Nimble may conflict with the interests of the Company’s other stockholders. Nimble, through one of its indirect subsidiaries, is the beneficial owner of approximately 72.4% of the Company’s outstanding common stock as of March 31, 2022. As a result, Nimble will be able to exert significant influence over the Company’s business and have the ability to control the approval process for actions by the Company that require stockholder approval, including: the election of the Company’s directors and the approval of mergers, sales of assets or other significant corporate transactions or matters submitted for stockholder approval. Nimble may have interests that differ from your interests and may cause the shares in the Company beneficially owned by Nimble to be voted in a way with which you disagree and that may be adverse to your interests. In addition, several provisions of the Company’s organizational documents and Delaware law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt, including a takeover attempt in which the potential purchaser offers to pay a per share price greater than the current market price of the Company’s common stock. Under the terms of the Company’s certificate of incorporation, its board of directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for the Company’s common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests. The Company’s bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the federal district courts in Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by the Company’s stockholders, which could limit stockholders’ ability to have certain claims heard in any other judicial forum.Pursuant to the Company’s corporate bylaws, as amended (the “bylaws”), unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company; (ii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company or any stockholder to the Company or the Company’s stockholders; (iii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim against the Company or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company or any stockholder arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or the Company’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws (as each may be amended from time to time); (iv) any action or proceeding to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the Company’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws (including any right, obligation or remedy thereunder); (v) any action or proceeding as to which the General Corporation Law of Delaware confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and (vi) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director, officer or other employee of the Company or any stockholder, governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court’s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. This forum selection clause in the Company’s bylaws does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts of the United States of America have exclusive jurisdiction. The bylaws further provide, that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In addition, the bylaws provide that any person or entity holding, owning or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the Company shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to these provisions. The forum selection clause in the Company’s bylaws may limit stockholders’ ability to have certain claims heard in any court other than in the Court of Chancery or the federal district courts in Delaware.19 "
2,MSN,EMERSON RADIO CORP,2021-06-25,">Item 1A. RISK FACTORS The reader should carefully consider these risk factors in addition to those set forth in the Company’s financial statements or the notes thereto. Additional risks about which the Company is not yet aware or that the Company currently believes to be immaterial also may adversely affect the Company’s business operations. If any of the following occur, the Company’s business, financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected. In that case, the price of the Company’s common stock may decline. Business, Operational and Strategic Risks  The Company’s business has been and is expected to continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Company is closely monitoring the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of its operations and regions, including the effect on its consumers, employees, trade customers, suppliers and distribution channels. The pandemic has created significant business disruption and economic uncertainty, which has affected the Company’s supply chain, distribution channels and consumer demand for its products, and has already directly and indirectly affected the Company’s business and operating results. However, the full extent of its impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including the continued spread, duration and severity of the pandemic, the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the availability and distribution of effective vaccines, and public health measures and actions taken in areas in which the Company operates. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any other health epidemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change not only with the spread of the disease, but also with the scope and timing of governmental, regulatory, fiscal, monetary and public health responses. As COVID-19 continues to spread, the Company’s business operations could be further disrupted or delayed. The pandemic has already resulted in, and may continue to result in, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, travel restrictions, event cancellations, and 8other factors that cause an increase in costs or order cancellations, reductions or delays. For example, the Company’s supply chain has been and may in the future be adversely affected with production delays, service disruptions or limited manufacturing volumes associated with shutdowns of factories, logistics providers and shippers or reduced numbers of workers or working hours in the respective facilities, limits on component supplies and diminished capability to implement engineering and design changes in a timely manner. In addition, quarantines, stay at home orders and other travel limitations (whether voluntary or required) may impede the Company’s employees’ ability to efficiently conduct research and development activities or oversee manufacturing and shipping activities, which may slow innovation, lead to higher costs, logistics disruptions or delays in delivering to the Company’s distribution channels and customers. For example, the Company has already experienced an increase in its freight costs. Further, if the COVID-19 pandemic continues and the Company’s operations continue to be adversely affected, the Company risks a delay, default, violation and/or non-compliance under existing agreements. Many of these effects may not be covered by the Company’s existing insurance coverages. The spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, including restrictions on travel and quarantine policies put into place by businesses and governments, has had and may continue to have a material economic effect on the Company’s business. For example, the pandemic and related measures taken to limit the spread of disease has resulted in retail store closures, both temporary and permanent, higher unemployment and greater economic uncertainty, which may adversely affect consumer purchasing behavior. In addition, notwithstanding that vaccines for COVID-19 are now being deployed, consumer fears about becoming ill with the disease, including any variants, may continue, which may adversely affect traffic to retail stores selling the Company’s products. Consumer spending generally may also be negatively affected by general macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence, including the effects of the current recession, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This may negatively affect sales of the Company’s products at retail stores and online marketplace channels and through the Company’s licensing agreements. Any significant reduction in consumer visits to, or spending at, retail stores, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and any decreased spending at retail stores or online caused by decreased consumer confidence and spending following the pandemic, may result in a loss of sales of the Company’s products and profits and other material adverse effects.   While the potential economic effects and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it has already caused, and is likely to result in further, significant disruption of global financial markets. In addition, the current recession has, and a depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business and the market value of its common stock. The Company does not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on its business, its industry or the global economy as a whole, and the Company cannot predict the effects that COVID-19 pandemic-related business disruptions and economic uncertainty will have on its customers, suppliers, consumers, and each of their financial conditions. However, any material effect on these parties could further adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, while significant efforts are underway to slow the spread of COVID-19, including increased testing, widespread vaccination of the public and treatment of those who have contracted COVID-19, it is unclear when or whether progress in any of those areas will translate into an economic recovery that will restore consumer confidence and accelerate consumer spending. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed below in this “Risk Factors
” section, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial condition. Accordingly, given that the potential of these effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operations has been and will likely continue to be material, the Company will continue to monitor the situation closely.The Company relies on a small number of key customers for the majority of its business, and the loss or significant reduction in business with any of these key customers would materially and adversely affect the Company’s revenues and earnings. Certain customers have historically made up a significant percentage of the Company’s product sales and net revenues. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, Walmart, Amazon.com and Fred Meyer accounted for approximately 37%, 33% and 11%, respectively, of the Company’s net revenues. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, Walmart, Amazon.com and Fred Meyer accounted for approximately 44%, 25% and 11%, respectively, of the Company’s net revenues. The Company expects that its online marketplaces will increasingly represent a significant portion of the Company’s product sales going forward. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net revenues during these periods. All customer purchases are made through purchase orders and the Company does not have any long-term contracts with its customers. Accordingly, sales from customers that have accounted for a significant portion of the Company’s net product sales and net revenues in past periods, individually or as a group, may not continue in future periods, or if continued, may not reach or exceed historical levels in any period, which has happened in the past and could happen in the future. Some of the Company’s key customers may also experience economic difficulties or otherwise default on their obligations to the Company. The complete loss of, or significant reduction in business from, or a material adverse change in the financial condition of, any of the Company’s key customers would cause a material and adverse change in the Company’s revenues and operating results.9The Company is dependent on a limited number of products for its sales. The Company derives a substantial portion of its product revenues from a limited number of products, and the Company expects these products to continue to account for a large percentage of its product revenues in the near term. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2021, the Company’s gross product sales were comprised principally of four product types within two categories — housewares products and audio products — and microwave ovens, which product type is within the housewares category — generated approximately 35% of the Company’s gross product sales. Audio products generated approximately 63% of the Company’s gross product sales during fiscal 2021. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, the Company’s gross product sales were comprised principally of the same four product types within the same two categories — housewares products and audio products — and microwave ovens, which product type is within the housewares category, generated approximately 35% of the Company’s gross product sales. Audio products generated approximately 61% of the Company’s gross product sales during fiscal 2020. Because the market for these product types and categories is characterized by periodic new product introductions, the Company’s future financial performance will depend, in part, on the successful and timely development and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of these product types and other products distributed by the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in marketing these product types within these categories or any other new or enhanced products. For example, certain of the Company’s key customers perform periodic line reviews to assess their product offerings, which have in the past and may in the future lead to loss of business and pricing pressures. As a result of this dependence, a significant decline in pricing of, or market acceptance of these product types and categories, either in general or specifically as marketed by the Company, would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operation. The loss or reduction of business of one or a combination of its houseware and audio product lines could materially adversely affect the Company’s revenues, financial condition and results of operations.If the Company’s third party sales representatives fail to adequately promote, market and sell the Company’s products, the Company’s revenues could significantly decrease. A significant portion of the Company’s product sales are made through third party sales representative organizations, whose members are not employees of the Company. The Company’s level of sales depends on the effectiveness of these organizations, as well as the effectiveness of its own employees. Some of these third party representatives may sell (and do sell), with the Company’s permission, competitive products of third parties as well as the Company’s products. During the Company’s fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020, these organizations were responsible for approximately 87% and 87%, respectively, of its net revenues during such periods. In addition, one of these representative organizations was responsible for a significant portion of these revenues. If any of the Company’s third party sales representative organizations engaged by the Company, especially the Company’s largest, fails to adequately promote, market and sell its products, the Company’s revenues could be significantly decreased until a replacement organization or distributor could be retained by the Company, which has happened in the past and could happen in the future. The loss or reduction of product sales made through third party sales representative organizations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. Finding replacement organizations and distributors could be a time consuming process during which the Company’s revenues could be negatively impacted. The concentration of product sales among a limited number of retailers and the trend toward private label brands could materially reduce revenues and profitability.With the concentration of the Company’s product sales among a limited number of retailers, the Company is dependent upon a small number of customers whose bargaining strength is growing. These retailers generally purchase a limited selection of houseware and consumer electronics products. As a result, there is significant competition for retail shelf space. In addition, certain of the Company’s key customers use their own private label brands that compete directly with some of the Company’s products. As the retailers in the houseware and consumer electronics industry become more concentrated, competition for sales to these retailers may increase, which could materially reduce the Company's revenues and profitability.The houseware and consumer electronics industry is consolidating, which could reduce the Company’s ability to successfully secure product placements at key customers and limit its ability to sustain a cost competitive position in the industry.Over the past several years, the houseware and consumer electronics industry has undergone substantial consolidation, and further consolidation is likely. As a result of this consolidation, the houseware and consumer electronics industry primarily consists of a limited number of large retailers and distributors. The Company’s ability to gain or maintain its share of sales in the houseware and consumer electronics industry or maintain or enhance its relationships with key customers may be limited as a result of actions by competitors or the retailers’ increasing use of private label brands.10The failure to obtain new licensees and distribution relationships or to maintain relationships with its existing licensees and distributors could materially and adversely affect the Company’s revenues, earnings and business.The Company maintains agreements that allow licensees to use the Company’s trademarks for the manufacture and sale of specific consumer electronics and other products into defined geographic areas. These agreements typically are for a limited period of time and, upon expiration, the Company cannot assure that its agreements with its licensees will be renewed in the future or that the Company’s relationships with its licensees or distributors will be maintained on satisfactory terms or at all. Although the Company has engaged LMCA as an agent to assist the Company in identifying and procuring licensing opportunities, there can be no assurance that the Company will find and secure suitable licensees or distribution relationships. If the Company is unable to maintain its relationships with its licensees and distributors on terms satisfactory to the Company, or if it fails to obtain new licensees or distribution relationships or the Company’s licensees fail to protect the integrity and reputation of the Company’s trademarks, the value of the Emerson brand and the Company’s licensing revenues and earnings could be materially and adversely affected. The Company depends on a limited number of suppliers for its products. If its relationships with such suppliers terminate or are otherwise impaired, the Company would likely experience increased costs, disruptions in the manufacture and shipment of its products and a material loss of net sales. Although there are multiple potential suppliers for each of the Company’s products, the Company relies and is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for its main products, all of which are located outside of the United States. The Company does not have any long-term or exclusive purchase commitments with any of its suppliers. Itoma was the Company’s largest supplier and accounted for 59% of the Company’s purchases of products during fiscal 2021. The Company’s failure to maintain existing relationships with its suppliers or to establish new relationships on similar pricing and credit terms in the future could negatively affect the Company’s ability to obtain products in a timely manner. If the Company is unable to obtain an ample supply of product from its existing suppliers or secure alternative sources of supply, it may be unable to satisfy its customers’ orders, which could materially and adversely affect the Company’s revenues and relationships with its customers. Finding replacement suppliers could be a time consuming process during which the Company’s revenues and liquidity could be negatively impacted.The Company’s products use raw materials and components that may be subject to price fluctuations, shortages or interruptions of supply, and if the Company is unable to maintain supply sources for such raw materials and components, or if such sources fail to satisfy the Company’s supply requirements, the Company may experience a loss of sales, increased component costs and reduced profitability. Factors that are largely beyond the Company’s control, such as the cost, quality and availability of the raw materials and components needed by suppliers of the Company’s products, may affect the cost of such products, and the Company may not be able to pass those costs on to its customers. The Company’s products use raw materials and components that may be subject to price fluctuations, shortages or interruptions of supply, including semiconductor chips that have been subject to an ongoing significant shortage. The cost, quality and availability of these components are essential to the successful production and sale of the Company’s products. If the Company is unable to maintain supply sources of these raw materials and components, or if such sources fail to satisfy the Company’s supply requirements, the Company may lose sales and experience increased component costs. In particular, the Company utilizes semiconductor chips in its housewares products and audio products. Because semiconductor chips have been recently subject to an ongoing significant shortage, the Company’s ability to source these important components that use semiconductor chips has been adversely affected. These supply interruptions have resulted in increased component delivery lead times, delays in product production and increased costs to obtain components with available semiconductor chips. To the extent this semiconductor chip shortage continues, the production ability of the Company’s suppliers may continue to be impacted. Although the Company is seeking alternate sources of supply of these components, it may take several months to locate alternative suppliers or require the re-tooling of products to accommodate components from different suppliers. If the Company or its suppliers are unable to obtain components from third parties in the quantities and of the quality that the Company requires, on a timely basis and at acceptable prices, the Company may not be able to deliver its products on a timely or cost-effective basis to its customers, which could cause customers to terminate their contracts with the Company, reduce the Company’s gross margins and seriously harm its business, results of operations and financial condition. If the Company is unable to deliver products in the required amounts and in a timely fashion, the Company could experience delays or reductions in shipments to its customers, which could materially and adversely affect the Company’s revenues and relationships with its customers. The Company’s ability to provide high quality customer service, process and fulfill orders, and manage inventory depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation and timely and uninterrupted performance of its suppliers. The Company can provide no assurances that it will not experience operational difficulties with its suppliers, including reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines, increases 11in manufacturing costs, increased lead times or production shutdowns or production slowdowns due to social distancing guidelines or issues with absenteeism related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which have and could in the future result in increased costs and decreased efficiency. If the Company is unable to obtain products from these factories in the required quantities and quality and in a timely fashion, the Company could experience delays or reductions in product shipments to its customers, which could negatively affect the Company’s ability to meet the requirements of its customers, as well as its relationships with its customers, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the Company’s revenues and operating results. In addition, shipping rates and surcharges are volatile and subject to market fluctuations, and any increases in shipping costs may reduce the Company’s margins and adversely affect its profitability.All the Company’s suppliers are based in China and as a result the Company is subject to risks associated with international operations and global manufacturing and sourcing including, among others:  •currency fluctuations;  •labor disputes and union actions that can disrupt the Company’s ability to ship products to customers;  •potential political, economic and social instability;  •public health threats, including the COVID-19 pandemic, inclement weather and natural disasters;  •possible acts of terrorism;  •restrictions on transfers of funds;  •changes in import and export duties and quotas;  •changes in domestic and international customs and tariffs;  •uncertainties involving the costs to transport products;  •disruptions in the global transportation network, including port backlogs and availability of shipping containers;  •unexpected changes in regulatory environments;  •regulatory issues involved in dealing with foreign suppliers and in exporting and importing products;  •protection of intellectual property;  •difficulty in complying with a variety of foreign laws;  •difficulty in obtaining distribution and support; and  •potentially adverse tax consequences. Furthermore, any material disruption, slowdown or shutdown of the operations of the Company’s principal logistics providers and shippers, including without limitation as a result of labor disputes, public health threats (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), social unrest, inclement weather, natural disasters, possible acts of terrorism, availability of shipping containers and increased security restrictions, could cause delays in the Company’s ability to receive, process and fulfill customer orders and may cause orders to be canceled, lost or delivered late, goods to be returned or receipt of goods to be refused. These and other factors described above have and could continue to cause increases in shipping and storage costs. As a result, the Company’s relationships with its customers, revenues and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. The Company relies on a third-party logistics provider for the storage and distribution of its products in the United States and, if such third party logistics provider incurs any damage to the facilities where the Company’s products are stored or is unable to distribute its products as needed, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and business. The Company relies on a third-party logistics provider for the storage and distribution of its products. The facilities where the Company’s products are stored by such provider may also be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, power outages, communications failure or terrorism. Any material damage to the facilities where the Company’s products are stored could adversely affect its inventory and the ability of such third-party logistics provider to meet the needs of its customers. In addition, an inability to maintain the Company’s contracts with such third-party logistics provider or a delay, disruption or quality control problems in the operations of such third-party logistics provider, including as a result of damage to the facilities of such provider or a strike by such provider’s workers, could cause delays in the Company’s ability to fulfill customer orders and may cause orders to be canceled, lost or delivered late, the Company’s products to be returned or receipt of products to be refused, any of which could adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations. The Company’s contract with its third-party logistics provider is terminable upon written notice by either party for convenience without cause. If the Company is unable to maintain its contract with its third-party logistics provider, the Company would be required to retain a new third party logistics 12provider and the Company may be unable to retain such third party at a cost that is acceptable to the Company. If the Company’s shipping costs were to increase as a result of an increase in the fees charged by such third-party logistics provider or as a result of obtaining a new third-party logistics provider and if the Company is unable to pass on these higher costs to its customers, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and business. The Company’s revenues and earnings could be materially and adversely affected if it cannot anticipate market trends, enhance existing products or achieve market acceptance of new products. The Company’s success is dependent on its ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands and trends in a timely manner, as well as expanding into new markets and sourcing new products that are profitable to the Company. In addition, to increase the Company’s penetration of current markets and gain footholds in new markets for its products, the Company must maintain its existing products and integrate them with new products. The Company may not be successful in sourcing, marketing and releasing new products that respond to technological developments or changing customer needs and preferences. The Company may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and sale of these new products. These new products may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and may not achieve any significant degree of market acceptance. If release dates of any future products or enhancements to the Company’s products are delayed, or if these products or enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance when released, the Company’s sales volume may decline and earnings could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, new products or enhancements by the Company’s competitors may cause customers to defer or forgo purchases of the Company’s products, which could also materially and adversely affect the Company’s revenues and earnings. Cash generated by operating activities represents the Company’s principal source of funding and therefore the Company depends on its ability to successfully manage its operating cash flows to fund its operations. The Company does not maintain any credit facilities (other than, from time to time, certain letters of credit) in connection with the operation of its business. The Company has relied on, and continues to rely on, its cash on hand and cash generated by operations to manage its business. Certain of the Company’s major factory suppliers, including Itoma, extend credit lines to the Company in amounts based on various factors, including the amounts of the Company’s purchases and their internal credit criteria, and in the past have reduced the maximum amount of open credit lines available to the Company. The loss of, or reduction in, credit lines from the Company’s principal suppliers could reduce the Company’s liquidity, increase its working capital needs or limit its ability to purchase products which in turn could adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, the Company may need to secure alternative means of financing or reorganize its operations to continue to maintain its current business.The Company is subject to intense competition in the industry in which it operates, which could cause material changes in the selling price of its products or losses of its market share. The housewares and consumer electronics industry is highly competitive, especially with respect to pricing and the introduction of new products and features. The Company’s products compete in the low to medium-priced sector of the housewares and consumer electronics market and compete primarily on the basis of reliability, brand recognition, quality, price, design, consumer acceptance of the Emerson® trademark and quality service and support to retailers and its customers. The Company and many of its competitors are subject to factory cost increases, and the Company expects these pressures to continue. If these pressures are not mitigated by increases in selling price or cost reductions from the Company’s suppliers or changes in product mix, or if the consumers of the Company’s products change their buying habits as a result of the Company’s actions, the Company’s revenues and profits could be substantially reduced. In addition, the Company’s expanded marketing plan includes sales through online marketplaces, including Amazon.com, and the success of this plan depends on the Company’s ability to increase its visibility and continue to distribute its products through these online marketplaces. As compared to the Company, many of its competitors have significantly greater managerial, financial, marketing, technical and other competitive resources and greater brand recognition. As a result, the Company’s competitors may be able to (i) adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements; (ii) devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services; and (iii) respond more effectively to pricing pressures. Competition could increase if new companies enter the market, existing competitors expand their product mix or the Company expands into new markets. An increase in competition could result in material price reductions or loss of the Company’s market share. In addition, the industry in which the Company competes generally has low barriers to entry that allow the introduction of new products or new competitors at a fast pace. Some retailers have and may continue to introduce their own private label products, which could reduce the volume of products they buy from the Company, as well as decrease the shelf space they allocate to the Company’s products. If the Company is unable to protect the Company’s brand image and authenticity, the Company may be unable to effectively compete with these new market entrants or new products. 13Changes in consumer spending and economic conditions may cause the Company’s operating results to fluctuate and cause its stock price to decline. The Company’s net revenue and operating results may vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter as well as in comparison to the corresponding quarter of the preceding year. Factors that may cause these variations include:  •changes in market and economic conditions;  •the discretionary nature of consumers’ demands and spending patterns;  •variations in the sales of the Company’s products to its significant customers;  •variations in manufacturing and supplier relationships;  •if the Company is unable to correctly anticipate and provide for inventory requirements, it may not have sufficient inventory to deliver its products to its customers in a timely fashion or the Company may have excess inventory that it is unable to sell;  •new product developments or introductions;  •product reviews and other media coverage;  •competition, including competitive price pressures; and  •political instability, war, acts of terrorism, public health threats, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or other disasters. As a result of any of these factors, the Company’s operating results may fluctuate significantly, which may in turn cause its stock price to decline. Legal, Regulatory and Tax RisksForeign regulations and changes in trade policies and the political, social and economic conditions in the United States and the foreign countries in which the Company operates its business could affect the Company’s revenues and earnings materially and adversely. The Company has operations in China and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sales of products manufactured by third parties located in China. In addition, third parties located in China and other countries located in the same region produce and supply many of the components and raw materials used in the Company’s products. Additionally, a significant portion of the shipping of the Company’s finished goods to the United States occurs through Hong Kong. Conducting an international business inherently involves a number of difficulties and risks that could materially and adversely affect the Company’s ability to generate revenues and could subject the Company to increased costs. The diplomatic tensions between the United States and China, including over China’s enactment of the Hong Kong national security law, create uncertainties for doing business in China, and the risk of additional protectionist trade policies and tariffs or other escalating retaliatory policies, such as the passage of the Hong Kong Autonomy Act in July 2020 and the concurrent U.S. executive order that ended the special economic status afforded to Hong Kong under the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, could increase the Company’s cost of doing business and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the current U.S. administration will alter the existing trade agreements between China and the U.S. or otherwise modify or impose additional tariffs on imports from China. It is possible that further tariffs may be imposed on the categories of products the Company imports to the United States, or that the Company’s business will be affected by retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response to existing or future tariffs, causing the Company to raise prices or make changes to its operations, any of which could adversely affect demand for the Company’s products or increase its costs.Among the other factors that may adversely affect the Company’s revenues and increase its costs are:  •currency fluctuations which could cause an increase in the price of the components and raw materials used in the Company’s products and a decrease in its profits;  •Chinese labor laws;  •labor shortages affecting the Company’s facilities and its suppliers’ manufacturing facilities located in China;  •the elimination or reduction of value-added tax refunds to Chinese factories that manufacture products for export; 14  •the rise of inflation and substantial economic growth in China;  •more stringent export restrictions in the countries in which the Company operates which could adversely affect its ability to deliver its products to its customers;  •tariffs and other trade barriers which could make it more expensive for the Company to obtain and deliver its products to its customers; •increases in shipping costs for the Company’s products or other service issues with the Company’s third-party shippers, such as global availability of shipping containers and fuel costs;  •political instability and economic downturns in these countries which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to obtain its products from its manufacturers or deliver its products to its customers in a timely fashion;  •outbreaks of public health threats, such as COVID-19, influenza and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, affecting the production capabilities of the Company’s suppliers, including as a result of quarantines or closures; •new restrictions on the sale of electronic products containing certain hazardous substances; and  •the laws of China are likely to govern many of the Company’s supplier agreements. Any of the factors described above may materially and adversely affect the Company’s revenues and/or increase its operating expenses. Tariffs or other restrictions placed on the Company’s products imported into the United States from China, or any related countermeasures taken by China, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, profitability and results of operations. The Company has operations in China and all of the Company’s products are currently manufactured by suppliers in China. Any tariffs or other trade restrictions affecting the import of these products to the United States from China or any retaliatory trade measures taken by China in response to existing or future tariffs could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations going forward. The Company’s dependency on its overseas suppliers could exacerbate these and other risks, and any tariffs on the categories of products the Company imports to the United States could negatively affect the demand for such products, increase the cost of components, delay production or affect the Company’s ability to compete against competitors who do not manufacture in China or otherwise are not subject to such tariffs.Beginning in 2018, the United States has imposed additional duties, ranging from 10% to 25%, on a variety of goods imported from China. Effective in September 2018, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (“USTR”) imposed tariffs of 10% on approximately $200 billion worth of goods imported from China (“List 3 products”), including categories of products the Company imports from China and increased these tariffs to 25% effective in May 2019. In August 2019, the U.S. administration directed the USTR to increase tariffs on List 3 products from 25% to 30% effective October 2019, which increases were subsequently delayed indefinitely. In May 2019, the USTR proposed imposing additional tariffs of up to 25% on essentially all remaining Chinese-origin imports, including approximately $300 billion worth of goods imported from China (“List 4 products”). Tariffs of 15% were imposed on certain List 4 products effective in September 2019 (“List 4A products”), and the remainder were scheduled to be subject to these tariffs effective in December 2019 (“List 4B products”). In January 2020, the United States and China signed a Phase One Economic and Trade Agreement, pursuant to which the tariff increases on the List 4B products remained suspended and the rate of additional tariffs on the List 4A products was reduced to 7.5%, while all other tariffs remain in place. The effects on the Company of these imposed and proposed tariffs are uncertain because of the dynamic nature of governmental actions and responses, as well as possible exemptions for certain products. If the U.S. and China are able to negotiate the issues to restore a mutually advantageous and fair trading regime, the increased tariffs could be eliminated, but given the uncertainties, including as a result of the recent change in U.S. administrations and any other political changes, there can be no assurance of whether, or when, this will be accomplished. If the currently imposed and proposed tariffs covering the categories of products that the Company imports continue or are increased, and the Company is unable to obtain an exception, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.Although the Company is monitoring the trade environment and working to mitigate the effects of tariffs through pricing and sourcing strategies, including through proactive management of inventory built up in advance of the recent tariff increases, and may take additional steps, the Company cannot be certain how its customers and competitors will react to the actions taken. Additional tariffs imposed by the United States, and any related countermeasures by China, including as a result of the heightened tensions between the United States and China over Hong Kong, could increase the Company’s cost of goods and reduce its gross margins. If 15the Company determines to pass some or all of these new tariff burdens on to its customers as product price increases in the future, the result may be a degradation of the Company’s competitive position and a loss of customers that would adversely affect the Company’s operating performance. However, the ultimate outcome of these tariff actions is not clear at this time, and there can be no assurances that the Company’s mitigation efforts will be successful or that the imposition of any such tariffs or trade actions would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s revenue, gross margins and operating results.The Company could be exposed to product liability or other claims for which its product liability or other insurance may be inadequate. A failure of any of the products marketed by the Company may subject it to the risk of product liability claims and litigation arising from injuries allegedly caused by the improper functioning or design of its products. Although the Company currently maintains product liability insurance in amounts which the Company considers adequate, the Company cannot assure that:  •its insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities;  •adequate product liability insurance will continue to be available in the future; or  •its insurance can be maintained on acceptable terms. To the extent product liability or other litigation losses are beyond the limits or scope of the Company’s insurance coverage, the Company’s expenses could materially increase. The Company’s business could be materially and adversely affected if it cannot protect its intellectual property rights or if it infringes on the intellectual property rights of others. The Company’s ability to compete effectively depends on its ability to maintain and protect its proprietary rights. The Company owns the Emerson® and other trademarks, which are materially important to its business, as well as other trademarks, licenses and proprietary rights that are used for certain of the products that it markets and sells. The Company’s trademarks are registered throughout the world, including the United States and other countries. The laws of some foreign countries in which the Company operates may not protect the Company’s proprietary rights to the same extent as do laws in the United States. The protections afforded by the laws of such countries may not be adequate to protect the Company’s intellectual property rights. Third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate, circumvent or render unenforceable any trademarks, patents or proprietary rights owned by or licensed to the Company. In addition, in the event third-party licensees fail to protect the integrity of the Company’s trademarks, the value of these marks could be materially and adversely affected. The Company’s inability to protect its proprietary rights could materially and adversely affect the license of its trade names, trademarks and other proprietary rights to third parties as well as its ability to sell its products. Litigation has been and may in the future be necessary to enforce the Company’s intellectual property rights, protect the Company’s trade secrets and determine the scope and validity of such intellectual property rights. Any such litigation, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management’s attention from the operation of the Company’s business. The Company may receive notices of claims of infringement of other parties’ proprietary rights. Such actions could result in litigation and the Company could incur significant costs and diversion of resources in defending such claims. The party making such claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief. Such relief could effectively block the Company’s ability to make, use, sell, distribute or market its products and services in certain jurisdictions. The Company may also be required to seek licenses to such intellectual property. The Company cannot predict, however, whether such licenses would be available or, if available, that such licenses could be obtained on terms that are commercially reasonable and acceptable to the Company. The failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could delay or preclude the sale, manufacture or distribution of its products and could result in increased costs to the Company.An information systems interruption or breach in security, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and reputation.In the ordinary course of business, the Company electronically maintains sensitive data, including intellectual property, its proprietary business information and that of its customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information of employees, in its facilities and on its networks. In addition, the Company sells its products through online marketplaces, including Amazon.com, which rely upon third-party online payment platform service providers that maintain personal information collected from customers. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to the Company’s operations. A breach of the Company’s security systems and procedures or those of its vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of the Company’s 16customers’ or the Company’s employees’ intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information.  A cybersecurity breach could negatively affect the Company’s reputation. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software or applications the Company procures from third parties or uses in its online marketplaces may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to the Company’s systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving its employees. Accordingly, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, or if such measures are implemented, and even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures, human errors may still occur. It is virtually impossible for the Company to entirely mitigate this risk. A party, whether internal or external, who is able to circumvent the Company’s security measures or those of its vendors could misappropriate information.If the Company or the online payment platforms it uses fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information, the Company may suffer significant reputational and financial losses and the Company’s results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and liquidity may be adversely affected. In addition, a system breach could result in other negative consequences, including disruption of internal operations, and may subject the Company to private litigation, government investigations, enforcement actions, and cause the Company to incur potentially significant liability, damages, or remediation costs.Fluctuations in the Company’s tax obligations and effective tax rate and realization of deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, may result in volatility of the Company’s operating results.The Company is subject to income taxes in various U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company records tax expense based on its estimates of future payments, which may include reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions, and valuation allowances related to certain net deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards. In addition, tax laws in certain jurisdictions may limit the ability to use net operating loss carryforwards upon a change in control. At any one time, many tax years may be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. In addition, the Company’s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to changes in the mix and level of revenues, varying tax rates in the different jurisdictions in which the Company operates, fluctuations in the valuation allowance, timing of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards, or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations. Further, tax legislation or changes in tax rules and regulations or the interpretations thereof, including but not limited to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, may be enacted in the future which could negatively affect the Company’s current or future tax structure and effective tax rates.Corporate Governance and Stock Ownership RisksThere is a limited trading market for the Company’s common stock and the market price of the Company’s common stock is subject to volatility.The Company’s common stock, which trades on the NYSE American, has experienced, and may experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of the Company’s common stock. For example, the Company believes that recent volatility in the market price of the Company’s common stock reflects market and trading dynamics unrelated to the Company’s underlying business or macro or industry fundamentals. These fluctuations have been accompanied by reports of strong and atypical retail investor interest, including on social media and online forums. The Company may continue to incur rapid and substantial increases or decreases in its stock price that may not coincide in timing with the disclosure of news or developments by or affecting the Company. Accordingly, the market price of the Company’s common stock may fluctuate dramatically, and may decline rapidly, regardless of any developments in the Company’s business. The market price of the Company’s common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to various factors and events, including: •the ongoing impacts and developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic; •actual or anticipated variations in operating results and cash flows; •loss of a key customer, licensee or supplier; •announcements or events that affect the Company’s products, customers, competitors or markets; •general business conditions in the markets and industry in which the Company competes; •changes in market valuations of similar companies; •the increase in the number of individual holders of the Company’s common stock and their participation in social media platforms targeted at speculative investing; 17 •the level of the Company’s stock repurchase activity;  •concentration of holdings of the Company’s common stock; and •other events or factors, including those listed under this section entitled “Risk Factors
.”In addition, the securities markets have recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies due to, among other factors, the actions of market participants or other actions outside of the Company’s control, including general market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, regulatory and market conditions, may negatively impact the market price of the Company’s common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. The Company may be the target of this type of litigation in the future, which could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention.The Company is a “controlled company” within the meaning of the NYSE American rules and, as a result, qualifies for, and relies on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. As a result, the Company’s shareholders do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.Nimble Holdings Company Limited (“Nimble”), formerly known as The Grande Holdings Limited (“Grande”), through one of its indirect subsidiaries, is the beneficial owner of approximately 72.4% of the Company’s outstanding common stock as of March 31, 2021. As a result, the Company is a “controlled company” within the meaning of the NYSE American Company Guide. Under the NYSE American rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by another person or group of persons acting together is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain NYSE American corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that: •a majority of the Company’s Board of Directors consist of independent directors; •the Company has a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities; and •the Company has a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities.The Company has elected to use certain of these exemptions and the Company may continue to use all or some of these exemptions in the future for so long as the Company is a controlled company. The Company’s Board of Directors acts as the nominating committee and compensation committee and determines the compensation and benefits of the Company’s executive officers, administers its employee stock and benefit plans, as may be in effect from time to time, and reviews policies relating to the compensation and benefits of its employees. Although all board members have fiduciary obligations in connection with compensation matters, the Company’s lack of an independent compensation committee presents the risk that any executive officers who are also directors may have influence over their personal compensation and benefits levels that may not be commensurate with the Company’s financial performance. Accordingly, shareholders of the Company do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE American. The controlling ownership of the Company’s common stock by an indirect subsidiary of Nimble substantially reduces the influence of other stockholders, and the interests of Nimble may conflict with the interests of the Company’s other stockholders. Nimble, through one of its indirect subsidiaries, is the beneficial owner of approximately 72.4% of the Company’s outstanding common stock as of March 31, 2021. As a result, Nimble will be able to exert significant influence over the Company’s business and have the ability to control the approval process for actions by the Company that require stockholder approval, including: the election of the Company’s directors and the approval of mergers, sales of assets or other significant corporate transactions or matters submitted for stockholder approval. Nimble may have interests that differ from your interests and may cause the shares in the Company beneficially owned by Nimble to be voted in a way with which you disagree and that may be adverse to your interests. In addition, several provisions of the Company’s organizational documents and Delaware law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt, including a takeover attempt in which the potential purchaser offers to pay a per share price greater than the current market price of the Company’s common stock. Under the terms of the Company’s certificate of incorporation, its board of directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for the Company’s common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests. 18The Company’s bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the federal district courts in Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by the Company’s stockholders, which could limit stockholders’ ability to have certain claims heard in any other judicial forum.Pursuant to the Company’s corporate bylaws, as amended (the “bylaws”), unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company; (ii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company or any stockholder to the Company or the Company’s stockholders; (iii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim against the Company or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company or any stockholder arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or the Company’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws (as each may be amended from time to time); (iv) any action or proceeding to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the Company’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws (including any right, obligation or remedy thereunder); (v) any action or proceeding as to which the General Corporation Law of Delaware confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and (vi) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director, officer or other employee of the Company or any stockholder, governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court’s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. This forum selection clause in the Company’s bylaws does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts of the United States of America have exclusive jurisdiction. The bylaws further provide, that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In addition, the bylaws provide that any person or entity holding, owning or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the Company shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to these provisions. The forum selection clause in the Company’s bylaws may limit stockholders’ ability to have certain claims heard in any court other than in the Court of Chancery or the federal district courts in Delaware"
0,MSN,EMERSON RADIO CORP,2008-07-11,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
     You should carefully consider these risk factors in addition to those set forth in ourfinancial statements or the notes thereto. Additional risks about which we do not yet know or thatwe currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely affect our business operations. If any ofthe following occur, our business, financial condition or operating results may be adverselyaffected. In that case, the price of our common stock may decline.Business Related RisksIf we are unable to resist price increases from our suppliers or pass through such increases to ourcustomers, our profit margins will shrink or be eliminated entirely.     Substantially all of our products are purchased from suppliers with factories located in thePeoples Republic of China (China). The weakness of the United States dollar in relationship tothe Chinese currency has increased substantially the cost of the products we purchase from suchsuppliers. These suppliers also have experienced sharply rising costs attributable to, among otherthings, substantially increased raw material costs, general economic conditions and changes incertain labor, public health and tax regulations in China. As a consequence, many of our suppliershave proposed substantial price increases for the products we purchase from them. We are resistingsuch increases and, at the same time, proposing higher product sale prices to our customers, themost substantial ofwhich are among the largest retail chains in the country. These customers have stronglyresisted accepting our proposed increased pricing given the recent decline in economic conditionsin the United States and the fear that higher prices will drive away their already fragile customerbases. The pricing situation with our suppliers and customers is unclear and there can be noassurance that we will be able to work out an acceptable solution. In addition, if we are unableto negotiate lower costs with our suppliers, higher prices from our customers or some combinationof the two, our sales likely will decline, our profit margins will shrink and our operating resultsmay be materially and adversely affected.The majority ownership of our common stock by subsidiaries of The Grande Holdings Limited, a HongKong based group of companies, substantially reduces the influence of other stockholders.     The Grande Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries (collectively, Grande) ownapproximately 57.6% of our outstanding common stock as of June 30, 2008. As a result, Grandecurrently controls or influences significantly the approval process for actions that requirestockholder approval, including: the election of our directors and the approval of mergers, salesof assets or other significant corporate transactions or matters submitted for stockholderapproval.Because of Grandes ownership position, other stockholders have little or no influenceover matters submitted for stockholder approval.13 A number of our directors and senior executive officers also are managing directors or seniorofficers of Grande and have loyalties and fiduciary obligations to both Grande and Emerson; thosedual positions subject such persons to conflicts of interest in related party transactions whichmay cause such related party transactions to have consequences to us that are less favorable thanthose which we could have attained in comparable transactions with unaffiliated entities..     Each of Christopher Ho, our Chairman of the Board, Adrian Ma, our Chief Executive Officer andMichael A.B. Binney, a director, is a Managing Director of Grande. In addition, Messrs. Ho and Maserve, respectively, as the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Grande. Theserelationships create, or, at a minimum, appear to create potential conflicts of interest whenmembers of our senior management are faced with decisions that could have different implicationsfor us and Grande. As described in Note 3 to our financial statements and in our previous filingswith the SEC, there have been a number of related party transactions between us and Grande whichhave been viewed as possibly problematic. In addition, Grande has failed to pay, on a timelybasis, amounts due and payable to us in connection with our related party transactions. AlthoughGrande currently does not owe us any amounts under our existing related party transactions, wecannot assure you that Grande, in the future, will pay any amounts that become due and payable tous under our existing or future related party transactions on a timely basis or at all.     Although we have established procedures designed to insure that future material related partytransactions are fair to us, no assurance can be given as to how potentially conflicted boardmembers or officers will evaluate their fiduciary duties to us and Grande, respectively, or howsuch individuals will act in such circumstances. Furthermore, the appearance of conflicts, even ifsuch conflicts ultimately do not harm us, might adversely affect the publics perception ofEmerson, as well as our relationship with our existing customers, licensors and licensees and ourability to enter into new relationships in the future.Although our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting, as suchterm is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f), was effective as of March 31, 2008,we have previously identified material weaknesses in our internal controls. If we are unable tomaintain appropriate internal controls and procedures, it could cause us to fail to meet ourreporting obligations on a timely basis, result in the restatement of our financial statements,harm our operating results, limit our access to credit facilities necessary to fund our operations,subject us to regulatory scrutiny and sanction, cause investors to lose confidence in the ourreported financial information and have a negative effect on the market price for shares of ourcommon stock.     Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. Wemaintain a system of internal controls over financial reporting, which is defined as a processdesigned by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financialofficer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our board of directors,management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability offinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordancewith generally accepted accounting principles.     Based on our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reportingunder the framework in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the14 Committee ofSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, our management concluded that our internalcontrol over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2008. The process of designing andimplementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate andreact to changes in our business and management and the economic and regulatory environments and toexpend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfyour reporting obligations as a public company.     As previously disclosed under Item 9A  Controls and Procedures of our Annual Report Form10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 (the 2007 Annual Report), certain events in fiscal2007 revealed material weaknesses in our internal controls. As previously disclosed, as part ofour efforts to remedy such material weaknesses, in December 2007, our Board of Directors adopted aseries of corporate governance and control policies and procedures that were recommended by ourAudit Committee. Our Audit Committee continues to assign the highest priority to the improvementof our internal controls over financial reporting and has taken, and will continue to take, actionin furtherance of such improvement and in response to the events described under Item 9A Controls and Procedures of the 2007 Annual Report. We cannot assure you that such remediationefforts will be effective to prevent events or actions which are inconsistent with our internalcontrols or that it will not, in the future, identify further areas requiring improvement in ourinternal control over financial reporting or that our internal controls will not be circumvented.     If we are unable to maintain appropriate internal financial reporting controls and proceduresor if such controls and procedures are not complied with, it could cause us to fail to meet ourreporting obligations, result in the restatement of our financial statements, harm our operatingresults, limit our access to credit facilities necessary to fund our operations, subject us toregulatory scrutiny andsanction, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have anegative effect on the market price for shares of our common stockThe loss or significant reduction in business of any of our key customers, including Wal-Mart,Target, and Kmart, could materially and adversely affect our revenues and earnings.     We are highly dependent upon sales of our products to Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart. For thefiscal years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007, Wal-Mart represented approximately 35% and 30%,respectively, Target stores accounted for approximately 24% and 21%, respectively, and Kmart storesrepresented approximately 7% and 6%, respectively, of our net revenues. Except for non-recurringpromotional item sales to ESI International in fiscal 2007, which were 12% of net revenues, noother customer accounted for greater than 10% of our net revenues during these periods. Allcustomer purchases are made through purchase orders and we do not have any long-term contracts withcustomers. The complete loss of, or significant reduction in business from, or a material adversechange in the financial condition of, Wal-Mart, Target or Kmart will cause a material and adversechange in our revenues and operating results.We depend on a limited number of suppliers for our products. The inability to secure our productscould reduce our revenues and adversely affect our relationship with our customers.     We rely on a limited number of suppliers for our component parts and raw materials, most ofwhich are located outside of the United States. Although there are many suppliers for each of ourcomponent parts and raw materials, we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for many of15 the significant components and raw materials. This reliance involves a number of significantpotential risks, including:  lack of availability of materials and interruptions in delivery of components andraw materials from our suppliers;   manufacturing delays caused by such lack of availability or interruptions indelivery;   fluctuations in the quality and the price of components and raw materials, inparticular due to the petroleum price impact on such materials; and   risks related to foreign operations.     We do not have any long-term or exclusive purchase commitments with any of our suppliers.Galanz, Midea and Lasco Industries were our largest suppliers of our products during fiscal 2008,each of which accounted for more than 10% of our purchases of products for our latest fiscal year.Lasco Industries has closed its manufacturing operations in China and is not expected to reopen.Our failure to maintain existing relationships with our suppliers or to establish new relationshipsin the future could negatively affect our ability to obtain our products in a timely manner. If weare unable to obtain ample supply of product from our existing suppliers or alternative sources ofsupply, we may be unable to satisfy our customers orders, which could materially and adverselyaffect our revenues and our relationship with our customers.If our contract manufacturers are unable to deliver our products in the required amounts and in atimely fashion, we could experience delays or reductions in shipments to our customers which couldmaterially and adversely affect our revenues and our relationship with our customers.Unanticipated disruptions in our operations, slowdowns or shutdowns by our suppliers, manufacturersand shipping companies could adversely affect our ability to deliver our products and service ourcustomers which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our relationship with ourcustomers.     All of our products are manufactured in accordance with our specifications by factoriesprincipally located in China. If we are unable to obtain our products from these factories in therequired quantities and quality and in a timely fashion, we could experience delays or reductionsin product shipments to our customers which could negatively affect our ability to meet therequirements of our customers, as well as our relationships with our customers, which in turn couldmaterially and adversely affect our revenues and operating results.     Our ability to provide high quality customer service, process and fulfill orders and manageinventory depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our distribution centers and thetimely and uninterrupted performance of third party manufacturers and suppliers, shipping companiesand dock workers. Any material disruption, slowdown or shutdown of the operation of our callcenter, distribution centers, manufacturing facilities or management information systems, orcomparable disruptions, slowdowns or shutdowns suffered by our principal manufacturers, suppliersand shippers could cause delays in our ability to receive, process and fulfill customer orders andmay cause orders to be canceled, lost or delivered late, goods to be returned or receipt of goodsto be refused. As a result, our revenues and operating results could be materially and adverselyaffected.16      Substantially all of our suppliers are located in China. Inadequate development andmaintenance of infrastructure in China, including inadequate power and water supplies,transportation and raw materials availability, and the deterioration in the general political,economic and social environments in China may make it difficult, more expensive and possiblyprohibitive for these suppliers to continue to operate in China. During our fiscal year endedMarch 31, 2008, two of our suppliers (including one of our primary suppliers) located in Chinaclosed their facilities, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to find suitablereplacements for such suppliers. In addition, although we have implemented procedures to recertifyall of our existing and future suppliers and manufacturers of our products, there can be noassurance that our recertification procedures are adequate or that any of our recertified suppliersand manufacturers will not close their facilities. If we cannot find suitable replacements for anymanufacturers that have or may in the future close their facilities, our revenues and operatingresults could be materially and adversely affected.The failure to maintain our relationships with our licensees, licensors and distributors or thefailure to obtain new licensees, licensors or distribution relationships could materially andadversely affect our revenues and earnings.     We maintain agreements that allow licensees to use our Emerson® trademark for the manufactureand sale of specific consumer electronics and other products. In addition, we maintain agreementsfor the distribution of products bearing our brands, into defined geographic areas. Although wehave entered into agreements with certain of our licensees and distributorsof our products, most have terms of three years or less, including our agreement with Funai whichexpires in December 2010 unless renewed. We cannot assure that such agreements will be renewed orthat our relationships with our licensees or distributors will be maintained on satisfactory termsor at all. The failure to maintain our relationships with Funai and our other licensees anddistributors on terms satisfactory to us, the failure to obtain new licensees or distributionrelationships or the failure by our licensees to protect the integrity and reputation of ourEmerson® trademark could materially and adversely affect our licensing revenues and our earnings.     We also are parties to license agreements with Mattel pursuant to which we license the Barbieand HotWheels names, trademarks and logos. The license agreement pursuant to which we produce andsell a line of Barbie  Real Electronics expires in December 2009, and the license agreementpursuant to which we produce and sell a line of Hot Wheels products, expires in December 2010. Wemay not be able to maintain or extend such relationships which could adversely affect our revenuesand earnings.Our business could be materially and adversely affected if we cannot protect our intellectualproperty rights or if we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.     Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to maintain and protect ourproprietary rights. We own the Emerson® trademark, which is materially important to our business,as well as other trademarks, a patent, licenses and proprietary rights that are used for certain ofour home entertainment and consumer electronics products. Our trademarks are registered throughoutthe world, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, France, Spain, Germany, China, Japan, Indiaand the United Kingdom. We also have two patents in the United States on our SmartSet® technology,one of which expires in May 2020 and the other of which expires in April 2025. The laws of someforeign countries in which we operate may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent asdo17 laws in the United States. The protections afforded by the laws of such countries may not beadequate to protect our intellectual property rights.     Third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate, circumvent or render unenforceable anytrademarks, patents or proprietary rights owned by or licensed to us. In addition, in the eventthird party licensees fail to protect the integrity of our trademarks, the value of these markscould be materially and adversely affected. Our inability to protect our proprietary rights couldmaterially and adversely affect the license of our trade names, trademarks and patents to thirdparties as well as our ability to sell our products. Litigation may be necessary to enforce ourintellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets; and determine the scope and validity ofsuch intellectual property rights. Any such litigation, whether or not successful, could result insubstantial costs and diversion of resources and managements attention from the operation of ourbusiness. We believe that a third party currently is selling products that include our patentedSmartSet® technology. Accordingly, in July 2008, we demanded that such third party cease anddesist further sales of any and all products that include our patented technology. We cannotassure you, however, that such third party will discontinue its sales of such products inaccordance with our demand; that such third party will not seek to challenge our patents; or thatwe would prevail in any such challenge.     We may receive notices of claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights. Suchactions could result in litigation and we could incur significant costs and diversion of resourcesin defending such claims. The party making such claims could secure a judgment awardingsubstantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief. Such relief couldeffectively block our ability to make, use, sell, distribute or market our products and services insuch jurisdiction. We may also be required to seek licenses to such intellectual property. Wecannot predict, however, whether such licenses would be available or, if available, that suchlicenses could be obtained on terms that are commercially reasonable and acceptable to us. Thefailure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could delay or preclude the sale,manufacture or distribution of our products and could result in increased costs to us.Our revenues and earnings could be materially and adversely affected if we cannot anticipate markettrends or enhance existing products or achieve market acceptance of new products.     Our success is dependent on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer demandsand trends in a timely manner, as well as expanding into new markets and developing new products.In addition, to increase our penetration of current markets and gain footholds in new markets forour products, we must maintain our existing products and integrate them with new products. We maynot be successful in developing, marketing and releasing new products that respond to technologicaldevelopments or changing customer needs and preferences. We may also experience difficulties thatcould delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and sale of these new products.These new products may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and may not achieveany significant degree of market acceptance. If release dates of any future products orenhancements to our products are delayed, or if these products or enhancements fail to achievemarket acceptance when released, our sales volume may decline and earnings could be materially andadversely affected. In addition, new products or enhancements by our competitors may causecustomers to defer or forgo purchases of our products, which could also materially and adverselyaffect our revenues and earnings.18 Foreign regulations and changes in the political, public health and economic conditions in theforeign countries in which we operate our business could materially and adversely affect ourrevenues and earnings.     We derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales of products manufactured by thirdparties located primarily in China. In addition, third parties located in China and othercountries located in the same region produce and supply many of the components and raw materialsused in our products. Conducting an international business inherently involves a number ofdifficulties and risks that could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenuesand could subject us to increased costs. Among the factors that may adversely affect our revenuesand increase our costs are:  currency fluctuations which could cause an increase in the price of the componentsand raw materials used in our products and a decrease in our profits;   Chinese labor laws;   labor shortages in manufacturing facilities located in China, including theshort-term labor shortage in manufacturing facilities caused by migrant workers seekingemployment opportunities created by the 2008 Summer Olympics to be held in Beijing;   the elimination or reduction of value-added tax refunds to Chinese factories thatmanufacture products for export;   the rise of inflation and substantial economic growth in China;   more stringent export restrictions in the countries in which we operate which couldadversely affect our ability to deliver our products to our customers;   tariffs and other trade barriers which could make it more expensive for us to obtainand deliver our products to our customers;   political instability and economic downturns in these countries which couldadversely affect our ability to obtain our products from our manufacturers or deliverour products to our customers in a timely fashion;   seasonal reductions in business activity in these countries during the summer monthswhich could adversely affect our sales; and   new restrictions on the sale of electronic products containing certain hazardoussubstances.Any of factors described above may materially and adversely affect our revenues and/or increase ouroperating expenses. In fact, we recently have experienced, and may continue to experience, theconsequences of these risks taking place.19 The inability to use our tax net operating losses could result in a charge to earnings and couldrequire us to pay higher taxes.     We have substantial tax net operating losses available to reduce taxable income for federaland state income tax purposes. A portion of the benefit associated with the tax net operatinglosses has been recognized as a deferred tax asset in our financial statements and could be used toreduce our tax liability in future profitable periods. We believe these net deferred tax assetswill be realized through tax planning strategies available in future periods and future profitableoperating results. Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not thatmost of the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized prior to expiration, and we haveincreased our valuation allowance for the balance. The amount of the deferred tax asset consideredrealizable, however, could be reduced or eliminated in the near term if certain tax planningstrategies are not successfully executed, or estimates of future taxable income during thecarry-forward period is reduced.We are subject to intense competition in the industry in which we operate, which could causematerial reductions in the selling price of our products or losses of our market share.     The consumer electronics industry is highly competitive, especially with respect to pricingand the introduction of new products and features. Our products compete in the low tomedium-priced sector of the consumer electronics market and compete primarily on the basis ofreliability, brand recognition, quality, price, design, consumer acceptance of the Emerson®trademark and quality service and support to retailers and our customers. In recent years, we andmany of our competitors, have regularly lowered prices, and we expect these pricing pressures tocontinue. If these pricing pressures are not mitigated by increases in volume, cost reductionsfrom our suppliers or changes in product mix, our revenues and profits could be substantiallyreduced. As compared to us, many of our competitors have significantly greater managerial,financial, marketing, technical and other competitive resources and greater brand recognition. Asa result, our competitors may be able to (i) adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologiesand changes in customer requirements; (ii) devote greater resources to the promotion and sale oftheir products and services; and (iii) respond more effectively to pricing pressures.     In addition, competition could increase if new companies enter the market, existingcompetitors expand their product mix or we expand into new markets. An increase in competitioncould result in material price reductions or loss of our market share.The seasonality of our business, changes in consumer spending and economic conditions may cause ourquarterly operating results to fluctuate and cause our stock price to decline.     Our net revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, whichmay adversely affect our results of operations and the market price for our common stock. Factorsthat may cause these fluctuations include:  seasonal variations in operating results;   changes in market and economic conditions;20   the discretionary nature of consumers demands and spending patterns;   variations in the sales of our products to our significant customers;   increases in returned consumer electronics products in the March quarter whichfollows our peak September and December selling quarters;   variations in manufacturing and supplier relationships;   if we are unable to correctly anticipate and provide for inventory requirements fromquarter to quarter, we may not have sufficient inventory to deliver our products to ourcustomers in a timely fashion or we may have excess inventory that we are unable tosell;   new product developments or introductions;   product reviews and other media coverage;   competition, including competitive price pressures; and   political instability, war, acts of terrorism or other disasters.If our sales during the holiday season fall below our expectations, our operating results alsocould fall below expectations.     Sales of our products are somewhat seasonal due to consumer spending patterns, which tend toresult in significantly stronger sales in our September and December fiscal quarters, especially asa result of the holiday season. This pattern probably will not change significantly in the future.If the economy faltered in these periods, if our customers altered the timing or frequency oftheir promotional activities or if the effectiveness of these promotional activities declined,particularly around the holiday season, annual operating results could be materially adverselyeffected. Due to the seasonality of our business, our results for interim periods are notnecessarily indicative of our results for the year.If our third party sales representatives fail to adequately promote, market and sell our products,our revenues could significantly decrease.     A significant portion of our product sales are made through third party sales representativeorganizations, whose members are not our employees. Our level of sales depends on theeffectiveness of these organizations, as well as the effectiveness of our own employees. Some ofthese third party representatives may sell (and do sell), with our permission, competitive productsof third parties as well as our products. During our fiscal years ended March 31, 2008 and 2007,these organizations were responsible for approximately 57% and 50%, respectively, of our netrevenues during such periods. In addition, two of these representative organizations wereresponsible for a significant portion of these revenues. If any of our third party salesrepresentative organizations engaged by us, especially our two largest, fails to adequatelypromote, market and sell our products, our revenues could be significantly decreased until a replacement organization or distributor could beretained by21 us. Finding replacement organizations and distributors could be a time consumingprocess during which our revenues could be negatively impacted.We could be exposed to product liability or other claims for which our product liability or otherinsurance may be inadequate.     A failure of any of the products marketed by us may subject us to the risk of productliability claims and litigation arising from injuries allegedly caused by the improper functioningor design of our products. Although we currently maintain product liability insurance in amountswhich we consider adequate, we cannot assure that:  our insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities;   adequate product liability insurance will continue to be available in the future; or   our insurance can be maintained on acceptable terms.     Although we maintain liability insurance in amounts that we consider adequate, we cannotassure that such policies will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. To theextent product liability or other litigation losses are beyond the limits or scope of our insurancecoverage, our expenses could materially increase.A decline in thevalue of the auction rate securities included in our investmentscould materially adversely affect our liquidity.     Our investments include auction rate securities, with estimated fair value of $11.9 million atMarch 31, 2008. Auction rate securities are securities with short-term interest rate reset datesof generally less than ninety days but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess often years. At the end of each reset period, investors typically can sell at auction or continue tohold the securities. These securities are subject to fluctuations in fair value depending on thesupply and demand at each auction. Our auction rate securities consist of interests in pools ofstudent loan receivables issued by agencies established by counties, cities, states and othermunicipal entities. Liquidity for our auction rate securities typically is provided by an auctionprocess that resets the applicable interest rate every 7 to 35 days.     In early February 2008, our auction rate securities failed to sell at auction due to sellorders exceeding buy orders. Later in February and again in March 2008, we received approximately$1.1 million in partial calls of our auction rate securities. During 2008, the funds associatedwith our auction rate securities that have failed auction, may not be accessible until a successfulauction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, the security is called or theunderlying securities have matured. As a result of the recent instability in the market forauction rate securities, there may be a future decline in the value of our auction rate securities.A decline in the value of these securities that is not temporary could materially adversely affectour liquidity and income.We may seek to make acquisitions that prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our managementsattention and our capital resources.     We may seek to grow our business through the acquisition of related businesses. Suchacquisitions present risks that could materially adversely affect our earnings, including:22   the diversion of our managements attention from our everyday business activities;   the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired business;   the incurring of additional expenses related to such acquisitions, whether or notsuch acquisitions are consummated;   the contingent and latent risks associated with the past operations of, and otherunanticipated problems arising in, the acquired business; and   the need to expand management, administration and operational systems.If we make such acquisitions, we cannot predict whether:  we will be able to successfully integrate the operations of any new businesses intoour business;   we will realize any anticipated benefits of completed acquisitions; or   if there will be substantial unanticipated costs associated with acquisitions.In addition, future acquisitions by us may result in:  potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities;   the incurrence of additional debt; and   the recognition of significant charges for impairment and amortization expenserelated to goodwill and other intangible assets.We continuously evaluate potential acquisitions of related businesses. However, competition forsuch potential acquisitions is intense and we have not reached any agreement or arrangement withrespect to any particular acquisition and we may not be able to complete any acquisitions onfavorable terms or at all.Any substantial indebtedness we incur from time to time may adversely affect our ability to obtainadditional funds and may increase our vulnerability to economic or business downturns.     From time to time we may incur substantial debt in connection with our operations. As aresult, we may be subject to the risks associated with indebtedness, including:  because we would need to dedicate a portion of our cash flows from operations to paydebt service costs, we would have less funds available for operations and otherpurposes;   it may be more difficult and expensive to obtain additional funds throughfinancings, if such funds are available at all;23   we would be more vulnerable to economic downturns and fluctuations in interestrates, less able to withstand competitive pressures and less flexible in reacting tochanges in our industry and general economic conditions; and   if we were to default under any of our existing credit facilities or if ourcreditors were to demand payment of a portion or all of our indebtedness, we may nothave sufficient funds to make such payments.We have pledged substantially all of our assets to secure our borrowings under our creditfacilities and are subject to covenants that may restrict our ability to operate our business.     Our indebtedness under our credit facilities is secured by substantially all of our assets.If we default under the indebtedness secured by our assets, those assets would be available to thesecured creditor to satisfy our obligations to the secured creditor. In addition, our creditfacilities impose certain restrictive covenants, including financial, ownership, operational andnet worth covenants. Failure to satisfy any of these covenants could result in all or any of thefollowing:  acceleration of the payment of our outstanding indebtedness;   our inability to borrow additional amounts under our existing financingarrangements; and   our inability to secure financing on favorable terms or at all from alternativesources.Any of these consequences could significantly reduce the amount of cash and financing available tous which in turn would adversely affect our ability to operate our business, including acquiringour products from our manufacturers and distributing our products to our customers.Market Related RisksThe market price of our common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations fromtime to time.     The market price for our common stock and for securities of similar companies has from time totime experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. Factors which may affect our marketprice include:  market conditions in the industries in which we operate;   competition;   sales or the possibility of sales of our common stock;   our results of operations and financial condition; and   general economic conditions.24 Furthermore, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations unrelatedto the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also adverselyaffect the market price of our common stock.Grandes controlling interest in our common stock as well as our organizational documents andDelaware law make it difficult for us to be acquired without the consent and cooperation ofGrande, our board of directors and management.     Grandes controlling interest in our shares as well as several provisions of ourorganizational documents and Delaware law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt, including atakeover attempt in which the potential purchaser offers to pay a per share price greater than thecurrent market price of our common stock. Under the terms of our certificate of incorporation, ourboard of directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue sharesof preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges andrestrictions thereof. The ability to issue shares of preferred stock could tend to discouragetakeover or acquisition proposals not supported by our current board of directors.If our common stock is de-listed from the American Stock Exchange, shareholders liquidity in theirshares may be adversely affected and shareholders may have difficulty selling their shares orattaining a satisfactory price.     In order for our common stock to be eligible to continue to be listed on the American StockExchange, we must meet the current American Stock Exchange continued listing requirements,including satisfying the Audit Committee composition requirements and the timely filing of periodicreports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, because we are a controlledcompany under the rules of the American Stock Exchange, we are not required to comply with therules relating to independent directors, board nominations and executive compensation. Duringfiscal 2007, we failed to timely file our report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31,2006. We also have received notices from the American Stock Exchange in the past for failure tomeet certain continued listing requirements. If we are unable to continue to meet theserequirements, our common stock could be de-listed from the American Stock Exchange. If our commonstock were to be de-listed from the American Stock Exchange, our common stock could continue totrade on the National Association of Securities Dealers over-the-counter bulletin board or on thePink Sheets, as the case may be. Any such de-listing of our common stock could have an adverseeffect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for our common stock, interms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price and through delays inthe timing of transactions and less coverage of us by securities analysts, if any. It also couldhave an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital in the public or private equity markets if we were to determine that we need to seek additional equitycapital in the future.25 Forward-Looking Information     This report contains forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions ofthe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 under Section 27A of the Securities Act of1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.Forward-looking statements include statements with respect to our beliefs, plans, objectives,goals, expectations, anticipations, assumptions, estimates, intentions, and future performance, andinvolve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may be beyond our control,and which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different fromfuture results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-lookingstatements.

3,MSN,EMERSON RADIO CORP,2007-06-29,">Item 1A. Business Related RisksThe majority ownership of our common stock by subsidiaries of The Grande Holdings Limited, a HongKong based group of companies, substantially reduces the influence of our other stockholders.12Table of Contents     As noted previously, The Grande Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries own approximately 50.8%of our outstanding common stock as of June 27, 2007. As a result, Grande currently has the abilityto influence significantly the actions that require stockholder approval, including:  the election of our directors; and   the approval of mergers, sales of assets or other corporate transactions or matterssubmitted for stockholder approval.     As a result, our other stockholders may have little or no influence over matters submitted forstockholder approval.Because of our relationships with Grande, including our related party transactions, we may becomesubject to conflicts of interests that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business.     Our Chairman of the Board, Christopher Ho, serves as the Chairman of Grande, and our ChiefExecutive Officer, Adrian Ma, serves as the Chief Executive Officer and a director of Grande. Inaddition, Michael A.B. Binney, our President  International Sales, serves as Executive Director ofGrande. These relationships could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interestwhen members of our senior management are faced with decisions that could have differentimplications for us and Grande or its affiliates. In addition, as described in Note 3 of ourfinancial statements and Item 9A  Control Procedures, there are a number of related partytransactions between us and Grande or affiliates of Grande. Potential conflicts of interest canexist if a related party director or officer has to make a decision that has different implicationsfor us and the related party. No assurance can be given as to how potentially conflicted boardmembers or officers will evaluate their fiduciary duties to us and Grande, respectively, or howsuch individuals will act under such circumstances. Furthermore, the appearance of conflicts, evenif such conflicts do not materialize, might adversely affect the publics perception of Emerson, aswell as our relationship with our existing customers, licensors and licensees and our ability toenter into new relationships in the future.     As a result of the related party transactions entered into between us and affiliates of Grandedescribed in Note 3 to our financial statements, our lender deemed us to be in breach of certaincovenants contained in our credit facility, including a covenant restricting us from lending moneyand from entering into related party transactions without the consent of its lender. Our lenderunder the credit facility agreed to waive such breaches and we and the lender entered into anamendment to the credit facility. Under the amendment, (i) we were required to grant the lender asecurity interest in the $23 million Note and the Guaranty referred to in Note 3 to our financialstatements, (ii) a failure (following a 15 day cure period) by the borrowers to make payments to usas required by the terms of the Note, described in Note 3 to the financial statements would havebeen deemed a default under the credit facility, (iii) the number of field audits by the lenderwill be increased from two to three each year and (iv) we were required to pay $125,000 to thelender in connection with the amendment.The loss or significant reduction in business of any of our key customers, including Wal-Mart,Target, and Kmart could materially and adversely affect our revenues and earnings.13Table of Contents     We are highly dependent upon sales of our products to certain of our customers, includingWal-Mart, Target and Kmart. During our fiscal years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006, Wal-Martstores accounted for approximately 30% and 37%, respectively, Target stores accounted forapproximately 21% and 17%, respectively, and Kmart stores accounted for approximately 6% and 10%,respectively, of our net revenues. Except for non-recurring promotional item sales to ESIInternational in fiscal 2007, which were 12% of net revenues, no other customer accounted forgreater than 10% of our net revenues during these periods, other customers may account for morethan 10% of our net revenues in future periods. All purchases of our products by customers aremade through purchase orders and we do not have any long-term contracts with any of our customers.The loss of Wal-Mart, Target or Kmart, or any of our other customers to which we sell a significantamount of our products or any significant portion of orders from Wal-Mart, Target or Kmart, or suchother customers or any material adverse change in the financial condition of such customers couldnegatively affect our revenues and decrease our earnings.The failure to maintain our relationships with our licensees, licensors and distributors or thefailure to obtain new licensees, licensors or distribution relationships could materially andadversely affect our revenues and earnings.     We maintain agreements that allow licensees to use our Emerson® and H.H. Scott® trademarks for themanufacture and sale of specific consumer electronics and other products. In addition, we maintainagreements for the distribution of products bearing our brands, into defined geographic areas.Although we have entered into agreements with certain of our licensees and distributors of ourproducts, most of which have a term of three years or less all of which will expire by September2021, including our agreement with Funai, we cannot assure that such agreements will be renewedwhen the terms of such agreements expire, or that our relationships with our licensees ordistributors will be maintained on satisfactory terms or at all. In addition, during our fiscalyears ended March 31, 2006, and 2007, we recognized a significant decrease in licensing revenuesunder our agreement with Funai. The failure to maintain our relationships with Funai and our otherlicensees and distributors on terms satisfactory to us, the failure to obtain new licensees ordistribution relationships or the failure by our licensees to protect the integrity and reputationof our Emerson® and H.H. Scott® trademarks could materially and adversely affect our licensingrevenues and our earnings. We also maintain a license agreement with Apple Computer Inc. todevelop and market products that are compatible with iPod® audio and video devices. This licensehas been renewed through June of 2008. License agreements with MTV Networks to license theNickelodeon name, trademark and logo, along with several of Nickelodeons trademarks and logos,were not renewed, though we have, as of December 2006 entered into an inward license agreement withMattel to license the Barbie name, trademark and logo. The license agreement expires December2009. Under the license agreement Emerson will produce and sell a line of Barbie  RealElectronics. We may not be able to maintain or extend such relationships which could materiallyand adversely affect our revenues and earnings.Our revenues and earnings could be materially and adversely affected if we cannot anticipate markettrends or enhance existing products or achieve market acceptance of new products.     Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully anticipate and respond to changingconsumer demands and trends in a timely manner, as well as expanding into new markets anddeveloping new products. In addition, to increase our penetration of current markets and gainfootholds in new markets for our products, we must maintain our existing products and integratethem14Table of Contentswith new products. We may not be successful in developing, marketing and releasing newproducts that respond to technological developments or changing customer needs and preferences. Wemay also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development,introduction and sale of these new products. In addition, these new products may not adequatelymeet the requirements of the marketplace and may not achieve any significant degree of marketacceptance. If release dates of any future products or enhancements to our products are delayed,or if these products or enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance when released, our salesvolume may decline and earnings could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, newproducts or enhancements by our competitors may cause customers to defer or forgo purchases of ourproducts, which could also materially and adversely affect our revenues and earnings.We depend on a limited number of suppliers for our products. The availability to secure ourproducts could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our relationship with our customers.     We rely on a limited number of suppliers for our component parts and raw materials, most ofwhich are located outside of the United States. Although there are many suppliers for each of ourcomponent parts and raw materials, we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for many ofthe significant components and raw materials. This reliance involves a number of significantpotential risks, including:  lack of availability of materials and interruptions in delivery of components andraw materials from our suppliers;   manufacturing delays caused by such lack of availability or interruptions indelivery;   fluctuations in the quality and the price of components and raw materials, inparticular due to the petroleum price impact on such materials; and   risks related to foreign operations.     We generally do not have any long-term or exclusive purchase commitments with any of oursuppliers. Midea, Capetronic Displays, and Lasco Industries are our largest suppliers ofcomponents for our products, each of which accounted for more than 10% of our purchases ofcomponents for our products for our latest fiscal year. Our failure to maintain existingrelationships with our suppliers or to establish new relationships in the future could alsonegatively affect our ability to obtain our components and raw materials used in our products in atimely manner. If we are unable to obtain ample supply of product from our existing suppliers oralternative sources of supply, we may be unable to satisfy our customers orders which couldmaterially and adversely affect our revenues and our relationship with our customers.If our original equipment manufacturers are unable to deliver our products in the required amountsand in a timely fashion, we could experience delays or reductions in shipments to our customerswhich could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our relationship with our customers.     All of our products are manufactured in accordance with our specifications by originalequipment manufacturers principally located in China.15Table of Contents     If we are unable to obtain our products from the original equipment manufacturers located inChina in the required quantities and quality and in a timely fashion, we could experience delays orreductions in product shipments to our customers which could negatively affect our ability to meetthe requirements of our customers, as well as our relationships with our customers, which in turncould materially and adversely affect our revenues and operating results.Unanticipated disruptions in our operations or slowdowns by our suppliers, manufacturers andshipping companies could adversely affect our ability to deliver our products and service ourcustomers which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our relationship with ourcustomers.     Our ability to provide high quality customer service, process and fulfill orders and manageinventory depends on:  the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our call center and distributioncenters; and   the timely and uninterrupted performance of third party manufacturers and suppliers,shipping companies, and dock workers.     Any material disruption or slowdown in the operation of our call center, distribution centers,manufacturing facilities or management information systems, or comparable disruptions or slowdownssuffered by our principal manufacturers, suppliers and shippers could cause delays in our abilityto receive, process and fulfill customer orders and may cause orders to be canceled, lost ordelivered late, goods to be returned or receipt of goods to be refused. As a result, our revenuesand operating results could be materially and adversely affected.Our revenues and earnings could be materially and adversely affected by foreign regulations andchanges in the political, public health and economic conditions in the foreign countries in whichwe operate our business.     We derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales of products manufactured by thirdparties located primarily in China. In addition, third parties located in China and othercountries located in the same region produce and supply many of the components and raw materialsused in our products. Conducting an international business inherently involves a number ofdifficulties and risks that could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenuesand could subject us to increased costs. The main factors that may adversely affect our revenuesand increase our costs are:  currency fluctuations which could cause an increase in the price of the componentsand raw materials used in our products and a decrease in our profits;   more stringent export restrictions in the countries in which we operate which couldadversely affect our ability to deliver our products to our customers;   tariffs and other trade barriers which could make it more expensive for us to obtainand deliver our products to our customers;16Table of Contents  political instability and economic downturns in these countries which couldadversely affect our ability to obtain our products from our manufacturers or deliverour products to our customers in a timely fashion;   seasonal reductions in business activity in these countries during the summer monthswhich could adversely affect our sales; and   new restrictions on the sale of electronic products containing certain hazardoussubstances.     We have experienced, and may in the future experience, many of these risks and cannot predictthe impact of any particular risk on our operations. However, any of these factors may materiallyand adversely affect our revenues and/or increase our operating expenses.The seasonality of our business, as well as changes in consumer spending and economic conditions,may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate and cause our stock price to decline.     Our net revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Themain factors that may cause these fluctuations are:  seasonal variations in operating results;   variations in the sales of our products to our significant customers;   increases in returned consumer electronics products in the March quarter whichfollows our peak September and December selling quarters;   variations in manufacturing and supplier relationships;   if we are unable to correctly anticipate and provide for inventory requirementsfrom quarter to quarter, we may not have sufficient inventory to deliver our productsto our customers in a timely fashion or we may have excess inventory that we are unableto sell;   the discretionary nature of our customers demands and spending patterns;   changes in market and economic conditions; and   competition.     In addition, our quarterly operating results could be materially adversely affected bypolitical instability, war, acts of terrorism or other disasters.     Sales of our products are somewhat seasonal due to consumer spending patterns, which tend toresult in significantly stronger sales in our September and December fiscal quarters, especially asa result of the holiday season. This pattern will probably not change significantly in the future.Although we believe that the seasonality of our business is based primarily on the timing ofconsumer demand for our products, fluctuations in operating results can also result from otherfactors affecting17Table of Contentsus and our competitors, including new product developments or introductions, availability ofproducts for resale, competitive pricing pressures, changes in product mix, pricing and productreviews and other media coverage. Due to the seasonality of our business, our results for interimperiods are not necessarily indicative of our results for the year.     Our sales and earnings can also be affected by changes in the general economy since purchasesof consumer electronics are generally discretionary for consumers. Our success is influenced by anumber of economic factors which affect disposable consumer income, such as employment levels,business conditions, interest rates, oil and gas prices and taxation rates. Adverse changes inthese economic factors, among others, may restrict consumer spending, thereby negatively affectingour sales and profitability.     As a result of these and other factors, revenues for any quarter are subject to significantvariation, which may adversely affect our results of operations and the market price for our commonstock.If our third party sales representatives fail to adequately promote, market and sell our products,our revenues could significantly decrease.     A significant portion of our product sales are made through third party sales representativeorganizations, whose members are not our employees. Our level of sales depends on theeffectiveness of these organizations, as well as the effectiveness of our own employees. Some ofthese third party representatives may sell (and do sell), with our permission, competitive productsof third parties as well as our products. During our fiscal years ended March 31, 2007 and 2006,these organizations were responsible for approximately 50% and 55%, respectively, of our netrevenues during such periods. In addition, two of these representative organizations wereresponsible for a significant portion of these revenues. If any of our third party salesrepresentative organizations engaged by us, especially our two largest, fails to adequatelypromote, market and sell our products, our revenues could be significantly decreased until areplacement organization or distributor could be retained by us. Finding replacement organizationsand distributors could be a time consuming process during which our revenues could be negativelyimpacted.We may seek to make acquisitions that prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our managementsattention and our capital resources.     We may seek to grow our business through the acquisition of related businesses. Suchacquisitions present risks that could materially adversely affect our earnings, including:  the diversion of our managements attention from our everyday business activities;   the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired business;   the incurring of additional expenses related to such acquisitions, whether or notsuch acquisitions are consummated;   the contingent and latent risks associated with the past operations of, and otherunanticipated problems arising in, the acquired business; and18Table of Contents  the need to expand management, administration and operational systems.If we make such acquisitions, we cannot predict whether:  we will be able to successfully integrate the operations of any new businesses intoour business;   we will realize any anticipated benefits of completed acquisitions; or   if there will be substantial unanticipated costs associated with acquisitions.In addition, future acquisitions by us may result in:  potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities;   the incurrence of additional debt; and   the recognition of significant charges for impairment and amortization expenserelated to goodwill and other intangible assets.We continuously evaluate potential acquisitions of related businesses. However, competition forsuch potential acquisitions is intense and we have not reached any agreement or arrangement withrespect to any particular acquisition and we may not be able to complete any acquisitions onfavorable terms or at all.We are subject to intense competition in the industry in which we operate, which could causematerial reductions in the selling price of our products or losses of our market share.     The consumer electronics industry is highly competitive, especially with respect to pricingand the introduction of new products and features. Our products compete in the low tomedium-priced sector of the consumer electronics market and compete primarily on the basis of:  reliability;   brand recognition;   quality;   price;   design;   consumer acceptance of the Emerson® trademark; and   quality service and support to retailers and our customers.19Table of Contents     In recent years, we and many of our competitors, have regularly lowered prices, and we expectthese pricing pressures to continue. If these pricing pressures are not mitigated by increases involume, cost reductions from our supplier or changes in product mix, our revenues and profits couldbe substantially reduced. As compared to us, many of our competitors have:  significantly longer operating histories;   significantly greater managerial, financial, marketing, technical and othercompetitive resources; and   greater brand recognition.     As a result, our competitors may be able to:  adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customerrequirements;   devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services;and   respond more effectively to pricing pressures.     These factors could materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Inaddition, competition could increase if:  new companies enter the market;   existing competitors expand their product mix; or   we expand into new markets.     An increase in competition could result in material price reductions or loss of our marketshare.Our business could be materially adversely affected if we cannot protect our intellectual propertyrights or if we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.     Our ability to compete effectively will depend on our ability to maintain and protect ourproprietary rights. We own the Emerson® trademark, which is materially important to our business,as well as our licenses, other trademarks and proprietary rights that are used for certain of ourhome entertainment and consumer electronics products. Our trademarks are registered throughout theworld, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, France, Spain, Germany, China, Japan, India andthe United Kingdom. However, third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate, circumvent or renderunenforceable any proprietary rights owned by or licensed to us. In addition, in the event thirdparty licensees fail to protect the integrity of our trademarks, the value of these marks could bematerially adversely affected.20Table of Contents     The laws of some foreign countries in which we operate may not protect our proprietary rightsto the same extent as do laws in the United States. The protections afforded by the laws of suchcountries may not be adequate to protect our intellectual property rights.     Our inability to protect our proprietary rights could materially adversely affect the licenseof our trade names and trademarks to third parties as well as our ability to sell our products.Litigation may be necessary to:  enforce our intellectual property rights;   protect our trade secrets; and   determine the scope and validity of such intellectual property rights.     Any such litigation, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs anddiversion of resources and managements attention from the operation of our business.     We may receive notice of claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights. Suchactions could result in litigation and we could incur significant costs and diversion of resourcesin defending such claims. The party making such claims could secure a judgment awardingsubstantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief. Such relief couldeffectively block our ability to make, use, sell, distribute or market our products and services insuch jurisdiction. We may also be required to seek licenses to such intellectual property. Wecannot predict, however, whether such licenses would be available or, if available, that suchlicenses could be obtained on terms that are commercially reasonable and acceptable to us. Thefailure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could delay or preclude the sale,manufacture or distribution of our products and could result in increased costs to us.We could be exposed to product liability or other claims for which our product liability or otherinsurance may be inadequate.     A failure of any of the products marketed by us may subject us to the risk of productliability claims and litigation arising from injuries allegedly caused by the improper functioningor design of our products. Although we currently maintain product liability insurance in amountswhich we consider adequate, we cannot assure that:  our insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities;   adequate product liability insurance will continue to be available in the future; or   our insurance can be maintained on acceptable terms.     Although we maintain liability insurance in amounts that we consider adequate, we cannotassure that such policies will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. To theextent product liability or other litigation losses are beyond the limits or scope of our insurancecoverage, our expenses could materially increase.21Table of ContentsThe inability to use our tax net operating losses could result in a charge to earnings and couldrequire us to pay higher taxes.     We have substantial tax net operating losses available to reduce taxable income for federaland state income tax purposes. A portion of the benefit associated with the tax net operatinglosses has been recognized as a deferred tax asset in our financial statements and could be used toreduce our tax liability in future profitable periods. We believe these net deferred tax assetswill be realized through tax planning strategies available in future periods and future profitableoperating results. Although realization is not assured, we believe it is more likely than not thatall of the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of the deferred taxasset considered realizable, however, could be reduced or eliminated in the near term if certaintax planning strategies are not successfully executed, or estimates of future taxable income duringthe carry-forward period is reduced.     Our indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional funds and may increase ourvulnerability to economic or business downturns.     From time to time we incur substantial debt in connection with our operations. As a result,we may be subject to the risks associated with indebtedness, including:  we must dedicate a portion of our cash flows from operations to pay debt servicecosts and, as a result, we have less funds available for operations and other purposes;   it may be more difficult and expensive to obtain additional funds throughfinancings, if such funds are available at all;   we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and fluctuations in interest rates,less able to withstand competitive pressures and less flexible in reacting to changesin our industry and general economic conditions; and   if we default under any of our existing credit facilities or if our creditors demandpayment of a portion or all of our indebtedness, we may not have sufficient funds tomake such payments.We have pledged substantially all of our assets to secure our borrowings under our creditfacilities and are subject to covenants that may restrict our ability to operate our business.     Our indebtedness under our credit facilities is secured by substantially all of our assets.If we default under the indebtedness secured by our assets, those assets would be available to thesecured creditor to satisfy our obligations to the secured creditor. In addition, our creditfacilities impose certain restrictive covenants, including financial, ownership, operational andnet worth covenants. Failure to satisfy any of these covenants could result in all or any of thefollowing:  acceleration of the payment of our outstanding indebtedness;   our inability to borrow additional amounts under our existing financingarrangements; and   our inability to secure financing on favorable terms or at all from alternativesources.22Table of Contents     Any of these consequences could significantly reduce the amount of cash and financingavailable to us which in turn would adversely affect our ability to operate our business, includingacquiring our products from our manufacturers and distributing our products to our customers.We had identified material weaknesses in our internal controls and, while new internal controlpolicies and procedures have been installed, if we are unable to maintain appropriate internalcontrols and procedures, it could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, result in therestatement of its financial statements, harm our operating results, limit our access to creditfacilities necessary to fund our operations, subject us to regulatory scrutiny and sanction, causeinvestors to lose confidence in the our reported financial information and have a negative effecton the market price for shares of our common stock.     Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. Wemaintain a system of internal controls over financial reporting, which is defined as a processdesigned by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financialofficer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our board of directors,management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability offinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordancewith generally accepted accounting principles.     As noted in Item 9A  Controls and Procedures, certain events in fiscal 2007 revealedmaterial weaknesses in our internal controls. We will be required to document and test ourinternal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of theSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which will require annual management assessments of the effectivenessof our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by the our independent registeredpublic accounting firm addressing these assessments. The process of designing and implementingeffective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react tochanges in our business and management and the economic and regulatory environments and to expendsignificant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy ourreporting obligations as a public company.     Our Audit Committee has assigned the highest priority to the improvement of our internalcontrols over financial reporting and has taken, and will continue to take, action in furtheranceof such improvement and in response to the events described under Item 9A  Controls andProcedures. We cannot assure you that such remediation efforts will be effective to prevent eventsor actions which are inconsistent with our internal controls or that it will not, in the future,identify further areas requiring improvement in our internal control over financial reporting orthat our internal controls will not be circumvented.     If we are unable to establish appropriate internal financial reporting controls and proceduresor if such controls and procedures are not complied with, it could cause us to fail to meet ourreporting obligations, result in the restatement of our financial statements, harm our operatingresults, limit our access to credit facilities necessary to fund our operations, subject us toregulatory scrutiny and sanction, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financialinformation and have a negative effect on the market price for shares of our common stock. Asnoted in Note 3 to our financial statements contained herein, the Audit Committee is conducting anindependent review of the transactions discussed therein. The review may uncover additional23Table of Contentsfacts concerning these transactions, additional related party transactions, or additionaldeficiencies in our system of internal controls over financial reporting.Market Related RisksThe market price of our common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations fromtime to time.     The market price for our common stock and for securities of similar companies has from time totime experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. Factors which may affect our marketprice include:  market conditions in the industries in which we operate;   competition;   sales or the possibility of sales of our common stock;   our results of operations and financial condition; and   general economic conditions.     Furthermore, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuationsunrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may alsoadversely affect the market price of our common stock.Our organizational documents and Delaware law may make it harder for us to be acquired withoutthe consent and cooperation of our board of directors and management.     Several provisions of our organizational documents and Delaware law may deter or prevent atakeover attempt, including a takeover attempt in which the potential purchaser offers to pay a pershare price greater than the current market price of our common stock. Under the terms of ourcertificate of incorporation, our board of directors has the authority, without further action bythe stockholders, to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights,preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof. The ability to issue shares of preferred stockcould tend to discourage takeover or acquisition proposals not supported by our current board ofdirectors.If our common stock is de-listed from the American Stock Exchange, shareholders may not be able toresell their shares at or above the price at which the shares were purchased, or at all.     In order for our common stock to continue to be listed on the American Stock Exchange, we mustmeet the current American Stock Exchange continued listing requirements, including, among otherthings, satisfying the audit committee composition requirements and meeting our filing requirementswith the SEC. In addition, we are a controlled company under the rules of the American StockExchange and are not required to comply with the rules relating to independent directors, boardnominations and executive compensation. During fiscal 2007, we failed to timely file our report onForm 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2006. In addition, we have received notices from theAmerican Stock Exchange in the past for failure to24Table of Contentsmeet certain continued listing requirements. If we are unable to continue to meet theserequirements, our common stock could be de-listed from the American Stock Exchange. If our commonstock were to be de-listed from the American Stock Exchange, our common stock could continue totrade on the National Association of Securities Dealers over-the-counter bulletin board or on thePink Sheets, as the case may be. Any such de-listing of our common stock could have an adverseeffect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for our common stock, notonly in terms of the number of shares that can be bought and sold at a given price, but alsothrough delays in the timing of transactions and less coverage of us by securities analysts, ifany. Also, if in the future we were to determine that we need to seek additional equity capital,it could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital in the public or private equitymarkets.Forward-Looking Information     This report contains forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions ofthe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 under Section 27A of the Securities Act of1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.     Forward-looking statements include statements with respect to our beliefs, plans, objectives,goals, expectations, anticipations, assumptions, estimates, intentions, and future performance, andinvolve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may be beyond our control,and which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different fromfuture results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-lookingstatements.     All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could beforward-looking statements.

1,MSN,EMERSON RADIO CORP,2006-07-17,"ITEM 1A. BUSINESS RELATED RISKSTHERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE COMPOSITION OF OUR BOARD OFDIRECTORS, SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM AND OUTSIDE ADVISORS. THE CHANGES COULD AFFECTOUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR EXISTING CUSTOMERS, LICENSORS AND LICENSEES, AND OURABILITY TO ENTER INTO NEW RELATIONSHIPS IN THE FUTURE.          As disclosed under ""Business - Board of Directors, Management andAdvisors,"" there has been significant changes in our board of directors, seniormanagement team and outside advisors. Although many of our new directors andsenior management personnel have significant experience in the consumerelectronics industry, these individuals have less familiarity with Emerson thandid their predecessors.                                       13          Certain of our executive officers have obligations elsewhere and onlywill be able to devote a portion of their time to our business. For example, Mr.Ma also currently serves as the chief executive officer and a director ofGrande.          These significant changes in our management team, board of directorsand outside advisors could affect our relationships with our existing customers,licensors and licensees and our ability to enter into new relationships in thefuture.THE SUBSTANTIAL OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK BY A SUBSIDIARY OF THE GRANDEHOLDINGS LIMITED, A HONG KONG BASED GROUP OF COMPANIES, SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCESTHE INFLUENCE OF OUR OTHER STOCKHOLDERS.          As noted previously, The Grande Holdings Limited and it's subsidiariesowns approximately 46% of our outstanding common stock as of June 30, 2006. As aresult, Grande currently has the ability to influence significantly the actionsthat require stockholder approval, including:          o    the election of our directors; and          o    the approval of mergers, sales of assets or other corporate               transactions or matters submitted for stockholder approval.          As a result, our other stockholders may have little or no influenceover matters submitted for stockholder approval.THE LOSS, OR SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN BUSINESS OF ANY OF OUR KEY CUSTOMERS,INCLUDING WAL-MART, TARGET, AND KMART COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OURREVENUES AND EARNINGS.          We are highly dependent upon sales of our products to certain of ourcustomers, including Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart. During our fiscal years endedMarch 31, 2006 and 2005, Wal-Mart stores accounted for approximately 37% and41%, respectively, Target stores accounted for approximately 17% and 16%,respectively, and Kmart stores accounted for approximately 10% and 9%,respectively, of our net revenues. Although no other customer accounted forgreater than 10% of our net revenues during these periods, other customers mayaccount for more than 10% of our net revenues in future periods. All purchasesof our products by customers are made through purchase orders and we do not haveany long-term contracts with any of our customers. The loss of Wal-Mart, Targetor Kmart, or any of our other customers to which we sell a significant amount ofour products or any significant portion of orders from Wal-Mart, Target orKmart, or such other customers or any material adverse change in the financialcondition of such customers could negatively affect our revenues and decreaseour earnings.                                       14THE FAILURE TO MAINTAIN OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR LICENSEES, LICENSORS ANDDISTRIBUTORS OR THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN NEW LICENSEES, LICENSORS OR DISTRIBUTIONRELATIONSHIPS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS.          We maintain license agreements that allow licensees to use ourEmerson(R) and H.H. Scott(R) trademarks for the manufacture and sale of consumerelectronics and other products. In addition, we maintain distribution agreementsfor the distribution of our products into defined geographic areas. Although wehave entered into agreements with certain of our licensees and distributors ofour products, most of which have a term of three years or less and will expireby December 2010, including our agreement with Funai, we cannot assure that suchagreements will be renewed when the terms of such agreements expire, or that ourrelationships with our licensees or distributors will be maintained onsatisfactory terms or at all. In addition, during our fiscal year ended March31, 2006, we recognized a significant decrease in licensing revenues under ouragreement with Funai. The failure to maintain our relationships with Funai andour other licensees and distributors on terms satisfactory to us, the failure toobtain new licensees or distribution relationships or the failure by ourlicensees to protect the integrity and reputation of our Emerson(R) and H.H.Scott(R) trademarks could materially and adversely affect our licensing revenuesand our earnings. We also maintain a license agreement with Apple Computer Inc.to develop and market products that are compatible with the iPod(R) audio andvideo devices. This license is set to expire in June 2007. In addition, wemaintain multiple license agreements with MTV Networks to license theNickelodeon name, trademark and logo, along with several of Nickelodeon'strademarks and logos, each of which expire in December 2006. We may not be ableto renew the license on terms favorable to us or at all. The failure to maintainour relationship with MTV Networks or other licensors could materially andadversely affect our revenues and our earningsOUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WECANNOT ANTICIPATE MARKET TRENDS OR ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS OR ACHIEVE MARKETACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS.          Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully anticipate andrespond to changing consumer demands and trends in a timely manner, as well asexpanding into new markets and developing new products. In addition, to increaseour penetration of current markets and gain footholds in new markets for ourproducts, we must maintain our existing products and integrate them with newproducts. We may not be successful in developing, marketing and releasing newproducts that respond to technological developments or changing customer needsand preferences. We may also experience difficulties that could delay or preventthe successful development, introduction and sale of these new products. Inaddition, these new products may not adequately meet the requirements of themarketplace and may not achieve any significant degree of market acceptance. Ifrelease dates of any future products or enhancements to our products aredelayed, or if these products or enhancements fail to achieve market acceptancewhen released, our sales volume may decline and earnings could be materially andadversely affected. In addition, new products or enhancements by our competitorsmay cause customers to defer or forgo purchases of our products, which couldalso materially and adversely affect our revenues and earnings.                                       15WE DEPEND ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS. THE AVAILABILITY TOSECURE OUR PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OURRELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CUSTOMERS.          We rely on a limited number of suppliers for our component parts andraw materials, most of which are located outside of the United States. Althoughthere are many suppliers for each of our component parts and raw materials, weare dependent on a limited number of suppliers for many of the significantcomponents and raw materials. This reliance involves a number of significantpotential risks, including:          o    lack of availability of materials and interruptions in delivery               of components and raw materials from our suppliers;          o    manufacturing delays caused by such lack of availability or               interruptions in delivery;          o    fluctuations in the quality and the price of components and raw               materials, in particular due to the petroleum price impact on               such materials; and          o    risks related to foreign operations.          We do not have any long-term or exclusive purchase commitments withany of our suppliers. Midea, StarLite, Oxygen, and Lasco Industries are ourlargest suppliers of components for our products, each of which accounted formore than 10% of our purchases of components for our products for our latestfiscal year. Our failure to maintain existing relationships with our suppliersor to establish new relationships in the future could also negatively affect ourability to obtain our components and raw materials used in our products in atimely manner. If we are unable to obtain ample supply of product from ourexisting suppliers or alternative sources of supply, we may be unable to satisfyour customers' orders which could materially and adversely affect our revenuesand our relationship with our customers.IF OUR ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS ARE UNABLE TO DELIVER OUR PRODUCTS INTHE REQUIRED AMOUNTS AND IN A TIMELY FASHION, WE COULD EXPERIENCE DELAYS ORREDUCTIONS IN SHIPMENTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELYAFFECT OUR REVENUES AND OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CUSTOMERS.          All of our products are manufactured in accordance with ourspecifications by original equipment manufacturers principally located in China.          If we are unable to obtain our products from the original equipmentmanufacturers located in China in the required quantities and quality and in atimely fashion, we could experience delays or reductions in product shipments toour customers which could negatively affect our ability to meet the requirementsof our customers, as well as our relationships with our customers, which in turncould materially and adversely affect our revenues and operating results.                                       16UNANTICIPATED DISRUPTIONS IN OUR OPERATIONS OR SLOWDOWNS BY OUR SUPPLIERS,MANUFACTURERS AND SHIPPING COMPANIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TODELIVER OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICE OUR CUSTOMERS WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ANDADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CUSTOMERS.          Our ability to provide high quality customer service, process andfulfill orders and manage inventory depends on:          o    the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our call center and               distribution center; and          o    the timely and uninterrupted performance of third party               manufacturers and suppliers, shipping companies, and dock               workers.          Any material disruption or slowdown in the operation of our callcenter, distribution center, manufacturing facilities or management informationsystems, or comparable disruptions or slowdowns suffered by our principalmanufacturers, suppliers and shippers could cause delays in our ability toreceive, process and fulfill customer orders and may cause orders to becanceled, lost or delivered late, goods to be returned or receipt of goods to berefused. As a result, our revenues and operating results could be materially andadversely affected.OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGNREGULATIONS AND CHANGES IN THE POLITICAL, PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONSIN THE FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE OUR BUSINESS.          We derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales of productsmanufactured by third parties located primarily in China. In addition, thirdparties located in China and other countries located in the same region produceand supply many of the components and raw materials used in our products.Conducting an international business inherently involves a number ofdifficulties and risks that could materially and adversely affect our ability togenerate revenues and could subject us to increased costs. The main factors thatmay adversely affect our revenues and increase our costs are:          o    currency fluctuations which could cause an increase in the price               of the components and raw materials used in our products and a               decrease in our profits;          o    more stringent export restrictions in the countries in which we               operate which could adversely affect our ability to deliver our               products to our customers;          o    tariffs and other trade barriers which could make it more               expensive for us to obtain and deliver our products to our               customers;          o    political instability and economic downturns in these countries               which could adversely affect our ability to obtain our products               from our manufacturers or deliver our products to our customers               in a timely fashion;          o    seasonal reductions in business activity in these countries               during the summer months which could adversely affect our sales;               and                                       17          o    new restrictions on the sale of electronic products in European               Union countries containing certain hazardous substances.          The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in prior years had aparticularly strong impact in China, Hong Kong and Singapore and negativelyeffected our operations. If there was a similar outbreak in the future, ouroperations, including our ability to obtain our products in a timely fashion, orthe operation of our suppliers, manufacturers and shipping companies could beadversely affected which may adversely affect our earnings.          We have experienced, and may in the future experience, many of theserisks and cannot predict the impact of any particular risk on our operations.However, any of these factors may materially and adversely affect our revenuesand/or increase our operating expenses.THE SEASONALITY OF OUR BUSINESS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN CONSUMER SPENDING ANDECONOMIC CONDITIONS, MAY CAUSE OUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS TO FLUCTUATE ANDCAUSE OUR STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE.          Our net revenue and operating results may vary significantly fromquarter to quarter. The main factors that may cause these fluctuations are:          o    seasonal variations in operating results;          o    variations in the sales of our products to our significant               customers;          o    increases in returned consumer electronics products in the March               quarter which follows our peak September and December selling               quarters;          o    variations in manufacturing and supplier relationships;          o    if we are unable to correctly anticipate and provide for               inventory requirements from quarter to quarter, we may not have               sufficient inventory to deliver our products to our customers in               a timely fashion or we may have excess inventory that we are               unable to sell;          o    the discretionary nature of our customers' demands and spending               patterns;          o    changes in market and economic conditions; and          o    competition.In addition, our quarterly operating results could be materially adverselyaffected by political instability, war, acts of terrorism or other disasters.          Sales of our products are somewhat seasonal due to consumer spendingpatterns, which tend to result in significantly stronger sales in our Septemberand December fiscal quarters, especially as a result of the holiday season. Thispattern will probably not change significantly in the future. Although webelieve that the seasonality of our business is based primarily on the timing ofconsumer                                       18demand for our products, fluctuations in operating results can also result fromother factors affecting us and our competitors, including new productdevelopments or introductions, availability of products for resale, competitivepricing pressures, changes in product mix, pricing and product reviews and othermedia coverage. Due to the seasonality of our business, our results for interimperiods are not necessarily indicative of our results for the year.          Our sales and earnings can also be affected by changes in the generaleconomy since purchases of consumer electronics are generally discretionary forconsumers. Our success is influenced by a number of economic factors whichaffect disposable consumer income, such as employment levels, businessconditions, interest rates and taxation rates. Adverse changes in these economicfactors, among others, may restrict consumer spending, thereby negativelyeffecting our sales and profitability.          As a result of these and other factors, revenues for any quarter aresubject to significant variation, which may adversely affect our results ofoperations and the market price for our common stock.IF OUR THIRD PARTY SALES REPRESENTATIVES FAIL TO ADEQUATELY PROMOTE, MARKET ANDSELL OUR PRODUCTS, OUR REVENUES COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE.          A significant portion of our product sales are made through thirdparty sales representative organizations, whose members are not our employees.Our level of sales depends on the effectiveness of these organizations, as wellas the effectiveness of our own employees. Some of these third partyrepresentatives may sell (and do sell), with our permission, competitiveproducts manufactured by other third parties as well as our products. During ourfiscal years ended March 31, 2006 and 2005, these organizations were responsiblefor approximately 55% and 45%, respectively, of our net revenues during suchperiods. In addition, two of these representative organizations were responsiblefor a significant portion of these revenues. If any of our third party salesrepresentative organizations engaged by us, especially our two largest, fails toadequately promote, market and sell our products, our revenues could besignificantly decreased until a replacement organization or distributor could beretained by us. Finding replacement organizations and distributors could be atime consuming process during which our revenues could be negatively impacted.WE MAY SEEK TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS THAT PROVE UNSUCCESSFUL OR STRAIN OR DIVERT OURMANAGEMENT'S ATTENTION AND OUR CAPITAL RESOURCES.          We may seek to grow our business through acquisitions of relatedbusinesses. Such acquisitions present risks that could materially adverselyaffect our earnings, including:          o    the diversion of our management's attention from our everyday               business activities;          o    the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired               business;          o    the incurring of additional expenses related to such               acquisitions, whether or not such acquisitions are consummated;                                       19          o    the contingent and latent risks associated with the past               operations of, and other unanticipated problems arising in, the               acquired business; and          o    the need to expand management, administration and operational               systems.If we make such acquisitions, we cannot predict whether:          o    we will be able to successfully integrate the operations of any               new businesses into our business;          o    we will realize any anticipated benefits of completed               acquisitions; or          o    if there will be substantial unanticipated costs associated with               acquisitions.In addition, future acquisitions by us may result in:          o    potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities;          o    the incurrence of additional debt; and          o    the recognition of significant charges for impairment and               amortization expense related to goodwill and other intangible               assets.We continuously evaluate potential acquisitions of related businesses. However,competition for such potential acquisitions is intense and we have not reachedany agreement or arrangement with respect to any particular acquisition and wemay not be able to complete any acquisitions on favorable terms or at all.WE ARE SUBJECT TO INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE, WHICHCOULD CAUSE MATERIAL REDUCTIONS IN THE SELLING PRICE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR LOSSESOF OUR MARKET SHARE.          The consumer electronics industry is highly competitive, especiallywith respect to pricing and the introduction of new products and features. Ourproducts compete in the low to medium-priced sector of the consumer electronicsmarket and compete primarily on the basis of:          o    reliability;          o    brand recognition;          o    quality;          o    price;          o    design;                                       20          o    consumer acceptance of the Emerson(R) trademark; and          o    quality service and support to retailers and our customers.          In recent years we and many of our competitors have regularly loweredprices, and we expect these pricing pressures to continue. If these pricingpressures are not mitigated by increases in volume, cost reductions from oursupplier or changes in product mix, our revenues and profits could besubstantially reduced. As compared to us, many of our competitors have:          o    significantly longer operating histories;          o    significantly greater managerial, financial, marketing, technical               and other competitive resources; and          o    greater name recognition.          As a result, our competitors may be able to:          o    adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in               customer requirements;          o    devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their               products and services; and          o    respond more effectively to pricing pressures.          These factors could materially adversely affect our operations andfinancial condition. In addition, competition could increase if:          o    new companies enter the market;          o    existing competitors expand their product mix; or          o    we expand into new markets.          An increase in competition could result in material price reductionsor loss of our market share.OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE CANNOT PROTECT OURINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR IF WE INFRINGE ON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTYRIGHTS OF OTHERS.          Our ability to compete effectively will depend on our ability tomaintain and protect our proprietary rights. We own the Emerson(R) trademark,which is materially important to our business, as well as our licenses, othertrademarks and proprietary rights that are used for certain of our homeentertainment and consumer electronics products. Our trademarks are registeredthroughout the world, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, France,Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom. However, third parties may seek tochallenge, invalidate, circumvent or render                                       21unenforceable any proprietary rights owned by or licensed to us. In addition, inthe event third party licensees fail to protect the integrity of our trademarks,the value of these marks could be materially and adversely affected.          The laws of some foreign countries in which we operate may not protectour proprietary rights to the same extent as do laws in the United States. Theprotections afforded by the laws of such countries may not be adequate toprotect our intellectual property rights.          Our inability to protect our proprietary rights could materiallyadversely affect the license of our trade names and trademarks to third partiesas well as our ability to sell our products. Litigation may be necessary to:          o    enforce our intellectual property rights;          o    protect our trade secrets; and          o    determine the scope and validity of such intellectual property               rights.          Any such litigation, whether or not successful, could result insubstantial costs and diversion of resources and management's attention from theoperation of our business.          We may receive notice of claims of infringement of other parties'proprietary rights. Such actions could result in litigation and we could incursignificant costs and diversion of resources in defending such claims. The partymaking such claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as wellas injunctive or other equitable relief. Such relief could effectively block ourability to make, use, sell, distribute or market our products and services insuch jurisdiction. We may also be required to seek licenses to such intellectualproperty. We cannot predict, however, whether such licenses would be availableor, if available, that such licenses could be obtained on terms that arecommercially reasonable and acceptable to us. The failure to obtain thenecessary licenses or other rights could delay or preclude the sale, manufactureor distribution of our products and could result in increased costs to us.WE COULD BE EXPOSED TO PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHER CLAIMS FOR WHICH OUR PRODUCTLIABILITY OR OTHER INSURANCE MAY BE INADEQUATE.          A failure of any of the products marketed by us may subject us to therisk of product liability claims and litigation arising from injuries allegedlycaused by the improper functioning or design of our products. Although wecurrently maintain product liability insurance in amounts which we consideradequate, we cannot assure that:          o    our insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential               liabilities;          o    adequate product liability insurance will continue to be               available in the future; or          o    our insurance can be maintained on acceptable terms.                                       22          Although we maintain liability insurance in amounts that we consideradequate, we cannot assure that such policies will provide adequate coverageagainst potential liabilities. To the extent product liability or otherlitigation losses are beyond the limits or scope of our insurance coverage, ourexpenses could materially increase.THE INABILITY TO USE OUR TAX NET OPERATING LOSSES COULD RESULT IN A CHARGE TOEARNINGS AND COULD REQUIRE US TO PAY HIGHER TAXES.          We have substantial tax net operating losses available to reducetaxable income for federal and state income tax purposes. A portion of thebenefit associated with the tax net operating losses has been recognized as adeferred tax asset in our financial statements and could be used to reduce ourtax liability in future profitable periods. We believe these net deferred taxassets will be realized through tax planning strategies available in futureperiods and future profitable operating results. Although realization is notassured, we believe it is more likely than not that all of the remaining netdeferred tax assets will be realized. The amount of the deferred tax assetconsidered realizable, however, could be reduced or eliminated in the near termif certain tax planning strategies are not successfully executed, or estimatesof future taxable income during the carry-forward period is reduced.OUR INDEBTEDNESS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FUNDS ANDMAY INCREASE OUR VULNERABILITY TO ECONOMIC OR BUSINESS DOWNTURNS.          From time to time we incur substantial debt in connection with ouroperations. As a result, we may be subject to the risks associated withindebtedness, including:          o    we must dedicate a portion of our cash flows from operations to               pay debt service costs and, as a result, we have less funds               available for operations and other purposes;          o    it may be more difficult and expensive to obtain additional funds               through financings, if such funds are available at all;          o    we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and fluctuations in               interest rates, less able to withstand competitive pressures and               less flexible in reacting to changes in our industry and general               economic conditions; and          o    if we default under any of our existing credit facilities or if               our creditors demand payment of a portion or all of our               indebtedness, we may not have sufficient funds to make such               payments.WE HAVE PLEDGED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS TO SECURE OUR BORROWINGS UNDEROUR CREDIT FACILITIES AND ARE SUBJECT TO COVENANTS THAT MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITYTO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS.          Our indebtedness under our credit facilities is secured bysubstantially all of our assets. If we default under the indebtedness secured byour assets, those assets would be available to the secured creditor to satisfyour obligations to the secured creditor. In addition, our credit facilitiesimpose certain restrictive covenants, including financial, ownership,operational and net worth covenants. Failure to satisfy any of these covenantscould result in all or any of the following:                                       23          o    acceleration of the payment of our outstanding indebtedness;          o    our inability to borrow additional amounts under our existing               financing arrangements; and          o    our inability to secure financing on favorable terms or at all               from alternative sources.          Any of these consequences could significantly reduce the amount ofcash and financing available to us which in turn would adversely affect ourability to operate our business, including acquiring our products from ourmanufacturers and distributing our products to our customers.MARKET RELATED RISKSTHE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT PRICE ANDVOLUME FLUCTUATIONS FROM TIME TO TIME.          The market price for our common stock and for securities of similarcompanies has from time to time experienced significant price and volumefluctuations. Factors which may affect our market price include:          o    market conditions in the industries in which we operate;          o    competition;          o    sales or the possibility of sales of our common stock;          o    our results of operations and financial condition; and          o    general economic conditions.          Furthermore, the stock market has experienced significant price andvolume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of particularcompanies. These market fluctuations may also adversely affect the market priceof our common stock.OUR ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS AND DELAWARE LAW MAY MAKE IT HARDER FOR US TO BEACQUIRED WITHOUT THE CONSENT AND COOPERATION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS ANDMANAGEMENT.          Several provisions of our organizational documents and Delaware lawmay deter or prevent a takeover attempt, including a takeover attempt in whichthe potential purchaser offers to pay a per share price greater than the currentmarket price of our common stock. Under the terms of our certificate ofincorporation, our board of directors has the authority, without further actionby the stockholders, to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more seriesand to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof. Theability to issue shares of preferred stock could tend to discourage takeover oracquisition proposals not supported by our current board of directors.                                       24IF OUR COMMON STOCK IS DE-LISTED FROM THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE, SHAREHOLDERSMAY NOT BE ABLE TO RESELL THEIR SHARES AT OR ABOVE THE PRICE AT WHICH THE SHARESWERE PURCHASED, OR AT ALL.          In order for our common stock to continue to be listed on the AmericanStock Exchange, we must meet the current American Stock Exchange continuedlisting requirements, including, among other things, maintaining a majority ofindependent directors, satisfying the audit committee composition requirementsand meeting our filing requirements with the SEC. If we are unable to meet theserequirements, our common stock could be de-listed from the American StockExchange. If our common stock were to be de-listed from the American StockExchange, our common stock could continue to trade on the National Associationof Securities Dealers' over-the-counter bulletin board or on the Pink Sheets, asthe case may be. Any such de-listing of our common stock could have an adverseeffect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for ourcommon stock, not only in terms of the number of shares that can be bought andsold at a given price, but also through delays in the timing of transactions andless coverage of us by securities analysts, if any. Also, if in the future wewere to determine that we need to seek additional equity capital, it could havean adverse effect on our ability to raise capital in the public or privateequity markets.FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION          This report contains forward looking statements made pursuant to thesafe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995under Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E ofthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
