Senior officers may also make verbal statements to    analysts, investors, the media and others that are    forward-looking. Forward-looking statements may relate, for    example, to future operations, prospects, strategies, financial    condition, economic performance (including growth and earnings),    industry conditions and demand for our products and services.    The Company cautions that its forward-looking statements involve    risks and uncertainties, and while we believe that our    expectations for the future are reasonable in view of currently    available information, you are cautioned not to place undue    reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or    events may differ materially from those indicated in our    forward-looking statements as a result of various important    factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to, those    discussed below.     Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are    made, and the Company undertakes no duty to update its    forward-looking statements except as required by law. You are    advised, however, to review any further disclosures we make on    related subjects in our subsequent    Forms 10-Q,Form 8-K    and other reports to the SEC.     Set forth below are the material risks and uncertainties that,    if they were to occur, could materially and adversely affect our    business or could cause our actual results to differ materially    from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements    in this report and in the other public statements we make.    Please be aware that these risks may change over time and other    risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may    emerge at any    8Table of Contents    time, and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to    which they may affect our business, financial condition, results    of operations or the trading price of our securities. Our    business will be adversely affected if demand for our products    slows.     Our business depends on customer demand for the products that we    distribute. Demand for these products depends on many factors.     With respect to our automotive group, the primary factors are:           the number of miles vehicles are driven annually, as higher    vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair;           the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle    manufacturers and the length of the warranty or maintenance    offered on new vehicles;           the number of vehicles in current service that are six years old    and older, as these vehicles are typically no longer under the    original vehicle manufacturers warranty and will need more    maintenance and repair than newer vehicles;           gas prices, as increases in gas prices may deter consumers from    using their vehicles;           changes in travel patterns which may cause consumers to rely    more on other transportation;           restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair    information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by    governmental regulation, as consumers may be forced to have all    diagnostic work, repairs and maintenance performed by the    vehicle manufacturers dealer networks; and           the economy generally, which in declining conditions may cause    consumers to defer vehicle maintenance and repair and defer    discretionary spending.     With respect to our industrial parts group, the primary factors    are:           the level of industrial production and manufacturing capacity    utilization, as these indices reflect the need for industrial    replacement parts;           changes in manufacturing reflected in the level of the Institute    for Supply Managements Purchasing Managers Index, as an    index reading of 50 or more implies an expanding manufacturing    economy, while a reading below 50 implies contracting    manufacturing economy;           the consolidation of certain of our manufacturing customers and    the trend of manufacturing operations being moved    overseas; and           the economy in general.     With respect to our office products group, the primary factors    are:           the level of unemployment, especially as it relates to white    collar and service jobs, as this impacts the need for business    products; and           the economy in general.     With respect to our electrical/electronic materials group, the    primary factors are:           changes in manufacturing reflected in the level of the Institute    for Supply Managements Purchasing Managers Index, as an    index reading of 50 or more implies an expanding manufacturing    economy, while a reading below 50 implies contracting    manufacturing economy; and           the economy in general.    9Table of Contents Uncertainty    and/or deterioration in general macro-economic conditions,    including unemployment, inflation or deflation, high energy    costs, uncertain credit markets, or other economic conditions,    could have a negative impact on our business, financial    condition, results of operations and cash flows.     Our business and operating results may in the future be    adversely affected by uncertain global economic conditions,    including instability in credit markets, declining consumer and    business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, volatile    exchange rates, and other challenges that could affect the    global economy. Both our commercial and retail customers may    experience deterioration of their financial resources, which    could result in existing or potential customers delaying or    canceling plans to purchase our products. Our vendors could    experience similar conditions, which could impact their ability    to fulfill their obligations to us. Future weakness in the    global economy could adversely affect our results of operations,    financial condition and cash flows in future periods. We    depend on our relationships with our vendors, and a disruption    of our vendor relationships or a disruption in our vendors    operations could harm our business.     As a distributor of automotive replacement parts, industrial    parts, office products and electrical/electronic materials, our    business depends on developing and maintaining close and    productive relationships with our vendors. We depend on our    vendors to sell us quality products at favorable prices. Many    factors outside our control, including, without limitation, raw    material shortages, inadequate manufacturing capacity, labor    disputes, transportation disruptions or weather conditions,    could adversely affect our vendors ability to deliver to    us quality merchandise at favorable prices in a timely manner.    Furthermore, financial or operational difficulties with a    particular vendor could cause that vendor to increase the cost    of the products or decrease the quality of the products we    purchase from it. Vendor consolidation could also limit the    number of suppliers from which we may purchase products and    could materially affect the prices we pay for these products. In    our automotive business, the number of vendors could decrease    considerably, and the prices charged to us by the remaining    vendors could increase, to the extent that vehicle production    slows due to a decline in consumer spending and, possibly, the    failure of one or more of the large automobile manufacturers. We    would suffer an adverse impact if our vendors limit or cancel    the return privileges that currently protect us from inventory    obsolescence. We    face substantial competition in the industries in which we do    business.     The sale of automotive and industrial parts, office products and    electrical materials is highly competitive and impacted by many    factors, including name recognition, product availability,    customer service, anticipating changing customer preferences,    store location, and pricing pressures. Because we seek to offer    competitive prices, if our competitors reduce their prices, we    may be forced to reduce our prices, which could result in a    material decline in our revenues and earnings. Increased    competition among distributors of automotive and industrial    parts, office products and electronic materials, including    internet-related initiatives, could cause a material adverse    effect on our results of operations. The Company anticipates no    decline in competition in any of its four business segments in    the foreseeable future.     In particular, the market for replacement automotive parts is    highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of    competitors. We compete primarily with national and regional    auto parts chains, independently owned regional and local    automotive parts and accessories stores, automobile dealers that    supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories, mass    merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products    and regional and local full service automotive repair shops.    Furthermore, the automotive aftermarket has experienced    consolidation in recent years. Consolidation among our    competitors could further enhance their financial position,    provide them with the ability to provide more competitive prices    to customers for whom we compete, and allow them to achieve    increased efficiencies in their consolidated operations that    enable them to more effectively compete for customers. If we are    unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies    or if our competitors develop more effective strategies, we    could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline.    10Table of ContentsWe may    not be able to successfully implement our business initiatives    in each of our four business segments to grow our sales and    earnings, which could adversely affect our business, financial    condition, results of operations and cash flows.     We have implemented numerous initiatives in each of our four    business segments to grow sales and earnings, including the    introduction of new and expanded product lines, geographic    expansion (including acquisitions), sales to new markets,    enhanced customer marketing programs and a variety of gross    margin and cost savings initiatives. If we are unable to    implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively, or if    these initiatives are unsuccessful, our business, financial    condition, results of operations and cash flows could be    adversely affected.     Successful implementation of these initiatives also depends on    factors specific to the automotive parts industry and the other    industries in which we operate and numerous other factors that    may be beyond our control. In addition to the other risk factors    contained in this Item 1A. Risk Factors
,    adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our    business initiatives and have a material adverse affect on our    business, financial condition, results of operations and cash    flows:           the competitive environment in our end markets may force us to    reduce prices below our desired pricing level or increase    promotional spending;           our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to    meet customers needs for our products in a timely manner;           our ability to successfully enter new markets;           our ability to effectively manage our costs;           our ability to continue to grow through acquisitions and    successfully integrate acquired businesses in our existing    operations; and           the economy in general. Because    we are involved in litigation from time to time and are subject    to numerous laws and governmental regulations, we could incur    substantial judgments, fines, legal fees and other    costs.     We are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from    customers, employees or other third parties for various actions.    The damages sought against us in some of these litigation    proceedings are substantial. Although we maintain liability    insurance for some litigation claims, if one or more of the    claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or    if our insurance policies do not cover a claim, this could have    a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition,    results of operations and cash flows.     Additionally, we are subject to numerous federal, state and    local laws and governmental regulations relating to    environmental protection, product quality standards, building    and zoning requirements, as well as employment law matters. If    we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations,    we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or    sanctions, while incurring substantial legal fees and costs. In    addition, our capital expenses could increase due to remediation    measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant    with any existing or future laws or regulations"

RISK FACTORS."" --> ITEM 1A.  RISK    FACTORS.     Set forth below are some risks and uncertainties that, if they    were to occur, could materially and adversely affect our    business or could cause our actual results to differ materially    from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements    in this report and in the other public statements we make. Our    forward-looking statements may relate, for example, to our    future operations, prospects, strategies, financial condition,    economic performance (including growth and earnings), industry    conditions and demand for our products and services. While we    believe that our expectations for the future are reasonable in    view of currently available information, you are cautioned not    to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, due    in part to the risk factors below.     Forward-looking statements made herein, as well as in materials    we file with the SEC or otherwise release to the public,    including materials that we make available on our website and    verbal statements made by senior officers to analysts,    investors, the media and others, are subject to the safe harbor    provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of    1995. Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they    are made, and the Company undertakes no duty to update its    forward-looking statements except as required by law. You are    advised, however, to review any further disclosures we make on    related subjects in our subsequent    Forms 10-Q,10-K,8-K and    other reports to the SEC. We    Depend On Our Relationships with Our Vendors, and a Disruption    of Our Vendor Relationships or a Disruption in Our Vendors    Operations Could Harm Our Business     As a distributor of automotive replacement parts, industrial    parts, office products and electrical/electronic materials, our    business depends on developing and maintaining close and    productive relationships with our vendors. We depend on our    vendors to sell us quality products at favorable prices. Many    factors outside our control may harm our relationships with our    vendors. For example, financial or operational difficulties with    a vendor could cause that vendor to increase the cost of the    products we purchase from it. Vendor consolidation could also    limit the number of suppliers from which we may purchase    products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these    products. Also, consolidation among automotive parts or    industrial parts and office product suppliers could disrupt our    relationship with some vendors. In our automotive business, the    number of vendors could decrease considerably, and the prices    charged to us by the remaining vendors could increase, as    vehicle production slows due to the decline in consumer spending    and, possibly, the failure of one or more of the large    automobile manufacturers. We would suffer an adverse impact if    our vendors limit or cancel the return privileges that currently    protect us from inventory obsolescence. A disruption of our    vendor relationships or a disruption in our vendors    operations could have a material adverse effect on our business    and results of operations. Our    Business Likely Will Continue To Be Impacted By Declining    Economic Conditions     Our business and results of operations may continue to be    adversely impacted by declining global, national and local    economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer,    commercial and industrial spending. These economic conditions    have deteriorated significantly in recent months. Some of the    factors that have contributed to recent reduced levels of    spending include conditions in the residential real estate and    mortgage markets, conditions in the automobile industry,    increases in fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare    costs, access to credit, high unemployment rates, declining    consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors. These    factors had a material adverse effect on demand for the    Companys products and services and on the Companys    financial condition and operating results in the fourth quarter    of 2008. The current difficult economic climate is not expected    to improve significantly in the near term, and the resulting low    levels of consumer, commercial and industrial spending could    continue to result in weakened demand for the products of all of    our business groups for the foreseeable future.    8Table of ContentsOur    Business Will Be Adversely Affected If Demand for Our Products    Slows     Our business depends on customer demand for the products that we    distribute. Demand for these products depends on many factors.     With respect to our automotive group, the primary factors are:           the number of miles vehicles are driven annually, as higher    vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair;           the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle    manufacturers and the length of the warranty or maintenance    offered on new vehicles;           the number of vehicles in current service that are six years old    and older, as these vehicles are typically no longer under the    original vehicle manufacturers warranty and will need more    maintenance and repair than newer vehicles;           gas prices, as increases in gas prices may deter consumers from    using their vehicles;           changes in travel patterns which may cause consumers to rely    more on other transportation;           restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair    information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by    governmental regulation, as consumers may be forced to have all    diagnostic work, repairs and maintenance performed by the    vehicle manufacturers dealer networks; and           the economy generally.     With respect to our industrial parts group, the primary factors    are:           the level of industrial production and manufacturing capacity    utilization, as these indices impact the need for industrial    replacement parts;           changes in the level of the Institute for Supply    Managements Purchasing Managers Index, as an index reading    of 50 or more implies an expanding manufacturing economy, while    a reading below 50 implies contracting manufacturing economy; and           the economy in general.     With respect to our office products group, the primary factors    are :           the level of unemployment especially as it relates to white    collar and service jobs, as this impacts the need for business    products; and           the economy in general.     With respect to our electrical/electronic materials group, the    primary factors are:           changes in the level of the Institute for Supply    Managements Purchasing Managers Index, as an index reading    of 50 or more implies an expanding manufacturing economy, while    a reading below 50 implies contracting manufacturing economy; and           the economy in general. We    Face Substantial Competition in the Industries in Which We Do    Business     The sale of automotive and industrial parts, office products and    electronic materials is highly competitive and impacted by many    factors including name recognition, product availability,    customer service, anticipating changing customer preferences,    store location, and pricing pressures. Because we seek to offer    competitive prices, if our competitors reduce their prices, we    may be forced to reduce our prices, which could result in a    material decline in our revenues and earnings. Increased    competition among distributors of automotive and industrial    parts, office products and electronic materials, including    internet-related initiatives, could cause a material adverse    effect on our results of operations.    9Table of Contents    In particular, the market for replacement automotive parts is    highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of    competitors.

If    we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive    strategies, including internet related initiatives, or if our    competitors develop more effective strategies, we could lose    customers and our sales and profits may decline. The    Impairment of Financial Institutions Could Adversely Affect    Us     The capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility    and disruption for more than twelve months. In the past several    months, volatility and disruptions have increased and recently    reached unprecedented levels. We have exposure to counterparties    with which we routinely execute transactions. Such    counterparties include commercial banks, insurance companies,    investment funds and other financial institutions, some of which    may be exposed to bankruptcy or liquidity risks. While we have    not realized any significant losses to date, a bankruptcy or    illiquidity event by one of our significant counterparties could    materially and adversely affect our access to capital, future    business and results of operations"

We depend on our vendors to sell us quality products atfavorable prices. Many factors outside our control may harm these relationships. For example,financial or operational difficulties with a vendor could cause that vendor to increase the cost ofthe products we purchase from it. Vendor consolidation could also limit the number of suppliersfrom which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for theseproducts. Also, consolidation among automotive parts or industrial parts and office productsuppliers could disrupt our relationship with some vendors. A disruption of our vendorrelationships or a disruption in our vendors operations could have a material adverse effect onour business and results of operations.Our Business and Results of Operations Could Be Impacted by Certain Laws.We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to theoperation of our business, such as laws and regulations relating to environmental and employmentmatters. Because such laws and regulations are subject to change without notice, we cannotanticipate the potential costs of compliance. On the other hand, if we fail to comply withexisting or future laws or regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines orsanctions. There can be no assurance that the cost of compliance, or a material failure by us tocomply, with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us in thefuture.Risks Relating to Our IndustryWe Face Substantial Competition in the Industries in Which We Do Business.The industries in which we do business are highly competitive. The sale of automotive andindustrial parts, office products and electronic materials is highly competitive in many areas,including name recognition, product availability, customer service, anticipating changing customerpreferences, store location and price. Increased competition among distributors of automotive andindustrial parts, office products and electronic materials could cause a material adverse effect onour results of operations.-8-Table of ContentsIn particular, the market for replacement automotive parts is highly competitive and subjects us toa wide variety of competitors. We compete primarily with national and regional auto parts chains,independently owned automotive parts and accessories stores, automobile dealers that supplymanufacturer replacement parts and accessories, mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sellautomotive products and regional and local full service automotive repair shops. If we are unableto continue to develop successful competitive strategies, or if our competitors develop moreeffective strategies, we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline.Our Business May Be Materially Affected If Demand for Our Products Slows.Our business depends on customer demand for the products that we distribute. Demand for theseproducts depends on many factors. With respect to our automotive group, the primary factors are:the number of miles vehicles are driven annually, as higher vehicle mileage increases the need formaintenance and repair; the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehiclemanufacturers and the length of the warranty or maintenance offered on new vehicles; the number ofvehicles in current service that are six years old and older, as these vehicles are typically nolonger under the original vehicle manufacturers warranty and will need more maintenance and repairthan newer vehicles; restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed bythe original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation; and the economy generally.Our Business May Be Impacted by General Economic Conditions and Local, National and Global Events.Our business and results of operations also may be impacted by general economic conditions,conditions in local markets or other factors that we cannot control, including: job growth andunemployment conditions, industrial output and capacity and capital expenditures, reduction inmanufacturing capacity in our targeted geographic markets due to consolidation and the transfer ofmanufacturing capacity to foreign countries, weather, terrorist acts, pricing pressures of ourcompetitors and customers, shortages of fuel or interruptions in transportation systems, laborstrikes, work stoppages, or other interruptions to or difficulties in the employment of labor inthe major markets where we operate, changes in interest rates, inflation or currency exchangerates, changes in accounting policies and practices and changes in regulatory policies andpractices.-9-Table of Contents"
