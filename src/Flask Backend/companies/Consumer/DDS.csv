4,DDS,DILLARDS INC  -CL A,2022-03-29,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS.The risks described in this Item 1A, Risk Factors
, of this Annual Report could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company cautions that forward-looking statements, as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on estimates, projections, beliefs and assumptions of management at the time of such statements and are not guarantees of future performance.  The Company disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements based on the occurrence of future events, the receipt of new information, or otherwise.  Forward-looking statements of the Company involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors.  Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by the Company and its management as a result of a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.Risks Related to the COVID-19 PandemicThe COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on public health, our supply chain, the health and well-being of our employees and customers, and the retail industry in general, has had, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In December 2019, a strain of coronavirus, now known as COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China.  Since that time, the virus has rapidly spread to other countries around the world, including the United States.  In response to the pandemic, national and local governments, including those in the regions in which we operate, have taken various measures to attempt to slow the spread of the virus, including travel bans; prohibitions on group events and large gatherings; extended shutdowns of schools, government offices and certain businesses; curfews and recommendations to practice “social distancing.”  Accordingly, the Company began closing its stores on March 19, 2020, and all store locations were temporarily closed by April 9, 2020.  The Company reopened all stores as of June 2, 2020.The Company sources a significant portion of its private label and exclusive brand merchandise from countries that have experienced widespread transmission of the virus, including China. Additionally, many of the Company’s branded merchandise vendors may also source a significant portion of their merchandise from these same countries.  Manufacturing capacity in those countries has been materially impacted by the pandemic, which has negatively impacted our supply chain.  If this continues, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to locate alternative sources of supply for our merchandise on acceptable terms, or at all.  If we are unable to adequately source our merchandise or purchase appropriate amounts of merchandise from branded vendors, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.Risks Related to Retail OperationsThe retail merchandise business is highly competitive, and that competition could lower our revenues, margins and market share.We conduct our retail merchandise business under highly competitive conditions.  Competition is characterized by many factors including location, reputation, fashion, merchandise assortment, advertising, operating efficiency, price, quality, customer service and credit availability.  We have numerous competitors nationally, locally and on the Internet, including conventional department stores, specialty retailers, off-price and discount stores, boutiques, mass merchants, and Internet and mail-order retailers.  Although we are a large regional department store, some of our competitors are larger than us with greater financial resources and, as a result, may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting and selling their products.  Additionally, we compete in certain markets with a substantial number of retailers that specialize in one or more types of merchandise that we sell.  Also, online retail shopping continues to rapidly evolve, and we continue to expect competition in the e-commerce market to intensify in the future as the Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping.  We anticipate that intense competition will continue from both existing competitors and new entrants.  If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for products, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share.Our business is seasonal, and fluctuations in our revenues during the last quarter of our fiscal year can have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations.Our business, like many other retailers, is subject to seasonal influences, with a significant portion of sales and income typically realized during the last quarter of our fiscal year due to the holiday season.  Our fiscal fourth-quarter results may fluctuate significantly, based on many factors, including holiday spending patterns and weather conditions, and any such fluctuation could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year.  Because of the seasonality 4Table of Contents Contentsof our business, our operating results vary considerably from quarter to quarter, and results from any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.A shutdown of, or disruption in, any of the Company's distribution or fulfillment centers would have an adverse effect on the Company's business and operations.Our business depends on the orderly operation of the process of receiving and distributing merchandise, which relies on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management of distribution or fulfillment centers.  Although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient and that we have appropriate contingency plans, unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fire, severe weather conditions, natural disasters or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements or other shipping problems may result in the loss of inventory and/or delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and customers.Current store locations may become less desirable, and desirable new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations.In order to generate customer traffic and for convenience of our customers, we attempt to locate our stores in desirable locations within shopping malls and open air centers.  Our stores benefit from the abilities that our Company, other anchor tenants and other area attractions have to generate consumer traffic.  Adverse changes in the development of new shopping malls in the United States, the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping malls, competition with other retailers for prominent locations, the success of individual shopping malls and the success or failure of other anchor tenants, the continued proper management and development of existing malls, or the continued popularity of shopping malls may continue to impact our ability to maintain or grow our sales in our existing stores, as well as our ability to open new stores, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Ownership and leasing of significant amounts of real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses.We own the land and building, or lease the land and/or the building, for all of our stores.  Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks associated with owning and leasing real estate.  In particular, the value of our real estate assets could decrease, and their operating costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends and supply or demand for the use of the store, which may result from competition from similar stores in the area.  Additionally, we are subject to potential liability for environmental conditions on the property that we own or lease.  If an existing owned store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be required to record an impairment charge and/or exit costs associated with the disposal of the store. We generally cannot cancel our leases. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be committed to perform certain obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term.  In addition, as each of the leases expires, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations.  We may not be able to close an unprofitable owned store due to an existing operating covenant which may cause us to operate the location at a loss and prevent us from finding a more desirable location.  We have approximately 74 stores along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts that are covered by third-party insurance but are self-insured for property and merchandise losses related to ""named storms.""  As a result, the repair and replacement costs will be borne by us for damage to any of these stores from ""named storms,"" which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Variations in the amount of vendor allowances received could adversely impact our operating results.We receive vendor allowances for advertising, payroll and margin maintenance that are a strategic part of our operations.  A reduction in the amount of cooperative advertising allowances would likely cause us to consider other methods of advertising as well as the volume and frequency of our product advertising, which could increase/decrease our expenditures and/or revenue.  Decreased payroll reimbursements would either cause payroll costs to rise, negatively impacting operating income, or cause us to reduce the number of employees, which may cause a decline in sales.  A decline in the amount of margin maintenance allowances would either increase cost of sales, which would negatively impact gross margin and operating income, or cause us to reduce merchandise purchases, which may cause a decline in sales.A decrease in cash flows from our operations and constraints to accessing other financing sources could limit our ability to fund our operations, capital projects, interest and debt repayments, stock repurchases and dividends.Our business depends upon our operations to generate strong cash flow and to some extent upon the availability of financing sources to supply capital to fund our general operating activities, capital projects, interest and debt repayments, stock repurchases and dividends.  Our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or the lack of available financing in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed could adversely affect our financial performance including our earnings per share.5Table of Contents ContentsOur profitability may be adversely impacted by weather conditions.Our merchandise assortments reflect assumptions regarding expected weather patterns and our profitability depends on our ability to timely deliver seasonally appropriate inventory.  Unexpected or unseasonable weather conditions could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with consumer needs.  For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of the Company's inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions.  Additionally, extreme weather or natural disasters, particularly in the areas in which our stores are located, could also severely hinder our ability to timely deliver seasonally appropriate merchandise.  For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms, hurricanes or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for the Company's customers to travel to its stores and thereby reduce the Company's sales and profitability.  A reduction in the demand for or supply of our seasonal merchandise or reduced sales due to reduced customer traffic in our stores could have an adverse effect on our inventory levels, gross margins and results of operations.Natural disasters, war, acts of violence, acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts, and public health issues may adversely impact our business.The occurrence of, or threat of, a natural disaster, war (including the recent conflict in Ukraine and the resulting sanctions imposed on Russia by the U.S. and other countries), acts of violence, acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts, and public health issues (including the recent COVID-19 pandemic) could disrupt our operations, disrupt international trade and supply chain efficiencies, suppliers or customers, or result in political or economic instability.  If commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed, our business may be adversely impacted, as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers, fulfillment centers, stores or directly to customers.  As a result of the occurrence of, or threat of, a natural disaster, war, acts of violence or acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts, and public health issues (including the recent COVID-19 pandemic) in the United States, we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our stores, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Risks Related to Consumer DemandChanges in economic, financial and political conditions, and the resulting impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The retail merchandise business is highly sensitive to changes in overall economic and political conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending.  Various economic conditions affect the level of disposable income consumers have available to spend on the merchandise we offer, including unemployment rates, inflation, interest rates, taxation, energy costs, the availability of consumer credit, the price of gasoline, consumer confidence in future economic conditions and general business conditions. Due to the Company's concentration of stores in energy producing regions, volatile conditions in these regions could adversely affect the Company's sales.  Consumer purchases of discretionary items and other retail products generally decline during recessionary periods, and also may decline at other times when changes in consumer spending patterns affect us unfavorably.  In addition, any significant decreases in shopping mall traffic could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Our business is dependent upon our ability to accurately predict rapidly changing fashion trends, customer preferences and other fashion-related factors.Our sales and operating results depend in part on our ability to effectively predict and quickly respond to changes in fashion trends and customer preferences.  We continuously assess emerging styles and trends and focus on developing a merchandise assortment to meet customer preferences at competitive prices.  Even with these efforts, we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully meet constantly changing fashion trends and customer preferences.  If we are unable to successfully predict or respond to changing styles or preferences, we may be faced with lower sales, increased inventories, additional markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow-moving inventory and lower gross margins, all of which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to our Brand and Product OfferingsOur failure to protect our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business.We offer our customers quality products at competitive prices and a high level of customer service, resulting in a well-recognized brand and customer loyalty.  As discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor, our brand and customer loyalty depend, in part, on our ability to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner.  Failure to respond rapidly to changing trends could diminish brand and customer loyalty and impact our reputation with customers.6Table of Contents ContentsAdditionally, the value of our reputation is based, in part, on subjective perceptions of the quality of our merchandise selections. Isolated incidents involving us or our merchandise that erode trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and our business, particularly if the incidents result in significant adverse publicity or governmental investigation or inquiry.  Similarly, information posted about us, including our lines of exclusive brand merchandise, on the Internet, including social media platforms that allow individuals access to a wide audience of consumers and other interested persons, may adversely affect our reputation, even if the information is inaccurate. Any significant damage to our brand or reputation could negatively impact sales, diminish customer trust and generate negative sentiment, any of which would harm our business and results of operation.Risks associated with our private label merchandise program could adversely affect our business. Our merchandise selections include our lines of exclusive brand merchandise, such as Antonio Melani, Gianni Bini, GB, Roundtree & Yorke and Daniel Cremieux.  We expect to grow our private label merchandise program and have invested in our development and procurement resources and marketing efforts related to these exclusive brand offerings.  The expansion of our private label merchandise subjects us to certain additional risks.  These include, among others, risks related to: our failure to comply with government and industry safety standards; our ability to successfully protect our trademark and license portfolio and our other proprietary rights in our exclusive brands/private label merchandise program; and risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing.  In addition, damage to the reputation of our private label trade names may generate negative customer sentiment.  Our failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Risks Related to Material Sourcing and SupplyFluctuations in the price of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods and negatively impact our financial results.Fluctuations in the price and availability of fuel, labor and raw materials as a result of inflation and other factors, combined with the inability to mitigate or to pass cost increases on to our customers or to change our merchandise mix as a result of such cost increases, could have an adverse impact on our profitability.  Vendors and other suppliers of the Company may experience similar fluctuations, which may subject us to the effects of their price increases.  For example, we have recently experienced significant inflation causing increases in fuel, materials and shipping costs.  We may or may not be able to pass such costs along to our customers.  Even when successful, attempts to pass such costs along to our customers might cause a decline in our sales volume.  Additionally, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair our ability and the ability of our branded vendors to meet purchasing requirements in a timely manner.  A decrease in domestic transportation capacity could impair our ability and the ability of our branded vendors to timely deliver merchandise to our distribution centers and stores.  For instance, the United States is currently experiencing a shortage of truck drivers and trucks and truck parts, which may impact overall costs of transportation and the timely delivery of merchandise to our stores.  Both the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs.Third party suppliers on whom we rely to obtain materials and provide production facilities and other third parties with whom we do business may experience financial difficulties due to current and future economic conditions, which may subject them to insolvency risk or may result in their inability or unwillingness to perform the obligations they owe us. Our suppliers may experience financial difficulties due to a downturn in the industry or in other macroeconomic environments. Our suppliers’ cash and working capital needs can be adversely impacted by the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor as a result of inflation and other factors.  Current and future economic conditions may prevent our suppliers from obtaining financing on favorable terms, which could impact their ability to supply us with merchandise on a timely basis.We are also party to contractual and business relationships with various other parties, including vendors and service providers, pursuant to which such parties owe performance, payment and other obligations to us.  In some cases, we depend upon such third parties to provide essential products, services or other benefits, such as advertising, software development and support, logistics and other goods and services necessary to operate our business.  Economic, industry and market conditions could result in increased risks to us associated with the potential financial distress of such third parties.If any of the third parties with which we do business become subject to insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, our rights and benefits in relation to, contractual and business relationships with such third parties could be terminated, modified in a manner adverse to us or otherwise materially impaired.  There can be no assurances that we would be able to arrange for alternate or replacement contractual or business relationships on terms as favorable as our existing ones, if at all.  Any inability on our part to do so could negatively affect our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.7Table of Contents ContentsThe Company and third-party suppliers on whom we rely source a significant portion of the merchandise we sell from foreign countries, which exposes us to certain risks that include political and economic conditions and supply chain disruptions.Political discourse in the United States continues to focus on ways to discourage corporations in the United States from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions.  Since 2018, the United States has imposed additional tariffs on certain items sourced from foreign countries, including China, and has modified, withdrawn from and renegotiated some of its trade agreements with foreign countries.  While recent tariffs and modifications to trade agreements have not resulted in a material impact on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations, any additional actions, if ultimately enacted, could negatively impact our ability and the ability of our third-party vendors and suppliers to source products from foreign jurisdictions and could lead to an increase in the cost of goods and adversely affect our profitability.Other trade restrictions imposed by the United States Government, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as United States or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us or may require us to modify our current business practices, any of which could adversely affect our profitability.  For example, beginning in Fiscal 2020, the United States Government took significant steps to address the forced labor concerns in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China (""Xinjiang Region""), including withhold release orders (“WROs"") issued by United States Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”).  The WROs allow CBP to detain and deny entry of imports suspected of containing cotton from Xinjiang, regardless of the origin of the finished products.  This affected global supply chains, including our own supply chains for cotton-containing products.  In late Fiscal 2021, the United States Government enacted the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (“UFLPA”), which presumes goods produced in the Xinjiang Region, or with labor linked to specified Chinese government-sponsored labor programs, were produced using forced labor and prohibits importation of such goods into the United States absent clear and convincing evidence proving otherwise.  Compliance with UFLPA could lead to an increase in the cost of goods and adversely affect our profitability.Our timely receipt of merchandise in the United States is dependent on an efficient global supply chain.  Disruptions in the supply chain could adversely impact our ability to obtain adequate inventory on a timely basis and result in lost sales, increased costs and an overall decrease in our profits.  For example, many disruptions in the global transportation network have occurred in Fiscal 2020 and 2021 due to the impact of COVID-19 and other factors, including increased shipping costs resulting from increased demand for shipping capacity and the increased cost of fuel.  The California ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which together handle a significant portion of United States merchandise imports including our own imports, have experienced and are expected to continue experiencing delays in processing imported merchandise, thereby resulting in untimely deliveries of merchandise and additional freight costs.Moreover, our third-party suppliers in foreign jurisdictions are subject to political and economic uncertainty.  As a result, we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with changing economic and political conditions in foreign countries where our suppliers are located, including increased import duties, tariffs, trade restrictions and quotas; human rights concerns; working conditions and other labor rights and conditions; the environmental impact in foreign countries where merchandise is produced and raw materials or products are sourced; adverse foreign government regulations; wars, fears of war, terrorist attacks and organizing activities; inflation and adverse fluctuations of foreign currencies; and political unrest.  We cannot predict when, or the extent to which, the countries in which our products are manufactured will experience any of the foregoing events.  Any event causing a disruption or delay of imports from foreign locations would likely increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us and would adversely affect our operating results. Failure by third party suppliers to comply with our supplier compliance programs or applicable laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.All of our suppliers must comply with our supplier compliance programs and applicable laws, including consumer and product safety laws, but we do not control our vendors or their labor and business practices.  The violation of labor or other laws by one or more of our vendors could have an adverse effect on our business.  Additionally, although we diversify our sourcing and production, the failure of any supplier to produce and deliver our goods on time, to meet our quality standards and adhere to our product safety requirements or to meet the requirements of our supplier compliance program or applicable laws, could impact our ability to flow merchandise to our stores or directly to consumers in the right quantities at the right time, which could adversely affect our profitability and could result in damage to our reputation and translate into sales losses.8Table of Contents ContentsRisks Related to our Long-Term Marketing and Servicing AllianceReductions in the income and cash flow from our long-term marketing and servicing alliance related to the private label credit cards could impact operating results and cash flows.Wells Fargo owns and manages the private label credit cards under the Wells Fargo Alliance.  The Wells Fargo Alliance provides for certain payments to be made by Wells Fargo to the Company, including the Company's share of earnings under this alliance.  The income and cash flow that the Company receives from the Wells Fargo Alliance is dependent upon a number of factors including the level of sales on Wells Fargo accounts, the level of balances carried on the Wells Fargo accounts by Wells Fargo customers, payment rates on Wells Fargo accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on Wells Fargo accounts, the level of credit losses for the Wells Fargo accounts, Wells Fargo's ability to extend credit to our customers as well as the cost of customer rewards programs, all of which can vary based on changes in federal and state banking and consumer protection laws and from a variety of economic, legal, social and other factors that we cannot control.  If the income or cash flow that the Company receives from the Wells Fargo Alliance decreases, our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.Credit card operations are subject to numerous federal and state laws that impose disclosure and other requirements upon the origination, servicing, and enforcement of credit accounts, and limitations on the amount of finance charges and fees that may be charged by a credit card provider.  Wells Fargo may be subject to regulations that may adversely impact its operation of the private label credit card.  To the extent that such limitations or regulations materially limit the availability of credit or increase the cost of credit to the cardholders or negatively impact provisions which affect our earnings associated with the private label credit card, our results of operations could be adversely affected.  In addition, changes in credit card use, payment patterns, or default rates could be affected by a variety of economic, legal, social, or other factors over which we have no control and cannot predict with certainty.  Such changes could also negatively impact Wells Fargo's ability to facilitate consumer credit or increase the cost of credit to the cardholders.The Wells Fargo Alliance expires in November 2024. If, when the Wells Fargo Alliance expires, Wells Fargo is unable or unwilling to renew and continue owning and managing our proprietary credit cards on similar terms and conditions as exist today or we are unable to quickly and adequately contract with a comparable replacement vendor, then our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected due to a decrease in private label credit card sales to our cardholding customers and a loss of revenues attributable to payments from Wells Fargo.We are subject to customer payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations.We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, debit cards, credit cards (including the private label credit cards), gift cards and other alternative payment channels. As a result, we are subject to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems.The regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs or accelerate these costs. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which could increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could disrupt our business.Risks Related to Information Technology and Information Security RisksA significant disruption in our information technology systems and network and our inability to adequately maintain and update those systems could materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition.Our operations are largely dependent upon the integrity, security and consistent operation of various systems and data centers, including the point-of-sale systems in the stores, our Internet website, data centers that process transactions, communication systems and various software applications used throughout our Company to order merchandise, track inventory flow, process transactions and generate performance and financial reports. Our information technology systems are also subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyberattacks and ransomware attacks, usage errors by our employees and other items discussed previously in Item 1A, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and acts of war or terrorism. We rely on third-party service providers to provide hardware, software and services necessary to operate our 9Table of Contents Contentsinformation technology systems.  Outages, failures, viruses, attacks, catastrophic events, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by third-party service providers (or their vendors) could also affect our information technology systems.  If our information technology systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and we may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our operations in the interim, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.  Additionally, to keep pace with changing technology, we must continuously provide for the design and implementation of new information technology systems and enhancements of our existing systems.  We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems or maintaining and upgrading existing systems.  Such difficulties could lead to significant expenses or to losses due to disruption in our business.Any failure to maintain the security of the information related to our Company, customers, employees and vendors or the information technology systems on which we rely for our operations could adversely affect our operations, damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, increase our operating costs and materially adversely affect our business and operating results.We receive and store certain personal information about our employees and our customers, including information permitting cashless payments, both in our stores and through our online operations at dillards.com.  In addition, our operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks.  Further, our ability to supply merchandise to and operate our stores, process transactions and generate performance and financial reports are largely dependent on the security and integrity of our information technology network.  We, like other companies, face a risk of unauthorized access to devices and technology assets, as well as computer viruses, worms, bot attacks, ransomware and other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer or employee information and cause system failures and disruptions.  Such events can result in theft, alteration, deletion or encryption of data, or disruption of services provided by the devices and assets, as well as demands to pay a third party to regain access to encrypted files and prevent publication of stolen data.   In addition, employee error, malfeasance or security lapses could result in exposure of confidential information or otherwise adversely disrupt or affect our operations. We rely on third-party service providers to provide hardware, software and services necessary to operate our information technology systems, and the same issues could occur at those third parties and have an effect on our operational technology or data.  Such attacks, if successful, have the potential for creating a loss of sales, business disruption, reputational impact, litigation, liability to consumers, regulatory investigations, or otherwise adversely affect our ability to operate our business.  We have a longstanding Information Security program committed to regular risk assessment and risk mitigation practices surrounding the protection of confidential data and our information technology systems and network.  Our security controls include network segmentation, firewalls, identity and access controls, endpoint protection solutions, as well as specific measures like point-to-point encryption and tokenization solutions for payment card data.  We also maintain data breach preparedness plans, conduct exercises to test response plans, and employ other methods to protect our data and networks, and promote security awareness.  Our Senior Management and Board of Directors exercise oversight of our security measures through various methods, including participation in response preparedness discussions and discussions regarding assessments, expenditures related to security and security controls. It is possible that unauthorized persons might defeat our security measures, those of third-party service providers or vendors, and obtain personal information of customers, employees or others, or compromise our information technology systems.  A breach, whether in our information technology systems or those of our third-party service providers or vendors, resulting in personal information being obtained by or exposed to unauthorized persons, could adversely affect our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties.  Our reputation and our ability to attract new customers could be adversely impacted if we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to properly prevent and respond to these incidents.  In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations. A ransomware attack may also result in exposure to business interruption and lost sales, ransom payments, costs associated with recovery of data and replacement of systems, exposure to customer and employee litigation from disclosure of confidential information, fines and penalties.  A security breach also could result in a violation attributable to the Company of applicable privacy and other laws, and subject us to litigation by private customers, business partners, or securities litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to civil or criminal liability.  The regulatory environment surrounding information security, cybersecurity, and privacy is increasingly demanding, with new and changing requirements, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act.  Security breaches, cyber incidents or allegations that we used personal information in violation of applicable privacy and other laws could result in significant legal and financial exposure.10Table of Contents ContentsLegal and Compliance RisksLitigation with customers, employees and others could harm our reputation and impact operating results.In the ordinary course of business, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions.  We are impacted by trends in litigation, including, but not limited to, class-action allegations brought under various consumer protection, employment and privacy and information security laws.  Additionally, we may be subject to employment-related claims alleging discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and wage issues, including those relating to overtime compensation.  We are susceptible to claims filed by customers alleging responsibility for injury suffered during a visit to a store or from product defects and to lawsuits filed by patent holders alleging patent infringement.  We are also subject to claims filed under our employee stock ownership plan alleging failure to properly manage the plan.  These types of claims, as well as other types of lawsuits to which we are subject from time to time, can distract management's attention from core business operations and impact operating results, particularly if a lawsuit results in an unfavorable outcome.Risks Related to Construction OperationsThe cost-to-cost method of accounting that we use to recognize contract revenues for our construction segment may result in material adjustments, which could result in a credit or a charge against our earnings.Our construction segment recognizes contract revenues based on the cost-to-cost method.  Under this method, estimated contract revenues are measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs.  Estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined.  Total contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum on a quarterly basis as the work progresses and as change orders are approved.  Adjustments are reflected in contract revenues in the period when these estimates are revised.  To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we are required to recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material.Risks Related to EmployeesThe Company depends on its ability to attract and retain quality employees, and failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy and our operating results.The Company's business is dependent upon attracting and retaining quality employees.  The Company has a large number of employees, many of whom are in positions with historically high rates of turnover.  The Company's ability to meet its labor needs while controlling the costs associated with hiring and training new employees is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, changing demographics, prevailing wage rates and current or future minimum wage and healthcare reform legislation.  In addition, as a complex enterprise operating in a highly competitive and challenging business environment, the Company is highly dependent upon management personnel to develop and effectively execute successful business strategies and tactics.  Any circumstances that adversely impact the Company's ability to attract, train, develop and retain quality employees throughout the organization could adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations.Increases in employee wages and the cost of employee benefits could impact the Company’s financial results and cash flows.The Company’s expenses relating to employee wages and health benefits are significant.  Increases in employee wages, including the minimum wage, or unfavorable changes in the cost of healthcare benefits could impact the Company’s financial results and cash flows. Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform have resulted and could continue to result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system.  Due to the breadth and complexity of the U.S. healthcare system, and uncertainty regarding legislative or regulatory changes, the Company is not able to fully determine the impact that future healthcare reform will have on our company sponsored medical plans.11Table of Contents Contents"

, of this Annual Report could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company cautions that forward-looking statements, as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on estimates, projections, beliefs and assumptions of management at the time of such statements and are not guarantees of future performance. The Company disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements based on the occurrence of future events, the receipt of new information, or otherwise. Forward-looking statements of the Company involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by the Company and its management as a result of a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.Risks Related to the COVID-19 PandemicThe COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on public health, our supply chain, the health and well-being of our employees and customers, and the retail industry in general, has had, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In December 2019, a strain of coronavirus, now known as COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. Since that time, the virus has rapidly spread to other countries around the world, including the United States. In response to the pandemic, national and local governments, including those in the regions in which we operate, have taken various measures to attempt to slow the spread of the virus, including travel bans; prohibitions on group events and large gatherings; extended shutdowns of schools, government offices and certain businesses; curfews and recommendations to practice “social distancing.” Accordingly, the Company began closing its stores on March 19, 2020, and all 285 store locations were temporarily closed by April 9, 2020. The Company reopened all stores as of June 2, 2020. Stores are operating at reduced hours and implementing certain safety measures to ensure the safety of our customers and associates, which may have the effect of discouraging shopping or limiting the occupancy of our stores. These measures, and any additional measures that have been and may continue to be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, have substantially decreased and may continue to decrease, the number of customers that visit our stores and the shopping malls in which our stores are located, which has had, and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is unclear how long these measures may remain in place, what additional measures may be imposed, or if our operations will be restored to the levels that existed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our business depends on consumer discretionary spending, and as such, our results are particularly sensitive to economic conditions and consumer confidence. COVID-19 significantly impacted economic conditions, resulting in, among other things, unprecedented increases in the number of people seeking jobless benefits and decreased shopping within our sector.  Although the instances of COVID-19 transmission within the United States have recently declined, it is difficult to predict when and to what extent consumer demand for the products we sell will return to pre-COVID-19 levels.  As a result, even if all of our store locations are fully operational, there can be no guarantee that our revenue will return to its pre-COVID-19 levels.The Company sources a significant portion of its private label and exclusive brand merchandise from countries that have experienced widespread transmission of the virus, including China. Additionally, many of the Company’s branded merchandise vendors may also source a significant portion of their merchandise from these same countries. Manufacturing capacity in those countries has been materially impacted by the pandemic, which has negatively impacted our supply chain. If this continues, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to locate alternative sources of supply for our merchandise on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to adequately source our merchandise or purchase appropriate amounts of merchandise from branded vendors, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.Additionally, in the event that the Company were to experience widespread transmission of the virus at one or more of the Company’s stores or other facilities, the Company could suffer reputational harm or other potential liability. Further, the Company’s business operations may be materially and adversely affected if a significant number of the Company’s employees are impacted by the virus.4Table of ContentsRisks Related to Retail OperationsThe retail merchandise business is highly competitive, and that competition could lower our revenues, margins and market share.We conduct our retail merchandise business under highly competitive conditions. Competition is characterized by many factors including location, reputation, fashion, merchandise assortment, advertising, operating efficiency, price, quality, customer service and credit availability. We have numerous competitors nationally, locally and on the Internet, including conventional department stores, specialty retailers, off-price and discount stores, boutiques, mass merchants, and Internet and mail-order retailers. Although we are a large regional department store, some of our competitors are larger than us with greater financial resources and, as a result, may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting and selling their products. Additionally, we compete in certain markets with a substantial number of retailers that specialize in one or more types of merchandise that we sell. In recent years, competition has intensified as a result of reduced discretionary consumer spending, increased promotional activity, deep price discounting, and few barriers to entry. Also, online retail shopping continues to rapidly evolve, and we continue to expect competition in the e-commerce market to intensify in the future as the Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping. We anticipate that intense competition will continue from both existing competitors and new entrants. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for products, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share.Our business is seasonal, and fluctuations in our revenues during the last quarter of our fiscal year can have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations.Our business, like many other retailers, is subject to seasonal influences, with a significant portion of sales and income typically realized during the last quarter of our fiscal year due to the holiday season. Our fiscal fourth-quarter results may fluctuate significantly, based on many factors, including holiday spending patterns and weather conditions, and any such fluctuation could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year. Because of the seasonality of our business, our operating results vary considerably from quarter to quarter, and results from any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.A shutdown of, or disruption in, any of the Company's distribution or fulfillment centers would have an adverse effect on the Company's business and operations.Our business depends on the orderly operation of the process of receiving and distributing merchandise, which relies on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management of distribution or fulfillment centers. Although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient and that we have appropriate contingency plans, unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fire, severe weather conditions, natural disasters or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements or other shipping problems may result in the loss of inventory and/or delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and customers.Current store locations may become less desirable, and desirable new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations.In order to generate customer traffic and for convenience of our customers, we attempt to locate our stores in desirable locations within shopping malls and open air centers. Our stores benefit from the abilities that our Company, other anchor tenants and other area attractions have to generate consumer traffic. Adverse changes in the development of new shopping malls in the United States, the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping malls, competition with other retailers for prominent locations, the success of individual shopping malls and the success or failure of other anchor tenants, the continued proper management and development of existing malls, or the continued popularity of shopping malls may continue to impact our ability to maintain or grow our sales in our existing stores, as well as our ability to open new stores, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Ownership and leasing of significant amounts of real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses.We own the land and building, or lease the land and/or the building, for all of our stores. Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks associated with owning and leasing real estate. In particular, the value of our real estate assets could decrease, and their operating costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends and supply or demand for the use of the store, which may result from competition from similar stores in the area.  Additionally, we are subject to potential liability for environmental conditions on the property that we own or lease.  If an existing owned store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be required to record an impairment charge and/or exit costs associated with the disposal of the store. We generally cannot cancel our leases. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be committed to perform certain obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each of the leases expires, we may be unable to negotiate 5Table of Contentsrenewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations. We may not be able to close an unprofitable owned store due to an existing operating covenant which may cause us to operate the location at a loss and prevent us from finding a more desirable location. We have approximately 75 stores along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts that are covered by third-party insurance but are self-insured for property and merchandise losses related to ""named storms."" As a result, the repair and replacement costs will be borne by us for damage to any of these stores from ""named storms,"" which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Variations in the amount of vendor allowances received could adversely impact our operating results.We receive vendor allowances for advertising, payroll and margin maintenance that are a strategic part of our operations. A reduction in the amount of cooperative advertising allowances would likely cause us to consider other methods of advertising as well as the volume and frequency of our product advertising, which could increase/decrease our expenditures and/or revenue. Decreased payroll reimbursements would either cause payroll costs to rise, negatively impacting operating income, or cause us to reduce the number of employees, which may cause a decline in sales. A decline in the amount of margin maintenance allowances would either increase cost of sales, which would negatively impact gross margin and operating income, or cause us to reduce merchandise purchases, which may cause a decline in sales.A decrease in cash flows from our operations and constraints to accessing other financing sources could limit our ability to fund our operations, capital projects, interest and debt repayments, stock repurchases and dividends.Our business depends upon our operations to generate strong cash flow and to some extent upon the availability of financing sources to supply capital to fund our general operating activities, capital projects, interest and debt repayments, stock repurchases and dividends. Our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or the lack of available financing in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed could adversely affect our financial performance including our earnings per share.Our profitability may be adversely impacted by weather conditions.Our merchandise assortments reflect assumptions regarding expected weather patterns and our profitability depends on our ability to timely deliver seasonally appropriate inventory. Unexpected or unseasonable weather conditions could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with consumer needs. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of the Company's inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions. Additionally, extreme weather or natural disasters, particularly in the areas in which our stores are located, could also severely hinder our ability to timely deliver seasonally appropriate merchandise. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms, hurricanes or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for the Company's customers to travel to its stores and thereby reduce the Company's sales and profitability. A reduction in the demand for or supply of our seasonal merchandise or reduced sales due to reduced customer traffic in our stores could have an adverse effect on our inventory levels, gross margins and results of operations.Natural disasters, war, acts of violence, acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts, and public health issues may adversely impact our business.The occurrence of, or threat of, a natural disaster, war, acts of violence, acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts, and public health issues (including the recent COVID-19 pandemic) could disrupt our operations, disrupt international trade and supply chain efficiencies, suppliers or customers, or result in political or economic instability. If commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed, our business may be adversely impacted, as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers, fulfillment centers, stores or directly to customers. As a result of the occurrence of, or threat of, a natural disaster, acts of violence or acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts, and public health issues (including the recent COVID-19 pandemic) in the United States, we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our stores, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Risks Related to Consumer DemandChanges in economic, financial and political conditions, and the resulting impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The retail merchandise business is highly sensitive to changes in overall economic and political conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending. Various economic conditions affect the level of disposable income consumers have available to spend on the merchandise we offer, including unemployment rates, interest rates, taxation, energy costs, the availability of consumer credit, the price of gasoline, consumer confidence in future economic conditions and general business conditions. Due to the Company's concentration of stores in energy producing regions, volatile conditions in these regions could adversely affect the Company's sales. Consumer purchases of discretionary items and other retail products generally decline 6Table of Contentsduring recessionary periods, and also may decline at other times when changes in consumer spending patterns affect us unfavorably. In addition, any significant decreases in shopping mall traffic could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Our business is dependent upon our ability to accurately predict rapidly changing fashion trends, customer preferences and other fashion-related factors.Our sales and operating results depend in part on our ability to effectively predict and quickly respond to changes in fashion trends and customer preferences. We continuously assess emerging styles and trends and focus on developing a merchandise assortment to meet customer preferences at competitive prices. Even with these efforts, we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully meet constantly changing fashion trends and customer preferences. If we are unable to successfully predict or respond to changing styles or preferences, we may be faced with lower sales, increased inventories, additional markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow-moving inventory and lower gross margins, all of which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to our Brand and Product OfferingsOur failure to protect our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business.We offer our customers quality products at competitive prices and a high level of customer service, resulting in a well-recognized brand and customer loyalty. As discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor, our brand and customer loyalty depend, in part, on our ability to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. Failure to respond rapidly to changing trends could diminish brand and customer loyalty and impact our reputation with customers.Additionally, the value of our reputation is based, in part, on subjective perceptions of the quality of our merchandise selections. Isolated incidents involving us or our merchandise that erode trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and our business, particularly if the incidents result in significant adverse publicity or governmental investigation or inquiry. Similarly, information posted about us, including our lines of exclusive brand merchandise, on the Internet, including social media platforms that allow individuals access to a wide audience of consumers and other interested persons, may adversely affect our reputation, even if the information is inaccurate. Any significant damage to our brand or reputation could negatively impact sales, diminish customer trust and generate negative sentiment, any of which would harm our business and results of operation.Risks associated with our private label merchandise program could adversely affect our business. Our merchandise selections include our lines of exclusive brand merchandise, such as Antonio Melani, Gianni Bini, GB, Roundtree & Yorke and Daniel Cremieux. We expect to grow our private label merchandise program and have invested in our development and procurement resources and marketing efforts related to these exclusive brand offerings. The expansion of our private label merchandise subjects us to certain additional risks. These include, among others, risks related to: our failure to comply with government and industry safety standards; our ability to successfully protect our trademark and license portfolio and our other  proprietary rights in our exclusive brands/private label merchandise program; and risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing. In addition, damage to the reputation of our private label trade names may generate negative customer sentiment. Our failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Risks Related to Material Sourcing and SupplyFluctuations in the price of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods and negatively impact our financial results.Fluctuations in the price and availability of fuel, labor and raw materials, combined with the inability to mitigate or to pass cost increases on to our customers or to change our merchandise mix as a result of such cost increases, could have an adverse impact on our profitability. Vendors and other suppliers of the Company may experience similar fluctuations, which may subject us to the effects of their price increases. We may or may not be able to pass such costs along to our customers.  Even when successful, attempts to pass such costs along to our customers might cause a decline in our sales volume.  Additionally, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair our ability and the ability of our branded vendors to meet purchasing requirements in a timely manner.  Both the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs.7Table of ContentsThird party suppliers on whom we rely to obtain materials and provide production facilities and other third parties with whom we do business may experience financial difficulties due to current and future economic conditions, which may subject them to insolvency risk or may result in their inability or unwillingness to perform the obligations they owe us. Our suppliers may experience financial difficulties due to a downturn in the industry or in other macroeconomic environments. Our suppliers’ cash and working capital needs can be adversely impacted by the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor. Current and future economic conditions may prevent our suppliers from obtaining financing on favorable terms, which could impact their ability to supply us with merchandise on a timely basis.We are also party to contractual and business relationships with various other parties, including vendors and service providers, pursuant to which such parties owe performance, payment and other obligations to us. In some cases, we depend upon such third parties to provide essential products, services or other benefits, such as advertising, software development and support, logistics and other goods and services necessary to operate our business.  Economic, industry and market conditions could result in increased risks to us associated with the potential financial distress of such third parties.If any of the third parties with which we do business become subject to insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, our rights and benefits in relation to, contractual and business relationships with such third parties could be terminated, modified in a manner adverse to us, or otherwise materially impaired.  There can be no assurances that we would be able to arrange for alternate or replacement contractual or business relationships on terms as favorable as our existing ones, if at all.  Any inability on our part to do so could negatively affect our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.The Company and third-party suppliers on whom we rely source a significant portion of the merchandise we sell from foreign countries, which exposes us to certain risks that include political and economic conditions and supply chain disruptions.Political discourse in the United States continues to focus on ways to discourage corporations in the United States from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions. Since 2018, the United States has imposed additional tariffs on certain items sourced from foreign countries, including China, and has modified, withdrawn from and renegotiated some of its trade agreements with foreign countries. While recent tariffs and modifications to trade agreements have not resulted in a material impact on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations, any additional actions, if ultimately enacted, could negatively impact our ability and the ability of our third-party vendors and suppliers to source products from foreign jurisdictions and could lead to an increase in the cost of goods and adversely affect our profitability.Other trade restrictions imposed by the United States government, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as United States or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us or may require us to modify our current business practices, any of which could adversely affect our profitability.  For example, in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2021, the United States Government took significant steps to address the forced labor concerns in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China, including withhold release orders (“WROs"") issued by United States Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”).  The WROs allow CBP to detain and deny entry of imports suspected of containing cotton from Xinjiang, regardless of the origin of the finished products. This in turn may have an effect on global supply chains, including our own supply chains for cotton-containing products.Our timely receipt of merchandise in the United States is dependent on an efficient global supply chain.  Disruptions in the supply chain could adversely impact our ability to obtain adequate inventory on a timely basis and result in lost sales, increased costs and an overall decrease in our profits.  For example, many disruptions in the global transportation network have occurred in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2021 due to the impact of COVID-19 and other factors.  The California ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which together handle a significant portion of United States merchandise imports including our own imports, have experienced and are expected to continue experiencing delays in processing imported merchandise, thereby resulting in untimely deliveries of merchandise and additional freight costs.Moreover, our third-party suppliers in foreign jurisdictions are subject to political and economic uncertainty. As a result, we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with changing economic and political conditions in foreign countries where our suppliers are located, including increased import duties, tariffs, trade restrictions and quotas; human rights concerns; working conditions and other labor rights and conditions; the environmental impact in foreign countries where merchandise is produced and raw materials or products are sourced; adverse foreign government regulations; wars, fears of war, terrorist attacks and organizing activities; adverse fluctuations of foreign currencies; and political unrest. We cannot predict when, or the extent to which, the countries in which our products are manufactured will experience any of the foregoing events. Any event causing a disruption or delay of imports from foreign locations would likely increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us and would adversely affect our operating results. 8Table of ContentsFailure by third party suppliers to comply with our supplier compliance programs or applicable laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.All of our suppliers must comply with our supplier compliance programs and applicable laws, including consumer and product safety laws, but we do not control our vendors or their labor and business practices. The violation of labor or other laws by one or more of our vendors could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, although we diversify our sourcing and production, the failure of any supplier to produce and deliver our goods on time, to meet our quality standards and adhere to our product safety requirements or to meet the requirements of our supplier compliance program or applicable laws, could impact our ability to flow merchandise to our stores or directly to consumers in the right quantities at the right time, which could adversely affect our profitability and could result in damage to our reputation and translate into sales losses.Risks Related to our Long-Term Marketing and Servicing AllianceReductions in the income and cash flow from our long-term marketing and servicing alliance related to the private label credit cards could impact operating results and cash flows.Wells Fargo owns and manages the private label credit cards under the Wells Fargo Alliance. The Wells Fargo Alliance provides for certain payments to be made by Wells Fargo to the Company, including the Company's share of earnings under this alliance. The income and cash flow that the Company receives from the Wells Fargo Alliance is dependent upon a number of factors including the level of sales on Wells Fargo accounts, the level of balances carried on the Wells Fargo accounts by Wells Fargo customers, payment rates on Wells Fargo accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on Wells Fargo accounts, the level of credit losses for the Wells Fargo accounts, Wells Fargo's ability to extend credit to our customers as well as the cost of customer rewards programs, all of which can vary based on changes in federal and state banking and consumer protection laws and from a variety of economic, legal, social and other factors that we cannot control. If the income or cash flow that the Company receives from the Wells Fargo Alliance decreases, our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.Credit card operations are subject to numerous federal and state laws that impose disclosure and other requirements upon the origination, servicing, and enforcement of credit accounts, and limitations on the amount of finance charges and fees that may be charged by a credit card provider. Wells Fargo may be subject to regulations that may adversely impact its operation of the private label credit card. To the extent that such limitations or regulations materially limit the availability of credit or increase the cost of credit to the cardholders or negatively impact provisions which affect our earnings associated with the private label credit card, our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in credit card use, payment patterns, or default rates could be affected by a variety of economic, legal, social, or other factors over which we have no control and cannot predict with certainty. Such changes could also negatively impact Wells Fargo's ability to facilitate consumer credit or increase the cost of credit to the cardholders.The Wells Fargo Alliance expires in November 2024. If, when the Wells Fargo Alliance expires, Wells Fargo is unable or unwilling to renew and continue owning and managing our proprietary credit cards on similar terms and conditions as exist today or we are unable to quickly and adequately contract with a comparable replacement vendor, then our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected due to a decrease in credit card sales to our cardholding customers and a loss of revenues attributable to payments from Wells Fargo.We are subject to customer payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations.We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, debit cards, credit cards (including the private label credit cards), gift cards and other alternative payment channels. As a result, we are subject to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems.The regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs or accelerate these costs. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which could increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could disrupt our business.9Table of ContentsRisks Related to Information Technology and Information Security RisksA privacy breach could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial condition.We receive and store certain personal information about our employees and our customers, including information permitting cashless payments, both in our stores and through our online operations at dillards.com. In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks.We have a longstanding Information Security Program committed to regular risk assessment and risk mitigation practices surrounding the protection of confidential data. This program includes network segmentation along with identity and access controls around the computer resources that house confidential data as well as encryption and tokenization of credit card data.  We continue to evaluate the security environment surrounding the handling and control of our critical data, especially the private data we receive from our customers, and we regularly institute additional measures to help protect us from a potential privacy breach. Despite our security measures, it is possible that unauthorized persons (through cyberattacks, which are evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, physical breach or other means) might defeat our security measures, those of Wells Fargo or of our other third-party service providers or vendors, and obtain personal information of customers, employees or others. While we likewise have measures in place to prevent exposing the personal information of customers, employees or others, we are at continued risk for exposure of such information. We have purchased Cyber Risk Liability insurance to provide some financial protection should a privacy breach occur; however, such a compromise, whether in our information security system or our third-party service providers or vendors, resulting in personal information being obtained by or exposed to unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. For example, customers have an increasingly high expectation that companies will adequately protect their personal information from security breaches or cyberattacks and unauthorized exposure. Our reputation and our ability to attract new customers could be materially adversely impacted if we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to properly prevent and respond to these incidents. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations.  A security breach also could result in a violation attributable to the Company of applicable U.S. and international privacy and other laws, and subject us to litigation by private customers, business partners, or securities litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability.  The regulatory environment surrounding information security, cybersecurity, and privacy is increasingly demanding, with new and changing requirements, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act. Security breaches, cyber incidents or allegations that we used personal information in violation of applicable privacy and other laws could result in significant legal and financial exposure.Our operations are dependent on information technology systems, and disruptions in those systems could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Our operations are dependent upon the integrity, security and consistent operation of various systems and data centers, including the point-of-sale systems in the stores, our Internet website, data centers that process transactions, communication systems and various software applications used throughout our Company to track inventory flow, process transactions and generate performance and financial reports. The Company's computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyberattack or other security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by the Company's employees. If the Company's computer systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the Company may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and the Company may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in its operations in the interim. Any material interruption in the Company's computer systems could adversely affect its business or results of operations. Additionally, to keep pace with changing technology, we must continuously provide for the design and implementation of new information technology systems and enhancements of our existing systems. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems or maintaining and upgrading existing systems. Such difficulties could lead to significant expenses or to losses due to disruption in business operations.Legal and Compliance RisksLitigation with customers, employees and others could harm our reputation and impact operating results.In the ordinary course of business, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions. We are impacted by trends in litigation, including, but not limited to, class-action allegations brought under various consumer protection, employment and 10Table of Contentsprivacy and information security laws. Additionally, we may be subject to employment-related claims alleging discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and wage issues, including those relating to overtime compensation. We are susceptible to claims filed by customers alleging responsibility for injury suffered during a visit to a store or from product defects and to lawsuits filed by patent holders alleging patent infringement. We are also subject to claims filed under our employee stock ownership plan alleging failure to properly manage the plan.  These types of claims, as well as other types of lawsuits to which we are subject from time to time, can distract management's attention from core business operations and impact operating results, particularly if a lawsuit results in an unfavorable outcome.Risks Related to Construction OperationsThe cost-to-cost method of accounting that we use to recognize contract revenues for our construction segment may result in material adjustments, which could result in a credit or a charge against our earnings.Our construction segment recognizes contract revenues based on the cost-to-cost method.  Under this method, estimated contract revenues are measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs. Estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined. Total contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum on a quarterly basis as the work progresses and as change orders are approved. Adjustments are reflected in contract revenues in the period when these estimates are revised. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we are required to recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material.Risks Related to EmployeesThe Company depends on its ability to attract and retain quality employees, and failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy and our operating results.The Company's business is dependent upon attracting and retaining quality employees. The Company has a large number of employees, many of whom are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. The Company's ability to meet its labor needs while controlling the costs associated with hiring and training new employees is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, changing demographics, prevailing wage rates and current or future minimum wage and healthcare reform legislation. In addition, as a complex enterprise operating in a highly competitive and challenging business environment, the Company is highly dependent upon management personnel to develop and effectively execute successful business strategies and tactics. Any circumstances that adversely impact the Company's ability to attract, train, develop and retain quality employees throughout the organization could adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations.Increases in employee wages and the cost of employee benefits could impact the Company’s financial results and cash flows.The Company’s expenses relating to employee wages and health benefits are significant.  Increases in employee wages, including the minimum wage, or unfavorable changes in the cost of healthcare benefits could impact the Company’s financial results and cash flows.  Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform have resulted and could continue to result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Due to the breadth and complexity of the U.S. healthcare system, and uncertainty regarding legislative or regulatory changes, the Company is not able to fully determine the impact that future healthcare reform will have on our company sponsored medical plans.11Table of Contents"

Forward-looking statements of the Company involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by the Company and its management as a result of a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.The COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on public health, our supply chain, the health and well-being of our employees and customers, and the retail industry in general could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.            In December 2019, a strain of coronavirus, now known as COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. Since that time, the virus has rapidly spread to other countries around the world, including South Korea, Japan, Italy, and recently, the United States. In response to the pandemic, national and local governments have taken various measures to attempt to slow the spread of the virus. These measures include travel bans; prohibitions on group events and large gatherings; extended shutdowns of schools, government offices and certain businesses; curfews and recommendations to practice “social distancing.” At this time, it is unclear how long these measures may remain in place or what additional measures may be imposed.            The foregoing measures, and additional measures that have been and may continue to be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including mandatory or voluntary store closures by the Company, have substantially decreased  and may continue to decrease the number of customers that visit our stores and the shopping malls in which our stores are located. A decrease in customers due to the COVID-19 pandemic or measures taken in response thereto has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business.            The Company sources a significant portion of its private label and exclusive brand merchandise from countries that have experienced widespread transmission of the virus, including China. Additionally, many of the Company’s branded merchandise vendors may also source a significant portion of their merchandise from these same countries.  Manufacturing capacity in those countries has been materially impacted by the pandemic, and has negatively impacted our supply chain. If this continues, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to locate alternative sources of supply for our merchandise on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to adequately source our merchandise or purchase appropriate amounts of merchandise from branded vendors, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.            In the event that the Company were to experience widespread transmission of the virus at one or more of the Company’s stores or other facilities, the Company could suffer reputational harm or other potential liability. Further, the Company’s business operations may be materially and adversely affected if a significant number of the Company’s employees are impacted by the virus.The retail merchandise business is highly competitive, and that competition could lower our revenues, margins and market share.We conduct our retail merchandise business under highly competitive conditions. Competition is characterized by many factors including location, reputation, fashion, merchandise assortment, advertising, operating efficiency, price, quality, customer service and credit availability. We have numerous competitors nationally, locally and on the Internet, including conventional department stores, specialty retailers, off-price and discount stores, boutiques, mass merchants, and Internet and mail-order retailers. Although we are a large regional department store, some of our competitors are larger than us with greater financial resources and, as a result, may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting and selling their products. Additionally, we compete in certain markets with a substantial number of retailers that specialize in one or more types of merchandise that we sell. In recent years, competition has intensified as a result of reduced discretionary consumer spending, increased promotional activity, deep price discounting, and few barriers to entry. Also, online retail shopping continues to rapidly evolve, and we continue to expect competition in the e-commerce market to intensify in the future as the Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping. We anticipate that intense competition will continue from both existing competitors and new entrants. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for products, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share.3Table of ContentsChanges in economic, financial and political conditions, and the resulting impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The retail merchandise business is highly sensitive to changes in overall economic and political conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending. Various economic conditions affect the level of disposable income consumers have available to spend on the merchandise we offer, including unemployment rates, interest rates, taxation, energy costs, the availability of consumer credit, the price of gasoline, consumer confidence in future economic conditions and general business conditions. Due to the Company's concentration of stores in energy producing regions, volatile conditions in these regions could adversely affect the Company's sales. Consumer purchases of discretionary items and other retail products generally decline during recessionary periods, and also may decline at other times when changes in consumer spending patterns affect us unfavorably. In addition, any significant decreases in shopping mall traffic could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Our business is dependent upon our ability to accurately predict rapidly changing fashion trends, customer preferences, and other fashion-related factors.Our sales and operating results depend in part on our ability to effectively predict and quickly respond to changes in fashion trends and customer preferences. We continuously assess emerging styles and trends and focus on developing a merchandise assortment to meet customer preferences at competitive prices. Even with these efforts, we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully meet constantly changing fashion trends and customer preferences. If we are unable to successfully predict or respond to changing styles or preferences, we may be faced with lower sales, increased inventories, additional markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow-moving inventory, and lower gross margins, all of which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our failure to protect our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business.We offer our customers quality products at competitive prices and a high level of customer service, resulting in a well-recognized brand and customer loyalty. As discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor, our brand and customer loyalty depend, in part, on our ability to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. Failure to respond rapidly to changing trends could diminish brand and customer loyalty and impact our reputation with customers.Additionally, the value of our reputation is based, in part, on subjective perceptions of the quality of our merchandise selections. Isolated incidents involving us or our merchandise that erode trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and our business, particularly if the incidents result in significant adverse publicity or governmental investigation or inquiry. Similarly, information posted about us, including our lines of exclusive brand merchandise, on the Internet, including social media platforms that allow individuals access to a wide audience of consumers and other interested persons, may adversely affect our reputation, even if the information is inaccurate. Any significant damage to our brand or reputation could negatively impact sales, diminish customer trust and generate negative sentiment, any of which would harm our business and results of operation.Risks associated with our private label merchandise program could adversely affect our business. Our merchandise selections include our lines of exclusive brand merchandise, such as Antonio Melani, Gianni Bini, GB, Roundtree & Yorke and Daniel Cremieux. We expect to grow our private label merchandise program and have invested in our development and procurement resources and marketing efforts related to these exclusive brand offerings. The expansion of our private label merchandise subjects us to certain additional risks. These include, among others, risks related to: our failure to comply with government and industry safety standards; our ability to successfully protect our trademark and license portfolio and our other  proprietary rights in our exclusive brands/private label merchandise program; and risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing. In addition, damage to the reputation of our private label trade names may generate negative customer sentiment. Our failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Fluctuations in the price of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods and negatively impact our financial results.Fluctuations in the price and availability of fuel, labor and raw materials, combined with the inability to mitigate or to pass cost increases on to our customers or to change our merchandise mix as a result of such cost increases, could have an adverse impact on our profitability. Vendors and other suppliers of the Company may experience similar fluctuations, which may subject us to the effects of their price increases. We may or may not be able to pass such costs along to our customers.  4Table of ContentsEven when successful, attempts to pass such costs along to our customers might cause a decline in our sales volume.  Additionally, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair our ability and the ability of our branded vendors to meet purchasing requirements in a timely manner.  Both the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs.Third party suppliers on whom we rely to obtain materials and provide production facilities and other third parties with whom we do business may experience financial difficulties due to current and future economic conditions, which may subject them to insolvency risk or may result in their inability or unwillingness to perform the obligations they owe us. Our suppliers may experience financial difficulties due to a downturn in the industry or in other macroeconomic environments. Our suppliers’ cash and working capital needs can be adversely impacted by the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor. Current and future economic conditions may prevent our suppliers from obtaining financing on favorable terms, which could impact their ability to supply us with merchandise on a timely basis.We are also party to contractual and business relationships with various other parties, including vendors and service providers, pursuant to which such parties owe performance, payment and other obligations to us. In some cases, we depend upon such third parties to provide essential products, services or other benefits, such as advertising, software development and support, logistics and other goods and services necessary to operate our business.  Economic, industry and market conditions could result in increased risks to us associated with the potential financial distress of such third parties.If any of the third parties with which we do business become subject to insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, our rights and benefits in relation to, contractual and business relationships with such third parties could be terminated, modified in a manner adverse to us, or otherwise materially impaired.  There can be no assurances that we would be able to arrange for alternate or replacement contractual or business relationships on terms as favorable as our existing ones, if at all.  Any inability on our part to do so could negatively affect our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.We source many of our products from foreign countries, which exposes us to certain risks that include political and economic conditions.Political discourse has recently focused on ways to discourage corporations in the United States from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions. In 2018, the United States imposed additional tariffs on certain items sourced from foreign countries, including China. Other proposals to address this issue include the possibility of imposing additional tariffs, border adjustments or other penalties on goods manufactured outside the United States to attempt to discourage these practices. It has also been suggested that the United States may materially modify or withdraw from some of its existing trade agreements. While recent tariffs have not resulted in a material impact on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations, any additional actions, if ultimately enacted, could negatively impact our ability and the ability of our third-party vendors and suppliers to source products from foreign jurisdictions and could lead to an increase in the cost of goods and adversely affect our profitability.Moreover, our third-party suppliers in foreign jurisdictions are subject to political and economic uncertainty. As a result, we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with changing economic and political conditions in foreign countries where our suppliers are located, including increased import duties, tariffs, trade restrictions and quotas, work stoppages, economic uncertainties, human rights concerns, working conditions and other labor rights and conditions, the environmental impact in foreign countries where merchandise is produced and raw materials or products are sourced, changing labor, environmental and other laws in these countries, adverse foreign government regulations, wars, fears of war, terrorist attacks and organizing activities, adverse fluctuations of foreign currencies and political unrest.  We cannot predict when, or the extent to which, the countries in which our products are manufactured will experience any of the foregoing events. Any event causing a disruption or delay of imports from foreign locations would likely increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us and would adversely affect our operating results. In addition, trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as United States or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us or may require us to modify our current business practices, any of which could adversely affect our profitability.Failure by third party suppliers to comply with our supplier compliance programs or applicable laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.All of our suppliers must comply with our supplier compliance programs and applicable laws, including consumer and product safety laws, but we do not control our vendors or their labor and business practices. The violation of labor or other laws by one or more of our vendors could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, although we diversify our sourcing 5Table of Contentsand production, the failure of any supplier to produce and deliver our goods on time, to meet our quality standards and adhere to our product safety requirements or to meet the requirements of our supplier compliance program or applicable laws, could impact our ability to flow merchandise to our stores or directly to consumers in the right quantities at the right time, which could adversely affect our profitability and could result in damage to our reputation and translate into sales losses.A decrease in cash flows from our operations and constraints to accessing other financing sources could limit our ability to fund our operations, capital projects, interest and debt repayments, stock repurchases and dividends.Our business depends upon our operations to generate strong cash flow and to some extent upon the availability of financing sources to supply capital to fund our general operating activities, capital projects, interest and debt repayments, stock repurchases and dividends. Our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or the lack of available financing in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed could adversely affect our financial performance including our earnings per share.Reductions in the income and cash flow from our long-term marketing and servicing alliance related to the private label credit cards could impact operating results and cash flows.Wells Fargo owns and manages the private label credit cards under the Wells Fargo Alliance. The Wells Fargo Alliance provides for certain payments to be made by Wells Fargo to the Company, including the Company's share of earnings under this alliance. The income and cash flow that the Company receives from the Wells Fargo Alliance is dependent upon a number of factors including the level of sales on Wells Fargo accounts, the level of balances carried on the Wells Fargo accounts by Wells Fargo customers, payment rates on Wells Fargo accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on Wells Fargo accounts, the level of credit losses for the Wells Fargo accounts, Wells Fargo's ability to extend credit to our customers as well as the cost of customer rewards programs, all of which can vary based on changes in federal and state banking and consumer protection laws and from a variety of economic, legal, social and other factors that we cannot control. If the income or cash flow that the Company receives from the Wells Fargo Alliance decreases, our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.Credit card operations are subject to numerous federal and state laws that impose disclosure and other requirements upon the origination, servicing, and enforcement of credit accounts, and limitations on the amount of finance charges and fees that may be charged by a credit card provider. Wells Fargo may be subject to regulations that may adversely impact its operation of the private label credit card. To the extent that such limitations or regulations materially limit the availability of credit or increase the cost of credit to the cardholders or negatively impact provisions which affect our earnings associated with the private label credit card, our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in credit card use, payment patterns, or default rates could be affected by a variety of economic, legal, social, or other factors over which we have no control and cannot predict with certainty. Such changes could also negatively impact Wells Fargo's ability to facilitate consumer credit or increase the cost of credit to the cardholders.We are subject to customer payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations.We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, debit cards, credit cards (including the private label credit cards) and gift cards. As a result, we are subject to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems.The regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs or accelerate these costs. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which could increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could disrupt our business.Our business is seasonal, and fluctuations in our revenues during the last quarter of our fiscal year can have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations.Our business, like many other retailers, is subject to seasonal influences, with a significant portion of sales and income typically realized during the last quarter of our fiscal year due to the holiday season. Our fiscal fourth-quarter results may fluctuate significantly, based on many factors, including holiday spending patterns and weather conditions, and any such fluctuation could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year. Because of the seasonality 6Table of Contentsof our business, our operating results vary considerably from quarter to quarter, and results from any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.A shutdown of, or disruption in, any of the Company's distribution or fulfillment centers would have an adverse effect on the Company's business and operations.Our business depends on the orderly operation of the process of receiving and distributing merchandise, which relies on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management of distribution or fulfillment centers. Although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient and that we have appropriate contingency plans, unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fire, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements, or other shipping problems may result in the loss of inventory and/or delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and customers.Current store locations may become less desirable, and desirable new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations.In order to generate customer traffic and for convenience of our customers, we attempt to locate our stores in desirable locations within shopping malls and open air centers. Our stores benefit from the abilities that our Company, other anchor tenants and other area attractions have to generate consumer traffic. Adverse changes in the development of new shopping malls in the United States, the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping malls, competition with other retailers for prominent locations, the success of individual shopping malls and the success or failure of other anchor tenants, the continued proper management and development of existing malls, or the continued popularity of shopping malls may continue to impact our ability to maintain or grow our sales in our existing stores, as well as our ability to open new stores, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Ownership and leasing of significant amounts of real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses.We own the land and building, or lease the land and/or the building, for all of our stores. Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks associated with owning and leasing real estate. In particular, the value of our real estate assets could decrease, and their operating costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends and supply or demand for the use of the store, which may result from competition from similar stores in the area.  Additionally, we are subject to potential liability for environmental conditions on the property that we own or lease.  If an existing owned store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be required to record an impairment charge and/or exit costs associated with the disposal of the store. We generally cannot cancel our leases. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be committed to perform certain obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each of the leases expires, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations. We may not be able to close an unprofitable owned store due to an existing operating covenant which may cause us to operate the location at a loss and prevent us from finding a more desirable location. We have approximately 75 stores along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts that are covered by third-party insurance but are self-insured for property and merchandise losses related to ""named storms."" As a result, the repair and replacement costs will be borne by us for damage to any of these stores from ""named storms,"" which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.A privacy breach could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial condition.We receive and store certain personal information about our employees and our customers, including information permitting cashless payments, both in our stores and through our online operations at www.dillards.com. In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks.We have a longstanding Information Security Program committed to regular risk assessment and risk mitigation practices surrounding the protection of confidential data. This program includes network segmentation along with identity and access controls around the computer resources that house confidential data.  We continue to evaluate the security environment surrounding the handling and control of our critical data, especially the private data we receive from our customers, and we institute additional measures to help protect us from a privacy breach. Despite our security measures, it is possible that unauthorized persons (through cyberattacks, which are evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, physical breach or other means) might defeat our security measures, those of Wells Fargo or of our other third-party service providers or vendors, and obtain personal information of customers, employees or others. While we likewise have measures in place to prevent exposing the personal information of customers, employees or others, we are at continued risk for exposure of such information. We have purchased Cyber Risk Liability insurance to provide some financial protection should a privacy breach occur; however, such a compromise, whether in our information security system or our third-party service providers or vendors, 7Table of Contentsresulting in personal information being obtained by or exposed to unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. For example, customers have an increasingly high expectation that companies will adequately protect their personal information from security breaches or cyberattacks and unauthorized exposure. Our reputation and our ability to attract new customers could be materially adversely impacted if we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to properly prevent and respond to these incidents. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations.  A security breach also could result in a violation attributable to the Company of applicable U.S. and international privacy and other laws, and subject us to litigation by private customers, business partners, or securities litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability.  The regulatory environment surrounding information security, cybersecurity, and privacy is increasingly demanding, with new and changing requirements, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act. Security breaches, cyber incidents or allegations that we used personal information in violation of applicable privacy and other laws could result in significant legal and financial exposure.Litigation with customers, employees and others could harm our reputation and impact operating results.In the ordinary course of business, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions. We are impacted by trends in litigation, including, but not limited to, class-action allegations brought under various consumer protection, employment, and privacy and information security laws. Additionally, we may be subject to employment-related claims alleging discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and wage issues, including those relating to overtime compensation. We are susceptible to claims filed by customers alleging responsibility for injury suffered during a visit to a store or from product defects, and we are also subject to lawsuits filed by patent holders alleging patent infringement. These types of claims, as well as other types of lawsuits to which we are subject from time to time, can distract management's attention from core business operations and impact operating results, particularly if a lawsuit results in an unfavorable outcome.Our profitability may be adversely impacted by weather conditions.Our merchandise assortments reflect assumptions regarding expected weather patterns and our profitability depends on our ability to timely deliver seasonally appropriate inventory. Unexpected or unseasonable weather conditions could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with consumer needs. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of the Company's inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions. Additionally, extreme weather or natural disasters, particularly in the areas in which our stores are located, could also severely hinder our ability to timely deliver seasonally appropriate merchandise. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms, hurricanes or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for the Company's customers to travel to its stores and thereby reduce the Company's sales and profitability. A reduction in the demand for or supply of our seasonal merchandise or reduced sales due to reduced customer traffic in our stores could have an adverse effect on our inventory levels, gross margins and results of operations.Natural disasters, war, acts of violence, acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts, and public health issues may adversely impact our business.The occurrence of, or threat of, a natural disaster, war, acts of violence, acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts, and public health issues (including the recent COVID-19 pandemic) could disrupt our operations, disrupt international trade and supply chain efficiencies, suppliers or customers, or result in political or economic instability. If commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted, as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers, fulfillment centers, stores, or directly to customers. As a result of the occurrence of, or threat of, a natural disaster, acts of violence or acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts, and public health issues (including the recent COVID-19 pandemic) in the United States, we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our stores, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Increases in employee wages and the cost of employee benefits could impact the Company’s financial results and cash flows.The Company’s expenses relating to employee wages and health benefits are significant.  Increases in employee wages, including the minimum wage, or unfavorable changes in the cost of healthcare benefits could impact the Company’s financial results and cash flows.  Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform have resulted and could continue to result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Due to the breadth and complexity of the U.S. healthcare system, and uncertainty regarding legislative or regulatory changes, the 8Table of ContentsCompany is not able to fully determine the impact that future healthcare reform will have on our company sponsored medical plans.The Company depends on its ability to attract and retain quality employees, and failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy and our operating results.The Company's business is dependent upon attracting and retaining quality employees. The Company has a large number of employees, many of whom are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. The Company's ability to meet its labor needs while controlling the costs associated with hiring and training new employees is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, changing demographics, prevailing wage rates, and current or future minimum wage and healthcare reform legislation. In addition, as a complex enterprise operating in a highly competitive and challenging business environment, the Company is highly dependent upon management personnel to develop and effectively execute successful business strategies and tactics. Any circumstances that adversely impact the Company's ability to attract, train, develop and retain quality employees throughout the organization could adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations.Variations in the amount of vendor allowances received could adversely impact our operating results.We receive vendor allowances for advertising, payroll and margin maintenance that are a strategic part of our operations. A reduction in the amount of cooperative advertising allowances would likely cause us to consider other methods of advertising as well as the volume and frequency of our product advertising, which could increase/decrease our expenditures and/or revenue. Decreased payroll reimbursements would either cause payroll costs to rise, negatively impacting operating income, or cause us to reduce the number of employees, which may cause a decline in sales. A decline in the amount of margin maintenance allowances would either increase cost of sales, which would negatively impact gross margin and operating income, or cause us to reduce merchandise purchases, which may cause a decline in sales.Our operations are dependent on information technology systems, and disruptions in those systems could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Our operations are dependent upon the integrity, security and consistent operation of various systems and data centers, including the point-of-sale systems in the stores, our Internet website, data centers that process transactions, communication systems and various software applications used throughout our Company to track inventory flow, process transactions and generate performance and financial reports. The Company's computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyberattack or other security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by the Company's employees. If the Company's computer systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the Company may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and the Company may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in its operations in the interim. Any material interruption in the Company's computer systems could adversely affect its business or results of operations. Additionally, to keep pace with changing technology, we must continuously provide for the design and implementation of new information technology systems and enhancements of our existing systems. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems or maintaining and upgrading existing systems. Such difficulties could lead to significant expenses or to losses due to disruption in business operations.The cost-to-cost method of accounting that we use to recognize contract revenues for our construction segment may result in material adjustments, which could result in a credit or a charge against our earnings.Our construction segment recognizes contract revenues based on the cost-to-cost method.  Under this method, estimated contract revenues are measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs. Estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined. Total contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum on a quarterly basis as the work progresses and as change orders are approved. Adjustments are reflected in contract revenues in the period when these estimates are revised. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we are required to recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material.9Table of Contents"

, of this Annual Report could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company cautions that forward-looking statements, as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on estimates, projections, beliefs and assumptions of management at the time of such statements and are not guarantees of future performance. The Company disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements based on the occurrence of future events, the receipt of new information, or otherwise. Forward-looking statements of the Company involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by the Company and its management as a result of a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.The retail merchandise business is highly competitive, and that competition could lower our revenues, margins and market share.We conduct our retail merchandise business under highly competitive conditions. Competition is characterized by many factors including location, reputation, fashion, merchandise assortment, advertising, operating efficiency, price, quality, customer service and credit availability. We have numerous competitors nationally, locally and on the Internet, including conventional department stores, specialty retailers, off-price and discount stores, boutiques, mass merchants, and Internet and mail-order retailers. Although we are a large regional department store, some of our competitors are larger than us with greater financial resources and, as a result, may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting and selling their products. Additionally, we compete in certain markets with a substantial number of retailers that specialize in one or more types of merchandise that we sell. In recent years, competition has intensified as a result of reduced discretionary consumer spending, increased promotional activity, deep price discounting, and few barriers to entry. Also, online retail shopping continues to rapidly evolve, and we continue to expect competition in the e-commerce market to intensify in the future as the Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping. We anticipate that intense competition will continue from both existing competitors and new entrants. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for products, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share.Changes in economic, financial and political conditions, and the resulting impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The retail merchandise business is highly sensitive to changes in overall economic and political conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending. Various economic conditions affect the level of disposable income consumers have available to spend on the merchandise we offer, including unemployment rates, interest rates, taxation, energy costs, the availability of consumer credit, the price of gasoline, consumer confidence in future economic conditions and general business conditions. Due to the Company's concentration of stores in energy producing regions, volatile conditions in these regions could adversely affect the Company's sales. Consumer purchases of discretionary items and other retail products generally decline during recessionary periods, and also may decline at other times when changes in consumer spending patterns affect us unfavorably. In addition, any significant decreases in shopping mall traffic could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Our business is dependent upon our ability to accurately predict rapidly changing fashion trends, customer preferences, and other fashion-related factors.Our sales and operating results depend in part on our ability to effectively predict and quickly respond to changes in fashion trends and customer preferences. We continuously assess emerging styles and trends and focus on developing a merchandise assortment to meet customer preferences at competitive prices. Even with these efforts, we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully meet constantly changing fashion trends and customer preferences. If we are unable to successfully predict or respond to changing styles or preferences, we may be faced with lower sales, increased inventories, additional markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow-moving inventory, and lower gross margins, all of which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 3Table of ContentsOur failure to protect our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business.We offer our customers quality products at competitive prices and a high level of customer service, resulting in a well-recognized brand and customer loyalty. As discussed in the immediately preceding risk factor, our brand and customer loyalty depend, in part, on our ability to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. Failure to respond rapidly to changing trends could diminish brand and customer loyalty and impact our reputation with customers.Additionally, the value of our reputation is based, in part, on subjective perceptions of the quality of our merchandise selections. Isolated incidents involving us or our merchandise that erode trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and our business, particularly if the incidents result in significant adverse publicity or governmental investigation or inquiry. Similarly, information posted about us, including our lines of exclusive brand merchandise, on the Internet, including social media platforms that allow individuals access to a wide audience of consumers and other interested persons, may adversely affect our reputation, even if the information is inaccurate. Any significant damage to our brand or reputation could negatively impact sales, diminish customer trust and generate negative sentiment, any of which would harm our business and results of operation.Risks associated with our private label merchandise program could adversely affect our business. Our merchandise selections include our lines of exclusive brand merchandise, such as Antonio Melani, Gianni Bini, GB, Roundtree & Yorke and Daniel Cremieux. We expect to grow our private label merchandise program and have invested in our development and procurement resources and marketing efforts related to these exclusive brand offerings. The expansion of our private label merchandise subjects us to certain additional risks. These include, among others, risks related to: our failure to comply with government and industry safety standards; our ability to successfully protect our trademark and license portfolio and our other  proprietary rights in our exclusive brands/private label merchandise program; and risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing. In addition, damage to the reputation of our private label trade names may generate negative customer sentiment. Our failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Fluctuations in the price of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods and negatively impact our financial results.Fluctuations in the price and availability of fuel, labor and raw materials, combined with the inability to mitigate or to pass cost increases on to our customers or to change our merchandise mix as a result of such cost increases, could have an adverse impact on our profitability. Vendors and other suppliers of the Company may experience similar fluctuations, which may subject us to the effects of their price increases. We may or may not be able to pass such costs along to our customers.  Even when successful, attempts to pass such costs along to our customers might cause a decline in our sales volume.  Additionally, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair our ability and the ability of our branded vendors to meet purchasing requirements in a timely manner.  Both the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs.Third party suppliers on whom we rely to obtain materials and provide production facilities and other third parties with whom we do business may experience financial difficulties due to current and future economic conditions, which may subject them to insolvency risk or may result in their inability or unwillingness to perform the obligations they owe us. Our suppliers may experience financial difficulties due to a downturn in the industry or in other macroeconomic environments. Our suppliers’ cash and working capital needs can be adversely impacted by the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor. Current and future economic conditions may prevent our suppliers from obtaining financing on favorable terms, which could impact their ability to supply us with merchandise on a timely basis.We are also party to contractual and business relationships with various other parties, including vendors and service providers, pursuant to which such parties owe performance, payment and other obligations to us. In some cases, we depend upon such third parties to provide essential products, services or other benefits, such as advertising, software development and support, logistics and other goods and services necessary to operate our business.  Economic, industry and market conditions could result in increased risks to us associated with the potential financial distress of such third parties.If any of the third parties with which we do business become subject to insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, our rights and benefits in relation to, contractual and business relationships with such third parties could be terminated, modified in a manner adverse to us, or otherwise materially impaired.  There can be no assurances that we would be 4Table of Contentsable to arrange for alternate or replacement contractual or business relationships on terms as favorable as our existing ones, if at all.  Any inability on our part to do so could negatively affect our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.We source many of our products from foreign countries, which exposes us to certain risks that include political and economic conditions.Political discourse has recently focused on ways to discourage corporations in the United States from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions. In 2018, the United States imposed additional tariffs on certain items sourced from foreign countries, including China. Other proposals to address this issue include the possibility of imposing additional tariffs, border adjustments or other penalties on goods manufactured outside the United States to attempt to discourage these practices. It has also been suggested that the United States may materially modify or withdraw from some of its existing trade agreements. While recent tariffs have not resulted in a material impact on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations, any additional actions, if ultimately enacted, could negatively impact our ability and the ability of our third-party vendors and suppliers to source products from foreign jurisdictions and could lead to an increase in the cost of goods and adversely affect our profitability.Moreover, our third-party suppliers in foreign jurisdictions are subject to political and economic uncertainty. As a result, we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with changing economic and political conditions in foreign countries where our suppliers are located, including increased import duties, tariffs, trade restrictions and quotas, work stoppages, economic uncertainties, human rights concerns, working conditions and other labor rights and conditions, the environmental impact in foreign countries where merchandise is produced and raw materials or products are sourced, changing labor, environmental and other laws in these countries, adverse foreign government regulations, wars, fears of war, terrorist attacks and organizing activities, adverse fluctuations of foreign currencies and political unrest.  We cannot predict when, or the extent to which, the countries in which our products are manufactured will experience any of the foregoing events. Any event causing a disruption or delay of imports from foreign locations would likely increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us and would adversely affect our operating results. In addition, trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as United States or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us or may require us to modify our current business practices, any of which could adversely affect our profitability.Failure by third party suppliers to comply with our supplier compliance programs or applicable laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.All of our suppliers must comply with our supplier compliance programs and applicable laws, including consumer and product safety laws, but we do not control our vendors or their labor and business practices. The violation of labor or other laws by one or more of our vendors could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, although we diversify our sourcing and production, the failure of any supplier to produce and deliver our goods on time, to meet our quality standards and adhere to our product safety requirements or to meet the requirements of our supplier compliance program or applicable laws, could impact our ability to flow merchandise to our stores or directly to consumers in the right quantities at the right time, which could adversely affect our profitability and could result in damage to our reputation and translate into sales losses.A decrease in cash flows from our operations and constraints to accessing other financing sources could limit our ability to fund our operations, capital projects, interest and debt repayments, stock repurchases and dividends.Our business depends upon our operations to generate strong cash flow and to some extent upon the availability of financing sources to supply capital to fund our general operating activities, capital projects, interest and debt repayments, stock repurchases and dividends. Our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or the lack of available financing in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed could adversely affect our financial performance including our earnings per share.Reductions in the income and cash flow from our long-term marketing and servicing alliance related to the private label credit cards could impact operating results and cash flows.Wells Fargo owns and manages the private label credit cards under the Wells Fargo Alliance. The Wells Fargo Alliance provides for certain payments to be made by Wells Fargo to the Company, including the Company's share of earnings under this alliance. The income and cash flow that the Company receives from the Wells Fargo Alliance is dependent upon a number of factors including the level of sales on Wells Fargo accounts, the level of balances carried on the Wells Fargo accounts by Wells Fargo customers, payment rates on Wells Fargo accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on Wells Fargo accounts, the level of credit losses for the Wells Fargo accounts, Wells Fargo's ability to extend credit to our customers as well as the cost of customer rewards programs, all of which can vary based on changes in federal and state banking and consumer protection laws 5Table of Contentsand from a variety of economic, legal, social and other factors that we cannot control. If the income or cash flow that the Company receives from the Wells Fargo Alliance decreases, our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.Credit card operations are subject to numerous federal and state laws that impose disclosure and other requirements upon the origination, servicing, and enforcement of credit accounts, and limitations on the amount of finance charges and fees that may be charged by a credit card provider. Wells Fargo may be subject to regulations that may adversely impact its operation of the private label credit card. To the extent that such limitations or regulations materially limit the availability of credit or increase the cost of credit to the cardholders or negatively impact provisions which affect our earnings associated with the private label credit card, our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in credit card use, payment patterns, or default rates could be affected by a variety of economic, legal, social, or other factors over which we have no control and cannot predict with certainty. Such changes could also negatively impact Wells Fargo's ability to facilitate consumer credit or increase the cost of credit to the cardholders.We are subject to customer payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations.We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, debit cards, credit cards (including the private label credit cards) and gift cards. As a result, we are subject to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems.The regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs or accelerate these costs. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which could increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could disrupt our business.Our business is seasonal, and fluctuations in our revenues during the last quarter of our fiscal year can have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations.Our business, like many other retailers, is subject to seasonal influences, with a significant portion of sales and income typically realized during the last quarter of our fiscal year due to the holiday season. Our fiscal fourth-quarter results may fluctuate significantly, based on many factors, including holiday spending patterns and weather conditions, and any such fluctuation could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year. Because of the seasonality of our business, our operating results vary considerably from quarter to quarter, and results from any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.A shutdown of, or disruption in, any of the Company's distribution or fulfillment centers would have an adverse effect on the Company's business and operations.Our business depends on the orderly operation of the process of receiving and distributing merchandise, which relies on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management of distribution or fulfillment centers. Although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient and that we have appropriate contingency plans, unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fire, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements, or other shipping problems may result in the loss of inventory and/or delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and customers.Current store locations may become less desirable, and desirable new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations.In order to generate customer traffic and for convenience of our customers, we attempt to locate our stores in desirable locations within shopping malls and open air centers. Our stores benefit from the abilities that our Company, other anchor tenants and other area attractions have to generate consumer traffic. Adverse changes in the development of new shopping malls in the United States, the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping malls, competition with other retailers for prominent locations, the success of individual shopping malls and the success or failure of other anchor tenants, the continued proper management and development of existing malls, or the continued popularity of shopping malls may continue to impact our ability to maintain or grow our sales in our existing stores, as well as our ability to open new stores, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.6Table of ContentsOwnership and leasing of significant amounts of real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses.We own the land and building, or lease the land and/or the building, for all of our stores. Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks associated with owning and leasing real estate. In particular, the value of our real estate assets could decrease, and their operating costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends and supply or demand for the use of the store, which may result from competition from similar stores in the area.  Additionally, we are subject to potential liability for environmental conditions on the property that we own or lease.  If an existing owned store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be required to record an impairment charge and/or exit costs associated with the disposal of the store. We generally cannot cancel our leases. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be committed to perform certain obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each of the leases expires, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations. We may not be able to close an unprofitable owned store due to an existing operating covenant which may cause us to operate the location at a loss and prevent us from finding a more desirable location. We have approximately 75 stores along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts that are covered by third-party insurance but are self-insured for property and merchandise losses related to ""named storms."" As a result, the repair and replacement costs will be borne by us for damage to any of these stores from ""named storms,"" which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.A privacy breach could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial condition.We receive and store certain personal information about our employees and our customers, including information permitting cashless payments, both in our stores and through our online operations at www.dillards.com. In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks.We have a longstanding Information Security Program committed to regular risk assessment and risk mitigation practices surrounding the protection of confidential data. This program includes network segmentation along with identity and access controls around the computer resources that house confidential data.  We continue to evaluate the security environment surrounding the handling and control of our critical data, especially the private data we receive from our customers, and we institute additional measures to help protect us from a privacy breach. Despite our security measures, it is possible that unauthorized persons (through cyberattacks, which are evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, physical breach or other means) might defeat our security measures, those of Wells Fargo or of our other third-party service providers or vendors, and obtain personal information of customers, employees or others. While we likewise have measures in place to prevent exposing the personal information of customers, employees or others, we are at continued risk for exposure of such information. We have purchased Cyber Risk Liability insurance to provide some financial protection should a privacy breach occur; however, such a compromise, whether in our information security system or our third-party service providers or vendors, resulting in personal information being obtained by or exposed to unauthorized persons could adversely affect our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. For example, customers have an increasingly high expectation that companies will adequately protect their personal information from security breaches or cyberattacks and unauthorized exposure. Our reputation and our ability to attract new customers could be materially adversely impacted if we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to properly prevent and respond to these incidents. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations.  A security breach also could result in a violation attributable to the Company of applicable U.S. and international privacy and other laws, and subject us to litigation by private customers, business partners, or securities litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability.  The regulatory environment surrounding information security, cybersecurity, and privacy is increasingly demanding, with new and changing requirements, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act. Security breaches, cyber incidents or allegations that we used personal information in violation of applicable privacy and other laws could result in significant legal and financial exposure.Litigation with customers, employees and others could harm our reputation and impact operating results.In the ordinary course of business, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions. We are impacted by trends in litigation, including, but not limited to, class-action allegations brought under various consumer protection, employment, and privacy and information security laws. Additionally, we may be subject to employment-related claims alleging discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and wage issues, including those relating to overtime compensation. We are susceptible to claims filed by customers alleging responsibility for injury suffered during a visit to a store or from product defects, and we are also subject to lawsuits filed by patent holders alleging patent infringement. These types of claims, as well as other types of 7Table of Contentslawsuits to which we are subject from time to time, can distract management's attention from core business operations and impact operating results, particularly if a lawsuit results in an unfavorable outcome.Our profitability may be adversely impacted by weather conditions.Our merchandise assortments reflect assumptions regarding expected weather patterns and our profitability depends on our ability to timely deliver seasonally appropriate inventory. Unexpected or unseasonable weather conditions could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with consumer needs. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of the Company's inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions. Additionally, extreme weather or natural disasters, particularly in the areas in which our stores are located, could also severely hinder our ability to timely deliver seasonally appropriate merchandise. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms, hurricanes or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for the Company's customers to travel to its stores and thereby reduce the Company's sales and profitability. A reduction in the demand for or supply of our seasonal merchandise or reduced sales due to reduced customer traffic in our stores could have an adverse effect on our inventory levels, gross margins and results of operations.Natural disasters, war, acts of violence, acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts, and public health issues may adversely impact our business.The occurrence of, or threat of, a natural disaster, war, acts of violence, acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts, and public health issues could disrupt our operations, disrupt international trade and supply chain efficiencies, suppliers or customers, or result in political or economic instability. If commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted, as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers, fulfillment centers, stores, or directly to customers. As a result of the occurrence of, or threat of, a natural disaster, acts of violence or acts of terrorism in the United States, we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our stores, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Increases in employee wages and the cost of employee benefits could impact the Company’s financial results and cash flows.The Company’s expenses relating to employee wages and health benefits are significant.  Increases in employee wages, including the minimum wage, or unfavorable changes in the cost of healthcare benefits could impact the Company’s financial results and cash flows.  Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform have resulted and could continue to result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Due to the breadth and complexity of the U.S. healthcare system, and uncertainty regarding legislative or regulatory changes, the Company is not able to fully determine the impact that future healthcare reform will have on our company sponsored medical plans.The Company depends on its ability to attract and retain quality employees, and failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy and our operating results.The Company's business is dependent upon attracting and retaining quality employees. The Company has a large number of employees, many of whom are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. The Company's ability to meet its labor needs while controlling the costs associated with hiring and training new employees is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, changing demographics, prevailing wage rates, and current or future minimum wage and healthcare reform legislation. In addition, as a complex enterprise operating in a highly competitive and challenging business environment, the Company is highly dependent upon management personnel to develop and effectively execute successful business strategies and tactics. Any circumstances that adversely impact the Company's ability to attract, train, develop and retain quality employees throughout the organization could adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations.Variations in the amount of vendor allowances received could adversely impact our operating results.We receive vendor allowances for advertising, payroll and margin maintenance that are a strategic part of our operations. A reduction in the amount of cooperative advertising allowances would likely cause us to consider other methods of advertising as well as the volume and frequency of our product advertising, which could increase/decrease our expenditures and/or revenue. Decreased payroll reimbursements would either cause payroll costs to rise, negatively impacting operating income, or cause us to reduce the number of employees, which may cause a decline in sales. A decline in the amount of margin maintenance allowances would either increase cost of sales, which would negatively impact gross margin and operating income, or cause us to reduce merchandise purchases, which may cause a decline in sales.8Table of ContentsOur operations are dependent on information technology systems, and disruptions in those systems could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Our operations are dependent upon the integrity, security and consistent operation of various systems and data centers, including the point-of-sale systems in the stores, our Internet website, data centers that process transactions, communication systems and various software applications used throughout our Company to track inventory flow, process transactions and generate performance and financial reports. The Company's computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyberattack or other security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by the Company's employees. If the Company's computer systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the Company may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and the Company may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in its operations in the interim. Any material interruption in the Company's computer systems could adversely affect its business or results of operations. Additionally, to keep pace with changing technology, we must continuously provide for the design and implementation of new information technology systems and enhancements of our existing systems. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems or maintaining and upgrading existing systems. Such difficulties could lead to significant expenses or to losses due to disruption in business operations.The cost-to-cost method of accounting that we use to recognize contract revenues for our construction segment may result in material adjustments, which could result in a credit or a charge against our earnings.Our construction segment recognizes contract revenues based on the cost-to-cost method.  Under this method, estimated contract revenues are measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs. Estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined. Total contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum on a quarterly basis as the work progresses and as change orders are approved. Adjustments are reflected in contract revenues in the period when these estimates are revised. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we are required to recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material.9Table of Contents"
8,DDS,DILLARDS INC  -CL A,2018-03-30,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS.The risks described in this Item 1A, Risk Factors
, of this Annual Report could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company cautions that forward-looking statements, as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on estimates, projections, beliefs and assumptions of management at the time of such statements and are not guarantees of future performance. The Company disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements based on the occurrence of future events, the receipt of new information, or otherwise. Forward-looking statements of the Company involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by the Company and its management as a result of a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.The retail merchandise business is highly competitive, and that competition could lower our revenues, margins and market share.We conduct our retail merchandise business under highly competitive conditions. Competition is characterized by many factors including location, reputation, fashion, merchandise assortment, advertising, operating efficiency, price, quality, customer service and credit availability. We have numerous competitors nationally, locally and on the Internet, including conventional department stores, specialty retailers, off-price and discount stores, boutiques, mass merchants, and Internet and mail-order retailers. Although we are a large regional department store, some of our competitors are larger than us with greater financial resources and, as a result, may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting and selling their products. Additionally, we compete in certain markets with a substantial number of retailers that specialize in one or more types of merchandise that we sell. In recent years, competition has intensified as a result of reduced discretionary consumer spending, increased promotional activity, deep price discounting, and few barriers to entry. Also, online retail shopping continues to rapidly evolve, and we continue to expect competition in the e-commerce market to intensify in the future as the Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping. We anticipate that intense competition will continue from both existing competitors and new entrants. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for products, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share.Changes in economic, financial and political conditions, and the resulting impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The retail merchandise business is highly sensitive to changes in overall economic and political conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending. Various economic conditions affect the level of disposable income consumers have available to spend on the merchandise we offer, including unemployment rates, interest rates, taxation, energy costs, the availability of consumer credit, the price of gasoline, consumer confidence in future economic conditions and general business conditions. Due to the Company's concentration of stores in energy producing regions, volatile conditions in these regions could adversely affect the Company's sales. Consumer purchases of discretionary items and other retail products generally decline during recessionary periods, and also may decline at other times when changes in consumer spending patterns affect us unfavorably. In addition, any significant decreases in shopping mall traffic could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Our business is dependent upon our ability to accurately predict rapidly changing fashion trends, customer preferences, and other fashion-related factors.Our sales and operating results depend in part on our ability to effectively predict and quickly respond to changes in fashion trends and customer preferences. We continuously assess emerging styles and trends and focus on developing a merchandise assortment to meet customer preferences at competitive prices. Even with these efforts, we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully meet constantly changing fashion trends and customer preferences. If we are unable to successfully predict or respond to changing styles or preferences, we may be faced with lower sales, increased inventories, additional markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow-moving inventory, and lower gross margins, all of which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 3Table of ContentsOur failure to protect our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business.We offer our customers quality products at competitive prices and a high level of customer service, resulting in a well-recognized brand and customer loyalty. Among other things, failure to respond rapidly to changing trends could diminish brand and customer loyalty and impact our reputation with customers.Any significant damage to our brand or reputation could negatively impact sales, diminish customer trust and generate negative sentiment, any of which would harm our business and results of operation. Fluctuations in the price of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods and negatively impact our financial results.Fluctuations in the price and availability of fuel, labor and raw materials, combined with the inability to mitigate or to pass cost increases on to our customers or to change our merchandise mix as a result of such cost increases, could have an adverse impact on our profitability. Attempts to pass such costs along to our customers, however, might cause a decline in our sales volume. Additionally, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair our ability to meet our purchasing requirements in a timely manner. Both the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs.Third party suppliers on whom we rely to obtain materials and provide production facilities may experience financial difficulties due to current and future economic conditions.Our suppliers may experience financial difficulties due to a downturn in the industry or in other macroeconomic environments. Our suppliers' cash and working capital needs can be adversely impacted by the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor. Current and future economic conditions may prevent our suppliers from obtaining financing on favorable terms, which could impact their ability to supply us with merchandise on a timely basis. We source many of our products from foreign countries, which exposes us to certain risks that include political and economic conditions.Political discourse has recently focused on ways to discourage corporations in the United States from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions. Proposals to address this concern include the possibility of imposing tariffs, border adjustments or other penalties on goods manufactured outside the United States to attempt to discourage these practices. It has also been suggested that the United States may materially modify or withdraw from some of its existing trade agreements. Any of these actions, if ultimately enacted, could negatively impact our ability to source products from foreign jurisdictions and could lead to an increase in the cost of goods and adversely affect our profitability.Moreover, our third-party suppliers in foreign jurisdictions are subject to political and economic uncertainty. We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with changing economic and political conditions in foreign countries where our suppliers are located, including increased import duties, tariffs, trade restrictions and quotas, work stoppages, economic uncertainties, adverse foreign government regulations, wars, fears of war, terrorist attacks and organizing activities, adverse fluctuations of foreign currencies and political unrest.  We cannot predict when, or the extent to which, the countries in which our products are manufactured will experience any of the foregoing events. Any event causing a disruption or delay of imports from foreign locations would likely increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us and would adversely affect our operating results. In addition, trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as United States or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us or may require us to modify our current business practices, any of which could adversely affect our profitability.Failure by third party suppliers to comply with our supplier compliance programs or applicable laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.All of our suppliers must comply with our supplier compliance programs and applicable laws, including consumer and product safety laws, but we do not control our vendors or their labor and business practices. The violation of labor or other laws by one of our vendors could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, although we diversify our sourcing and production, the failure of any supplier to produce and deliver our goods on time, to meet our quality standards and adhere to our product safety requirements or to meet the requirements of our supplier compliance program or applicable laws, could impact our ability to flow merchandise to our stores or directly to consumers in the right quantities at the right time, which could adversely affect our profitability and could result in damage to our reputation and translate into sales losses.4Table of ContentsA decrease in cash flows from our operations and constraints to accessing other financing sources could limit our ability to fund our operations, capital projects, interest and debt repayments, stock repurchases and dividends.Our business depends upon our operations to generate strong cash flow and to some extent upon the availability of financing sources to supply capital to fund our general operating activities, capital projects, interest and debt repayments, stock repurchases and dividends. Our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or the lack of available financing in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed could adversely affect our financial performance including our earnings per share.Reductions in the income and cash flow from our long-term marketing and servicing alliance related to our private label credit cards could impact operating results and cash flows.Wells Fargo owns and manages our private label credit cards under the Wells Fargo Alliance. The Wells Fargo Alliance provides for certain payments to be made by Wells Fargo to the Company, including the Company's share of revenues under this alliance. The income and cash flow that the Company receives from the Wells Fargo Alliance is dependent upon a number of factors including the level of sales on Wells Fargo accounts, the level of balances carried on the Wells Fargo accounts by Wells Fargo customers, payment rates on Wells Fargo accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on Wells Fargo accounts, the level of credit losses for the Wells Fargo accounts, Wells Fargo's ability to extend credit to our customers as well as the cost of customer rewards programs, all of which can vary based on changes in federal and state banking and consumer protection laws and from a variety of economic, legal, social and other factors that we cannot control. If the income or cash flow that the Company receives from the Wells Fargo Alliance decreases, our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.Credit card operations are subject to numerous federal and state laws that impose disclosure and other requirements upon the origination, servicing, and enforcement of credit accounts, and limitations on the amount of finance charges and fees that may be charged by a credit card provider. Wells Fargo may be subject to regulations that may adversely impact its operation of our private label credit card. To the extent that such limitations or regulations materially limit the availability of credit or increase the cost of credit to our cardholders or negatively impact provisions which affect our revenue streams associated with our private label credit card, our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in credit card use, payment patterns, or default rates could be affected by a variety of economic, legal, social, or other factors over which we have no control and cannot predict with certainty. Such changes could also negatively impact our ability to facilitate consumer credit or increase the cost of credit to our cardholders.Our business is seasonal, and fluctuations in our revenues during the last quarter of our fiscal year can have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations.Our business, like many other retailers, is subject to seasonal influences, with a significant portion of sales and income typically realized during the last quarter of our fiscal year due to the holiday season.

Although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient and that we have appropriate contingency plans, unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fire, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements, or other shipping problems may result in the loss of inventory and/or delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and customers.Current store locations may become less desirable, and desirable new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations.In order to generate customer traffic and for convenience of our customers, we attempt to locate our stores in desirable locations within shopping malls and open air centers. Our stores benefit from the abilities that our Company, other anchor tenants and other area attractions have to generate consumer traffic. Adverse changes in the development of new shopping malls in the United States, the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping malls, competition with other retailers for prominent locations, the success of individual shopping malls and the success or failure of other anchor tenants, or the continued popularity of shopping malls may continue to impact our ability to maintain or grow our sales in our existing stores, as well as our ability to open new stores, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.5Table of ContentsOwnership and leasing of significant amounts of real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses.We own the land and building, or lease the land and/or the building, for all of our stores. Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks associated with owning and leasing real estate. In particular, the value of our real estate assets could decrease, and their operating costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends and supply or demand for the use of the store, which may result from competition from similar stores in the area.  Additionally, we are subject to potential liability for environmental conditions on the property that we own or lease.  If an existing owned store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be required to record an impairment charge and/or exit costs associated with the disposal of the store. We generally cannot cancel our leases. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be committed to perform certain obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each of the leases expires, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations. We may not be able to close an unprofitable owned store due to an existing operating covenant which may cause us to operate the location at a loss and prevent us from finding a more desirable location. We have approximately 75 stores along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts that are covered by third-party insurance but are self-insured for property and merchandise losses related to ""named storms."" As a result, the repair and replacement costs will be borne by us for damage to any of these stores from ""named storms,"" which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.A privacy breach could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial condition.We receive certain personal information about our employees and our customers, including information permitting cashless payments, both in our stores and through our online operations at www.dillards.com. In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks.We have a longstanding Information Security Program committed to regular risk assessment practices surrounding the protection of confidential data. This program includes network segmentation and access controls around the computer resources that house confidential data.  We continue to evaluate the security environment surrounding the handling and control of our critical data, especially the private data we receive from our customers, and we institute additional measures to help protect us from a privacy breach. Despite our security measures, it is possible that unauthorized persons (through cyberattacks, which are evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, physical breach or other means) might defeat our security measures, those of Wells Fargo or of our other third party service providers or vendors, and obtain personal information of customers, employees or others.  We have purchased Network Security and Cyber Liability insurance to provide some financial protection should a privacy breach occur; however, such a compromise, whether in our information security system or our third party service providers or vendors, resulting in personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers, employees and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations.Litigation with customers, employees and others could harm our reputation and impact operating results.In the ordinary course of business, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions. We are impacted by trends in litigation, including, but not limited to, class-action allegations brought under various consumer protection, employment, and privacy and information security laws. Additionally, we may be subject to employment-related claims alleging discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and wage issues, including those relating to overtime compensation. We are susceptible to claims filed by customers alleging responsibility for injury suffered during a visit to a store or from product defects, and we are also subject to lawsuits filed by patent holders alleging patent infringement. These types of claims, as well as other types of lawsuits to which we are subject from time to time, can distract management's attention from core business operations and impact operating results, particularly if a lawsuit results in an unfavorable outcome.6Table of ContentsOur profitability may be adversely impacted by weather conditions.Our merchandise assortments reflect assumptions regarding expected weather patterns and our profitability depends on our ability to timely deliver seasonally appropriate inventory. Unexpected or unseasonable weather conditions could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with consumer needs. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of the Company's inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions. Additionally, extreme weather or natural disasters, particularly in the areas in which our stores are located, could also severely hinder our ability to timely deliver seasonally appropriate merchandise. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for the Company's customers to travel to its stores and thereby reduce the Company's sales and profitability. A reduction in the demand for or supply of our seasonal merchandise or reduced sales due to reduced customer traffic in our stores could have an adverse effect on our inventory levels, gross margins and results of operations.Natural disasters, war, acts of violence, acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts, and public health issues may adversely impact our business.The occurrence of, or threat of, a natural disaster, war, acts of violence, acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts, and public health issues could disrupt our operations, disrupt international trade and supply chain efficiencies, suppliers or customers, or result in political or economic instability. If commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted, as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers, fulfillment centers, stores, or directly to customers. As a result of the occurrence of, or threat of, a natural disaster, acts of violence or acts of terrorism in the United States, we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our stores, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Increases in the cost of employee benefits could impact the Company's financial results and cash flows.The Company's expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant. Unfavorable changes in the cost of such benefits could impact the Company's financial results and cash flows. Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform could result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, employees may be ineligible for certain healthcare subsidies if such employee is eligible and offered qualifying and affordable healthcare coverage under an employer's plan. Due to the breadth and complexity of the healthcare reform legislation, the lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance, and the uncertainty surrounding further reform proposals, the Company is not able to fully determine the impact that healthcare reform will have in the future on company sponsored medical plans. The Company depends on its ability to attract and retain quality employees, and failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy and our operating results.The Company's business is dependent upon attracting and retaining quality employees. The Company has a large number of employees, many of whom are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. The Company's ability to meet its labor needs while controlling the costs associated with hiring and training new employees is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, changing demographics, prevailing wage rates, and current or future minimum wage and health care reform legislation. In addition, as a complex enterprise operating in a highly competitive and challenging business environment, the Company is highly dependent upon management personnel to develop and effectively execute successful business strategies and tactics. Any circumstances that adversely impact the Company's ability to attract, train, develop and retain quality employees throughout the organization could adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations.Variations in the amount of vendor allowances received could adversely impact our operating results.We receive vendor allowances for advertising, payroll and margin maintenance that are a strategic part of our operations. A reduction in the amount of cooperative advertising allowances would likely cause us to consider other methods of advertising as well as the volume and frequency of our product advertising, which could increase/decrease our expenditures and/or revenue. Decreased payroll reimbursements would either cause payroll costs to rise, negatively impacting operating income, or cause us to reduce the number of employees, which may cause a decline in sales. A decline in the amount of margin maintenance allowances would either increase cost of sales, which would negatively impact gross margin and operating income, or cause us to reduce merchandise purchases, which may cause a decline in sales.7Table of ContentsOur operations are dependent on information technology systems, and disruptions in those systems could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Our operations are dependent upon the integrity, security and consistent operation of various systems and data centers, including the point-of-sale systems in the stores, our Internet website, data centers that process transactions, communication systems and various software applications used throughout our Company to track inventory flow, process transactions and generate performance and financial reports. The Company's computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyberattack or other security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by the Company's employees. If the Company's computer systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the Company may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and the Company may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in its operations in the interim. Any material interruption in the Company's computer systems could adversely affect its business or results of operations. Additionally, to keep pace with changing technology, we must continuously provide for the design and implementation of new information technology systems and enhancements of our existing systems. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems or maintaining and upgrading existing systems. Such difficulties could lead to significant expenses or to losses due to disruption in business operations.The percentage-of-completion method of accounting that we use to recognize contract revenues for our construction segment may result in material adjustments, which could result in a credit or a charge against our earnings.Our construction segment recognizes contract revenues using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, estimated contract revenues are recognized by applying the percentage of completion of the project for the period to the total estimated revenues for the contract. Estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined. Total contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum on a quarterly basis as the work progresses and as change orders are approved. Adjustments based upon the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues in the period when these estimates are revised. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we are required to recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material.8Table of Contents"
1,DDS,DILLARDS INC  -CL A,2017-03-24,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS.The risks described in this Item 1A, Risk Factors
, of this Annual Report could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company cautions that forward-looking statements, as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on estimates, projections, beliefs and assumptions of management at the time of such statements and are not guarantees of future performance. The Company disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements based on the occurrence of future events, the receipt of new information, or otherwise. Forward-looking statements of the Company involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by the Company and its management as a result of a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.The retail merchandise business is highly competitive, and that competition could lower our revenues, margins and market share.We conduct our retail merchandise business under highly competitive conditions. Competition is characterized by many factors including location, reputation, fashion, merchandise assortment, advertising, operating efficiency, price, quality, customer service and credit availability. We have numerous competitors nationally, locally and on the Internet, including conventional department stores, specialty retailers, off-price and discount stores, boutiques, mass merchants, and Internet and mail-order retailers. Although we are a large regional department store, some of our competitors are larger than us with greater financial resources and, as a result, may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting and selling their products. Additionally, we compete in certain markets with a substantial number of retailers that specialize in one or more types of merchandise that we sell. In recent years, competition has intensified as a result of reduced discretionary consumer spending, increased promotional activity, deep price discounting, and few barriers to entry. Also, online retail shopping continues to rapidly evolve, and we continue to expect competition in the e-commerce market to intensify in the future as the Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping. We anticipate that intense competition will continue from both existing competitors and new entrants. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for products, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share.Changes in economic, financial and political conditions, and the resulting impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The retail merchandise business is highly sensitive to changes in overall economic and political conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending. Various economic conditions affect the level of disposable income consumers have available to spend on the merchandise we offer, including unemployment rates, interest rates, taxation, energy costs, the availability of consumer credit, the price of gasoline, consumer confidence in future economic conditions and general business conditions. Due to the Company's concentration of stores in energy producing regions, recent declining conditions in these regions could adversely affect the Company's sales. Consumer purchases of discretionary items and other retail products generally decline during recessionary periods, and also may decline at other times when changes in consumer spending patterns affect us unfavorably. In addition, any significant decreases in shopping mall traffic could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Our business is dependent upon our ability to accurately predict rapidly changing fashion trends, customer preferences, and other fashion-related factors.Our sales and operating results depend in part on our ability to effectively predict and quickly respond to changes in fashion trends and customer preferences. We continuously assess emerging styles and trends and focus on developing a merchandise assortment to meet customer preferences at competitive prices. Even with these efforts, we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully meet constantly changing fashion trends and customer preferences. If we are unable to successfully predict or respond to changing styles or preferences, we may be faced with lower sales, increased inventories, additional markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow-moving inventory, and lower gross margins, all of which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 3Table of ContentsOur failure to protect our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business.We offer our customers quality products at competitive prices and a high level of customer service, resulting in a well-recognized brand and customer loyalty. Among other things, failure to respond rapidly to changing trends could diminish brand and customer loyalty and impact our reputation with customers.Any significant damage to our brand or reputation could negatively impact sales, diminish customer trust and generate negative sentiment, any of which would harm our business and results of operation. Fluctuations in the price of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods and negatively impact our financial results.Fluctuations in the price and availability of fuel, labor and raw materials, combined with the inability to mitigate or to pass cost increases on to our customers or to change our merchandise mix as a result of such cost increases, could have an adverse impact on our profitability. Attempts to pass such costs along to our customers, however, might cause a decline in our sales volume. Additionally, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair our ability to meet our purchasing requirements in a timely manner. Both the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs.Third party suppliers on whom we rely to obtain materials and provide production facilities may experience financial difficulties due to current and future economic conditions.Our suppliers may experience financial difficulties due to a downturn in the industry or in other macroeconomic environments. Our suppliers' cash and working capital needs can be adversely impacted by the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor. Current and future economic conditions may prevent our suppliers from obtaining financing on favorable terms, which could impact their ability to supply us with merchandise on a timely basis. We source many of our products from foreign countries, which exposes us to certain risks that include political and economic conditions.Political discourse has recently focused on ways to discourage corporations in the United States from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions. Proposals to address this concern include the possibility of imposing tariffs, border adjustments or other penalties on goods manufactured outside the United States to attempt to discourage these practices. It has also been suggested that the United States may materially modify or withdraw from some of its existing trade agreements. Any of these actions, if ultimately enacted, could negatively impact our ability to source products from foreign jurisdictions and could lead to an increase in the cost of goods and adversely affect our profitability.Moreover, our third-party suppliers in foreign jurisdictions are subject to political and economic uncertainty. We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with changing economic and political conditions in foreign countries where our suppliers are located, including increased import duties, tariffs, trade restrictions and quotas, work stoppages, economic uncertainties, adverse foreign government regulations, wars, fears of war, terrorist attacks and organizing activities, adverse fluctuations of foreign currencies and political unrest.  We cannot predict when, or the extent to which, the countries in which our products are manufactured will experience any of the foregoing events. Any event causing a disruption or delay of imports from foreign locations would likely increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us and would adversely affect our operating results. In addition, trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as United States or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us or may require us to modify our current business practices, any of which could adversely affect our profitability.Failure by third party suppliers to comply with our supplier compliance programs or applicable laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.All of our suppliers must comply with our supplier compliance programs and applicable laws, including consumer and product safety laws, but we do not control our vendors or their labor and business practices. The violation of labor or other laws by one of our vendors could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, although we diversify our sourcing and production, the failure of any supplier to produce and deliver our goods on time, to meet our quality standards and adhere to our product safety requirements or to meet the requirements of our supplier compliance program or applicable laws, could impact our ability to flow merchandise to our stores or directly to consumers in the right quantities at the right time, which could adversely affect our profitability and could result in damage to our reputation and translate into sales losses.4Table of ContentsA decrease in cash flows from our operations and constraints to accessing other financing sources could limit our ability to fund our operations, capital projects, interest and debt repayments, stock repurchases and dividends.Our business depends upon our operations to generate strong cash flow and to some extent upon the availability of financing sources to supply capital to fund our general operating activities, capital projects, interest and debt repayments, stock repurchases and dividends. Our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or the lack of available financing in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed could adversely affect our financial performance including our earnings per share.Reductions in the income and cash flow from our long-term marketing and servicing alliance related to our private label credit cards could impact operating results and cash flows.Wells Fargo owns and manages our private label credit cards under the Wells Fargo Alliance. The Wells Fargo Alliance provides for certain payments to be made by Wells Fargo to the Company, including the Company's share of revenues under this alliance. The income and cash flow that the Company receives from the Wells Fargo Alliance is dependent upon a number of factors including the level of sales on Wells Fargo accounts, the level of balances carried on the Wells Fargo accounts by Wells Fargo customers, payment rates on Wells Fargo accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on Wells Fargo accounts, the level of credit losses for the Wells Fargo accounts, Wells Fargo's ability to extend credit to our customers as well as the cost of customer rewards programs, all of which can vary based on changes in federal and state banking and consumer protection laws and from a variety of economic, legal, social and other factors that we cannot control. If the income or cash flow that the Company receives from the Wells Fargo Alliance decreases, our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.Credit card operations are subject to numerous federal and state laws that impose disclosure and other requirements upon the origination, servicing, and enforcement of credit accounts, and limitations on the amount of finance charges and fees that may be charged by a credit card provider. Wells Fargo may be subject to regulations that may adversely impact its operation of our private label credit card. To the extent that such limitations or regulations materially limit the availability of credit or increase the cost of credit to our cardholders or negatively impact provisions which affect our revenue streams associated with our private label credit card, our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in credit card use, payment patterns, or default rates could be affected by a variety of economic, legal, social, or other factors over which we have no control and cannot predict with certainty. Such changes could also negatively impact our ability to facilitate consumer credit or increase the cost of credit to our cardholders.Our business is seasonal, and fluctuations in our revenues during the last quarter of our fiscal year can have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations.Our business, like many other retailers, is subject to seasonal influences, with a significant portion of sales and income typically realized during the last quarter of our fiscal year due to the holiday season. Our fiscal fourth-quarter results may fluctuate significantly, based on many factors, including holiday spending patterns and weather conditions, and any such fluctuation could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year. Because of the seasonality of our business, our operating results vary considerably from quarter to quarter, and results from any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.A shutdown of, or disruption in, any of the Company's distribution or fulfillment centers would have an adverse effect on the Company's business and operations.Our business depends on the orderly operation of the process of receiving and distributing merchandise, which relies on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management of distribution centers.

Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform could result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Many of our employees who currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans may find it more advantageous to do so as a result of recent changes to healthcare laws in the United States. Such changes include potential penalties on persons for not obtaining healthcare coverage. Additionally, employees may be ineligible for certain healthcare subsidies if such employee is eligible and offered qualifying and affordable healthcare coverage under an employer's plan. If a large portion of eligible employees who currently choose not to participate in our plans choose to enroll as a result of the law change, it may significantly increase our healthcare coverage costs, or we may not be able to offer competitive health care benefits to attract and retain employees; either of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and have a negative impact on our financial results.The Company depends on its ability to attract and retain quality employees, and failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy and our operating results.The Company's business is dependent upon attracting and retaining quality employees.

To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we are required to recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material.8Table of Contents"

, of this Annual Report could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company cautions that forward-looking statements, as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on estimates, projections, beliefs and assumptions of management at the time of such statements and are not guarantees of future performance. The Company disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements based on the occurrence of future events, the receipt of new information, or otherwise. Forward-looking statements of the Company involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by the Company and its management as a result of a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.The retail merchandise business is highly competitive, and that competition could lower our revenues, margins and market share.We conduct our retail merchandise business under highly competitive conditions. Competition is characterized by many factors including location, reputation, fashion, merchandise assortment, advertising, operating efficiency, price, quality, customer service and credit availability. We have numerous competitors nationally, locally and on the Internet, including conventional department stores, specialty retailers, off-price and discount stores, boutiques, mass merchants, and Internet and mail-order retailers. Although we are a large regional department store, some of our competitors are larger than us with greater financial resources and, as a result, may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting and selling their products. Additionally, we compete in certain markets with a substantial number of retailers that specialize in one or more types of merchandise that we sell. In recent years, competition has intensified as a result of reduced discretionary consumer spending, increased promotional activity, deep price discounting, and few barriers to entry. Also, online retail shopping continues to rapidly evolve, and we continue to expect competition in the e-commerce market to intensify in the future as the Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping. We anticipate that intense competition will continue from both existing competitors and new entrants. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for products, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share.Changes in economic, financial and political conditions, and the resulting impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The retail merchandise business is highly sensitive to changes in overall economic and political conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending. Various economic conditions affect the level of disposable income consumers have available to spend on the merchandise we offer, including unemployment rates, interest rates, taxation, energy costs, the availability of consumer credit, the price of gasoline, consumer confidence in future economic conditions and general business conditions. Due to the Company's concentration of stores in energy producing regions, recent declining conditions in these regions could adversely affect the Company's sales. Consumer purchases of discretionary items and other retail products generally decline during recessionary periods, and also may decline at other times when changes in consumer spending patterns affect us unfavorably. In addition, any significant decreases in shopping mall traffic could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Our business is dependent upon our ability to accurately predict rapidly changing fashion trends, customer preferences, and other fashion-related factors.Our sales and operating results depend in part on our ability to effectively predict and quickly respond to changes in fashion trends and customer preferences. We continuously assess emerging styles and trends and focus on developing a merchandise assortment to meet customer preferences at competitive prices. Even with these efforts, we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully meet constantly changing fashion trends and customer preferences. If we are unable to successfully predict or respond to changing styles or preferences, we may be faced with lower sales, increased inventories, additional markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow-moving inventory, and lower gross margins, all of which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, failure to respond rapidly to changing trends could impact our reputation with customers and diminish brand and customer loyalty.Our failure to protect our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business.We offer our customers quality products at competitive prices and a high level of customer service, resulting in a well-recognized brand and customer loyalty. Any significant damage to our brand or reputation could negatively impact sales, diminish customer trust and generate negative sentiment, any of which would harm our business and results of operation.3Table of ContentsFluctuations in the price of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods and negatively impact our financial results.Fluctuations in the price and availability of fuel, labor and raw materials, combined with the inability to mitigate or to pass cost increases on to our customers or to change our merchandise mix as a result of such cost increases, could have an adverse impact on our profitability. Attempts to pass such costs along to our customers, however, might cause a decline in our sales volume. Additionally, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair our ability to meet our purchasing requirements in a timely manner. Both the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs.Third party suppliers on whom we rely to obtain materials and provide production facilities may experience financial difficulties due to current and future economic and political conditions.Our suppliers may experience financial difficulties due to a downturn in the industry or in other macroeconomic environments. Our suppliers' cash and working capital needs can be adversely impacted by the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor. Current and future economic conditions may prevent our suppliers from obtaining financing on favorable terms, which could impact their ability to supply us with merchandise on a timely basis. Similarly, political or financial instability, changes in U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affecting the importation and taxation of goods, including duties, tariffs and quotas, or changes in the enforcement of those laws and regulations, as well as currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade and the inability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms could adversely impact our results of operations.An increase in the cost or a disruption in the flow of our imported goods could decrease our sales and profits.We source many of our products from vendors in countries outside of the United States. Any disruption in the flow of imported merchandise, including strikes at ports at home or abroad, or an increase in the cost of those goods may harm our business and decrease our profitability.All of our suppliers must comply with our supplier compliance programs and applicable laws, including consumer and product safety laws, but we do not control our vendors or their labor and business practices. The violation of labor or other laws by one of our vendors could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, although we diversify our sourcing and production, the failure of any supplier to produce and deliver our goods on time, to meet our quality standards and adhere to our product safety requirements or to meet the requirements of our supplier compliance program or applicable laws, could impact our ability to flow merchandise to our stores or directly to consumers in the right quantities at the right time, which could adversely affect our profitability and could result in damage to our reputation and translate into sales losses.A decrease in cash flows from our operations and constraints to accessing other financing sources could limit our ability to fund our operations, capital projects, interest and debt repayments, stock repurchases and dividends.Our business depends upon our operations to generate strong cash flow and to some extent upon the availability of financing sources to supply capital to fund our general operating activities, capital projects, interest and debt repayments, stock repurchases and dividends. Our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or the lack of available financing in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed could adversely affect our financial performance including our earnings per share.Reductions in the income and cash flow from our long-term marketing and servicing alliance related to our private label credit cards could impact operating results and cash flows.Wells Fargo owns and manages our private label credit cards under the Wells Fargo Alliance. The Wells Fargo Alliance provides for certain payments to be made by Wells Fargo to the Company, including the Company's share of revenues under this alliance. The income and cash flow that the Company receives from the Wells Fargo Alliance is dependent upon a number of factors including the level of sales on Wells Fargo accounts, the level of balances carried on the Wells Fargo accounts by Wells Fargo customers, payment rates on Wells Fargo accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on Wells Fargo accounts, the level of credit losses for the Wells Fargo accounts, Wells Fargo's ability to extend credit to our customers as well as the cost of customer rewards programs, all of which can vary based on changes in federal and state banking and consumer protection laws and from a variety of economic, legal, social and other factors that we cannot control. If the income or cash flow that the Company receives from the Wells Fargo Alliance decreases, our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.Credit card operations are subject to numerous federal and state laws that impose disclosure and other requirements upon the origination, servicing, and enforcement of credit accounts, and limitations on the amount of finance charges and fees that may be charged by a credit card provider. Wells Fargo may be subject to regulations that may adversely impact its operation of our private label credit card. To the extent that such limitations or regulations materially limit the availability of credit or 4Table of Contentsincrease the cost of credit to our cardholders or negatively impact provisions which affect our revenue streams associated with our private label credit card, our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in credit card use, payment patterns, or default rates could be affected by a variety of economic, legal, social, or other factors over which we have no control and cannot predict with certainty. Such changes could also negatively impact our ability to facilitate consumer credit or increase the cost of credit to our cardholders.Our business is seasonal, and fluctuations in our revenues during the last quarter of our fiscal year can have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations.Our business, like many other retailers, is subject to seasonal influences, with a significant portion of sales and income typically realized during the last quarter of our fiscal year due to the holiday season. Our fiscal fourth-quarter results may fluctuate significantly, based on many factors, including holiday spending patterns and weather conditions, and any such fluctuation could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year. Because of the seasonality of our business, our operating results vary considerably from quarter to quarter, and results from any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.A shutdown of, or disruption in, any of the Company's distribution or fulfillment centers would have an adverse effect on the Company's business and operations.Our business depends on the orderly operation of the process of receiving and distributing merchandise, which relies on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management of distribution centers. Although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient and that we have appropriate contingency plans, unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fire, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements, or other shipping problems may result in the loss of inventory and/or delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and customers.Current store locations may become less desirable, and desirable new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations.In order to generate customer traffic and for convenience of our customers, we locate our stores in desirable locations within shopping malls and open air centers. Our stores benefit from the abilities that our Company, other anchor tenants and other area attractions have to generate consumer traffic. They also benefit from the continuing popularity of shopping malls as shopping destinations. Adverse changes in the development of new shopping malls in the United States, the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping malls, competition with other retailers for prominent locations, the success of individual shopping malls and the success or failure of other anchor tenants, or the continued popularity of shopping malls may impact our ability to maintain or grow our sales in our existing stores, as well as our ability to open new stores, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Ownership and leasing of significant amounts of real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses.We own the land and building, or lease the land and/or the building, for all of our stores. Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks associated with owning and leasing real estate. In particular, the value of our real estate assets could decrease, and their operating costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends and supply or demand for the use of the store, which may result from competition from similar stores in the area.  Additionally, we are subject to potential liability for environmental conditions on the property that we own or lease.  If an existing owned store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be required to record an impairment charge and/or exit costs associated with the disposal of the store. We generally cannot cancel our leases. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be committed to perform certain obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each of the leases expires, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations. We may not be able to close an unprofitable owned store due to an existing operating covenant which may cause us to operate the location at a loss and prevent us from finding a more desirable location. We have approximately 75 stores along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts that are covered by third party insurance but are self-insured for property and merchandise losses related to ""named storms""; therefore, repair and replacement costs will be borne by us for damage to any of these stores from ""named storms"".A privacy breach could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial condition.We receive certain personal information about our employees and our customers, including information permitting cashless payments, both in our stores and through our online operations at www.dillards.com. In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks.5Table of ContentsWe have a longstanding Information Security Program committed to regular risk assessment practices surrounding the protection of confidential data. This program includes network segmentation and access controls around the computer resources that house confidential data.  We continue to evaluate the security environment surrounding the handling and control of our critical data, especially the private data we receive from our customers, and we institute additional measures to help protect us from a privacy breach. Despite our security measures, it is possible that unauthorized persons (through cyberattacks, which are evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, physical breach or other means) might defeat our security measures, those of Wells Fargo or of our other third party service providers or vendors, and obtain personal information of customers, employees or others.  We have purchased Network Security and Cyber Liability insurance to provide some financial protection should a privacy breach occur; however, such a compromise, whether in our information security system or our third party service providers or vendors, resulting in personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers, employees and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations.Litigation with customers, employees and others could harm our reputation and impact operating results.In the ordinary course of business, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions. We are impacted by trends in litigation, including, but not limited to, class-action allegations brought under various consumer protection, employment, and privacy and information security laws. Additionally, we may be subject to employment-related claims alleging discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and wage issues, including those relating to overtime compensation. We are susceptible to claims filed by customers alleging responsibility for injury suffered during a visit to a store or from product defects, and we are also subject to lawsuits filed by patent holders alleging patent infringement. These types of claims, as well as other types of lawsuits to which we are subject from time to time, can distract management's attention from core business operations and impact operating results, particularly if a lawsuit results in an unfavorable outcome.Our profitability may be adversely impacted by weather conditions.Our merchandise assortments reflect assumptions regarding expected weather patterns and our profitability depends on our ability to timely deliver seasonally appropriate inventory. Unexpected or unseasonable weather conditions could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with consumer needs. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of the Company's inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions. Additionally, extreme weather or natural disasters, particularly in the areas in which our stores are located, could also severely hinder our ability to timely deliver seasonally appropriate merchandise. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for the Company's customers to travel to its stores and thereby reduce the Company's sales and profitability. A reduction in the demand for or supply of our seasonal merchandise or reduced sales due to reduced customer traffic in our stores could have an adverse effect on our inventory levels, gross margins and results of operations.Natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts, and public health issues may adversely impact our business.The occurrence of, or threat of, a natural disaster, war, acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts, and public health issues could disrupt our operations, disrupt international trade and supply chain efficiencies, suppliers or customers, or result in political or economic instability. If commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted, as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers, fulfillment centers, stores, or directly to customers. As a result of the occurrence of, or threat of, a natural disaster or acts of terrorism in the United States, we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our stores, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Increases in the cost of employee benefits could impact the Company's financial results and cash flows.The Company's expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant. Unfavorable changes in the cost of such benefits could impact the Company's financial results and cash flows. Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform could result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Many of our employees who currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans may find it more advantageous to do so as a result of recent changes to healthcare laws in the United States. Such changes include potential penalties on persons for not obtaining healthcare coverage. Additionally, employees may be ineligible for certain healthcare subsidies if such employee is eligible and offered qualifying and affordable healthcare coverage under an employer's plan. If a large portion of eligible employees who currently choose not to participate in our plans choose to enroll as a result of the law 6Table of Contentschange, it may significantly increase our healthcare coverage costs, or we may not be able to offer competitive health care benefits to attract and retain employees; either of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and have a negative impact on our financial results.The Company depends on its ability to attract and retain quality employees, and failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy and our operating results.The Company's business is dependent upon attracting and retaining quality employees. The Company has a large number of employees, many of whom are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. The Company's ability to meet its labor needs while controlling the costs associated with hiring and training new employees is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, changing demographics, prevailing wage rates, and current or future minimum wage and health care reform legislation. In addition, as a complex enterprise operating in a highly competitive and challenging business environment, the Company is highly dependent upon management personnel to develop and effectively execute successful business strategies and tactics. Any circumstances that adversely impact the Company's ability to attract, train, develop and retain quality employees throughout the organization could adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations.Variations in the amount of vendor allowances received could adversely impact our operating results.We receive vendor allowances for advertising, payroll and margin maintenance that are a strategic part of our operations. A reduction in the amount of cooperative advertising allowances would likely cause us to consider other methods of advertising as well as the volume and frequency of our product advertising, which could increase/decrease our expenditures and/or revenue. Decreased payroll reimbursements would either cause payroll costs to rise, negatively impacting operating income, or cause us to reduce the number of employees, which may cause a decline in sales. A decline in the amount of margin maintenance allowances would either increase cost of sales, which would negatively impact gross margin and operating income, or cause us to reduce merchandise purchases, which may cause a decline in sales.Our operations are dependent on information technology systems, and disruptions in those systems could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Our operations are dependent upon the integrity, security and consistent operation of various systems and data centers, including the point-of-sale systems in the stores, our Internet website, data centers that process transactions, communication systems and various software applications used throughout our Company to track inventory flow, process transactions and generate performance and financial reports. The Company's computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyberattack or other security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by the Company's employees. If the Company's computer systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the Company may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and the Company may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in its operations in the interim. Any material interruption in the Company's computer systems could adversely affect its business or results of operations. Additionally, to keep pace with changing technology, we must continuously provide for the design and implementation of new information technology systems and enhancements of our existing systems. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems or maintaining and upgrading existing systems. Such difficulties could lead to significant expenses or to losses due to disruption in business operations.The percentage-of-completion method of accounting that we use to recognize contract revenues for our construction segment may result in material adjustments, which could result in a charge against our earnings.Our construction segment recognizes contract revenues using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, estimated contract revenues are recognized by applying the percentage of completion of the project for the period to the total estimated revenues for the contract. Estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined. Total contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum on a quarterly basis as the work progresses and as change orders are approved. Adjustments based upon the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues in the period when these estimates are revised. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we are required to recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material.7Table of Contents"

, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2015, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company cautions that forward-looking statements, as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on estimates, projections, beliefs and assumptions of management at the time of such statements and are not guarantees of future performance. The Company disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements based on the occurrence of future events, the receipt of new information, or otherwise. Forward-looking statements of the Company involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by the Company and its management as a result of a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.The retail merchandise business is highly competitive, and that competition could lower our revenues, margins and market share.We conduct our retail merchandise business under highly competitive conditions. Competition is characterized by many factors including location, reputation, fashion, merchandise assortment, advertising, operating efficiency, price, quality, customer service and credit availability. We have numerous competitors nationally, locally and on the Internet, including conventional department stores, specialty retailers, off-price and discount stores, boutiques, mass merchants, and Internet and mail-order retailers.

Various economic conditions affect the level of disposable income consumers have available to spend on the merchandise we offer, including unemployment rates, interest rates, taxation, energy costs, the availability of consumer credit, the price of gasoline, consumer confidence in future economic conditions and general business conditions. Consumer purchases of discretionary items and other retail products generally decline during recessionary periods, and also may decline at other times when changes in consumer spending patterns affect us unfavorably. In addition, any significant decreases in shopping mall traffic could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Our business is dependent upon our ability to accurately predict rapidly changing fashion trends, customer preferences, and other fashion-related factors.Our sales and operating results depend in part on our ability to effectively predict and quickly respond to changes in fashion trends and customer preferences. We continuously assess emerging styles and trends and focus on developing a merchandise assortment to meet customer preferences at competitive prices. Even with these efforts, we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully meet constantly changing fashion trends and customer preferences. If we are unable to successfully predict or respond to changing styles or preferences, we may be faced with lower sales, increased inventories, additional markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow-moving inventory, and lower gross margins, all of which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, failure to respond rapidly to changing trends could impact our reputation with customers and diminish brand and customer loyalty.Our failure to protect our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business.We offer our customers quality products at competitive prices and a high level of customer service, resulting in a well-recognized brand and customer loyalty. Any significant damage to our brand or reputation could negatively impact sales, diminish customer trust and generate negative sentiment, any of which would harm our business and results of operation.3Table of ContentsIncreases in the price of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods and negatively impact our financial results.We have experienced and may continue to experience increases in our merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor costs. Fluctuations in the price and availability of fuel, labor and raw materials, combined with the inability to mitigate or to pass cost increases on to our customers or to change our merchandise mix as a result of such cost increases, could have an adverse impact on our profitability. Attempts to pass such costs along to our customers, however, might cause a decline in our sales volume. Additionally, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair our ability to meet our purchasing requirements in a timely manner. Both the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs.Third party suppliers on whom we rely to obtain materials and provide production facilities may experience financial difficulties due to current and future economic and political conditions.Our suppliers may experience financial difficulties due to a downturn in the industry or in other macroeconomic environments. Our suppliers' cash and working capital needs can be adversely impacted by the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor. Current and future economic conditions may prevent our suppliers from obtaining financing on favorable terms, which could impact their ability to supply us with merchandise on a timely basis. Similarly, political or financial instability, changes in U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affecting the importation and taxation of goods, including duties, tariffs and quotas, or changes in the enforcement of those laws and regulations, as well as currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade and the inability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms could adversely impact our results of operations.An increase in the cost or a disruption in the flow of our imported goods could decrease our sales and profits.We source many of our products from vendors in countries outside of the United States. Any disruption in the flow of imported merchandise, including strikes at ports at home or abroad, or an increase in the cost of those goods may harm our business and decrease our profitability.All of our suppliers must comply with our supplier compliance programs and applicable laws, including consumer and product safety laws, but we do not control our vendors or their labor and business practices.

The continuation of the economic slowdown in the United States could impact shopping mall operators' financial ability to develop new shopping malls and properly maintain existing shopping malls, which could adversely affect our sales.Ownership and leasing of significant amounts of real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses.We own the land and building, or lease the land and/or the building, for all of our stores. Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks associated with owning and leasing real estate.

If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be committed to perform certain obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each of the leases expires, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations. We may not be able to close an unprofitable owned store due to an existing operating covenant which may cause us to operate the location at a loss and prevent us from finding a more desirable location. We have approximately 75 stores along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts that are covered by third party insurance but are self-insured for property and merchandise losses related to ""named storms""; therefore, repair and replacement costs will be borne by us for damage to any of these stores from ""named storms"".5Table of ContentsA privacy breach could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial condition.We receive certain personal information about our employees and our customers, including information permitting cashless payments, both in our stores and through our online operations at www.dillards.com. In addition, our online operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks.We have a longstanding Information Security Program committed to regular risk assessment practices surrounding the protection of confidential data. This program includes network segmentation and access controls around the computer resources that house confidential data.  In response to recent high profile security breaches at other companies, we evaluated the security environment surrounding the handling and control of our critical data, especially the private data we receive from our customers, and instituted additional measures to help protect us from a privacy breach. Despite our security measures, it is possible that unauthorized persons (through cyberattacks, which are evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, physical breach or other means) might defeat our security measures in the future and obtain personal information of customers, employees or others that we hold.  We have purchased Network Security and Cyber Liability insurance to provide some financial protection should a privacy breach occur; however, such a compromise that results in personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers, employees and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations.Litigation with customers, employees and others could harm our reputation and impact operating results.In the ordinary course of business, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions. We are impacted by trends in litigation, including, but not limited to, class-action allegations brought under various consumer protection and employment laws. Additionally, we may be subject to employment-related claims alleging discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and wage issues, including those relating to overtime compensation. We are susceptible to claims filed by customers alleging responsibility for injury suffered during a visit to a store or from product defects, and we are also subject to lawsuits filed by patent holders alleging patent infringement. These types of claims, as well as other types of lawsuits to which we are subject from time to time, can distract management's attention from core business operations and impact operating results, particularly if a lawsuit results in an unfavorable outcome.Our profitability may be adversely impacted by weather conditions.Our merchandise assortments reflect assumptions regarding expected weather patterns and our profitability depends on our ability to timely deliver seasonally appropriate inventory. Unexpected or unseasonable weather conditions could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with consumer needs. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of the Company's inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions. Additionally, extreme weather or natural disasters, particularly in the areas in which our stores are located, could also severely hinder our ability to timely deliver seasonally appropriate merchandise. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for the Company's customers to travel to its stores and thereby reduce the Company's sales and profitability. A reduction in the demand for or supply of our seasonal merchandise or reduced sales due to reduced customer traffic in our stores could have an adverse effect on our inventory levels, gross margins and results of operations.Natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts, and public health issues may adversely impact our business.The occurrence of, or threat of, a natural disaster, war, acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts, and public health issues could disrupt our operations, disrupt international trade and supply chain efficiencies, suppliers or customers, or result in political or economic instability. If commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted, as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers, fulfillment centers, stores, or directly to customers. As a result of the occurrence of, or threat of, a natural disaster or acts of terrorism in the United States, we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our stores, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Increases in the cost of employee benefits could impact the Company's financial results and cash flows.The Company's expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant. Unfavorable changes in the cost of such benefits could impact the Company's financial results and cash flows. Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform could result in significant changes to the U.S. 6Table of Contentshealthcare system. Many of our employees who currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans may find it more advantageous to do so as a result of recent changes to healthcare laws in the United States. Such changes include potential penalties on persons for not obtaining healthcare coverage and employees being ineligible for certain healthcare subsidies if such employee is eligible and offered qualifying and affordable healthcare coverage under an employer's plan. If a large portion of eligible employees who currently choose not to participate in our plans choose to enroll as a result of the law change, it may significantly increase our healthcare coverage costs, or we may not be able to offer competitive health care benefits to attract and retain employees; either of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and have a negative impact on our financial results.The Company depends on its ability to attract and retain quality employees, and failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy and our operating results.The Company's business is dependent upon attracting and retaining quality employees. The Company has a large number of employees, many of whom are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. The Company's ability to meet its labor needs while controlling the costs associated with hiring and training new employees is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage and health reform legislation and changing demographics. In addition, as a complex enterprise operating in a highly competitive and challenging business environment, the Company is highly dependent upon management personnel to develop and effectively execute successful business strategies and tactics. Any circumstances that adversely impact the Company's ability to attract, train, develop and retain quality employees throughout the organization could adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations.Variations in the amount of vendor allowances received could adversely impact our operating results.We receive vendor allowances for advertising, payroll and margin maintenance that are a strategic part of our operations. A reduction in the amount of cooperative advertising allowances would likely cause us to consider other methods of advertising as well as the volume and frequency of our product advertising, which could increase/decrease our expenditures and/or revenue. Decreased payroll reimbursements would either cause payroll costs to rise, negatively impacting operating income, or cause us to reduce the number of employees, which may cause a decline in sales. A decline in the amount of margin maintenance allowances would either increase cost of sales, which would negatively impact gross margin and operating income, or cause us to reduce merchandise purchases, which may cause a decline in sales.Our operations are dependent on information technology systems, and disruptions in those systems could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Our operations are dependent upon the integrity, security and consistent operation of various systems and data centers, including the point-of-sale systems in the stores, our Internet website, data centers that process transactions, communication systems and various software applications used throughout our Company to track inventory flow, process transactions and generate performance and financial reports. The Company's computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyberattack or other security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by the Company's employees. If the Company's computer systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the Company may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and the Company may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in its operations in the interim. Any material interruption in the Company's computer systems could adversely affect its business or results of operations. Additionally, to keep pace with changing technology, we must continuously provide for the design and implementation of new information technology systems and enhancements of our existing systems. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems or maintaining and upgrading existing systems. Such difficulties could lead to significant expenses or to losses due to disruption in business operations.The percentage-of-completion method of accounting that we use to recognize contract revenues for our construction segment may result in material adjustments, which could result in a charge against our earnings.Our construction segment recognizes contract revenues using the percentage-of-completion method. Under this method, estimated contract revenues are recognized by applying the percentage of completion of the project for the period to the total estimated revenues for the contract. Estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined. Total contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum on a quarterly basis as the work progresses and as change orders are approved. Adjustments based upon the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues in the period when these estimates are revised. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we are required to recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material.7Table of Contents"

, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 1, 2014, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company cautions that forward-looking statements, as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on estimates, projections, beliefs and assumptions of management at the time of such statements and are not guarantees of future performance. The Company disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements based on the occurrence of future events, the receipt of new information, or otherwise. Forward-looking statements of the Company involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by the Company and its management as a result of a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.The retail merchandise business is highly competitive, and that competition could lower our revenues, margins and market share.We conduct our retail merchandise business under highly competitive conditions. Competition is characterized by many factors including location, reputation, fashion, merchandise assortment, advertising, operating efficiency, price, quality, customer service and credit availability. We have numerous competitors nationally, locally and on the Internet, including conventional department stores, specialty retailers, off-price and discount stores, boutiques, mass merchants, Internet and mail-order retailers. Although we are a large regional department store, some of our competitors are larger than us with greater financial resources and, as a result, may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting and selling their products. Additionally, we compete in certain markets with a substantial number of retailers that specialize in one or more types of merchandise that we sell. In recent years, competition has intensified as a result of reduced discretionary consumer spending, increased promotional activity, deep price discounting, and few barriers to entry. Also, online retail shopping is rapidly evolving, and we expect competition in the e-commerce market to intensify in the future as the Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping. We anticipate that intense competition will continue from both existing competitors and new entrants. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for products, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share.Changes in economic, financial and political conditions, and the resulting impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The retail merchandise business is highly sensitive to changes in overall economic and political conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending. Various economic conditions affect the level of disposable income consumers have available to spend on the merchandise we offer, including unemployment rates, interest rates, taxation, energy costs, the availability of consumer credit, the price of gasoline, consumer confidence in future economic conditions and general business conditions. Consumer purchases of discretionary items and other retail products generally decline during recessionary periods, and also may decline at other times when changes in consumer spending patterns affect us unfavorably. In addition, any significant decreases in shopping mall traffic, as a result of, among other things, higher gasoline prices, could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations.The ongoing global economic instability continues to cause a great deal of uncertainty domestically and abroad. Additional uncertainty has resulted from the ongoing debate in the United States regarding budgetary concerns, including the U.S. debt. This market uncertainty may continue to result in reduced consumer confidence and spending, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Our business is dependent upon our ability to accurately predict rapidly changing fashion trends, customer preferences, and other fashion-related factors.Our sales and operating results depend in part on our ability to effectively predict and quickly respond to changes in fashion trends and customer preferences. We continuously assess emerging styles and trends and focus on developing a merchandise assortment to meet customer preferences at competitive prices. Even with these efforts, we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully meet constantly changing fashion trends and customer preferences. If we are unable to successfully predict or respond to changing styles or preferences, we may be faced with lower sales, increased inventories, additional markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow-moving inventory, and lower gross margins, all of 3Table of Contentswhich would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, failure to respond rapidly to changing trends could impact our reputation with customers and diminish brand and customer loyalty.Our failure to protect our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business.We offer our customers quality products at competitive prices and a high level of customer service, resulting in a well-recognized brand and customer loyalty. Any significant damage to our brand or reputation could negatively impact sales, diminish customer trust and generate negative sentiment, any of which would harm our business and results of operation.Increases in the price of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods and negatively impact our financial results.We have experienced and may continue to experience increases in our merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor costs. Fluctuations in the price and availability of fuel, labor and raw materials, combined with the inability to mitigate or to pass cost increases on to our customers or to change our merchandise mix as a result of such cost increases, could have an adverse impact on our profitability. Attempts to pass such costs along to our customers, however, might cause a decline in our sales volume. Additionally, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair our ability to meet our purchasing requirements in a timely manner. Both the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs.Third party suppliers on whom we rely to obtain materials and provide production facilities may experience financial difficulties due to current and future economic and political conditions.Our suppliers may experience financial difficulties due to a downturn in the industry or in other macroeconomic environments. Our suppliers' cash and working capital needs can be adversely impacted by the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor. Current and future economic conditions may prevent our suppliers from obtaining financing on favorable terms, which could impact their ability to supply us with merchandise on a timely basis. Similarly, political or financial instability, changes in U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affecting the importation and taxation of goods, including duties, tariffs and quotas, or changes in the enforcement of those laws and regulations, as well as currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade and the inability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms could adversely impact our results of operations.An increase in the cost or a disruption in the flow of our imported goods could decrease our sales and profits.We source many of our products from vendors in countries outside of the United States. Any disruption in the flow of imported merchandise, including strikes at ports at home or abroad, or an increase in the cost of those goods may harm our business and decrease our profitability.All of our suppliers must comply with our supplier compliance programs and applicable laws, including consumer and product safety laws, but we do not control our vendors or their labor and business practices. The violation of labor or other laws by one of our vendors could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, although we diversify our sourcing and production by country, the failure of any supplier to produce and deliver our goods on time, to meet our quality standards and adhere to our product safety requirements or to meet the requirements of our supplier compliance program or applicable laws, could impact our ability to flow merchandise to our stores or directly to consumers in the right quantities at the right time, which could adversely affect our profitability and could result in damage to our reputation and translate into sales losses.A decrease in cash flows from our operations and constraints to accessing other financing sources could limit our ability to fund our operations, capital projects, interest and debt repayments, stock repurchases and dividends.Our business depends upon our operations to generate strong cash flow and to some extent upon the availability of financing sources to supply capital to fund our general operating activities, capital projects, interest and debt repayments, stock repurchases and dividends. Our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or the lack of availability of financing in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed could adversely affect our financial performance including our earnings per share.Reductions in the income and cash flow from our long-term marketing and servicing alliance related to our proprietary credit cards could impact operating results and cash flows.GE owns and manages our proprietary credit cards under the Alliance. The Alliance provides for certain payments to be made by GE to the Company, including a revenue sharing and marketing reimbursement. The income and cash flow that the Company receives from the Alliance is dependent upon a number of factors including the level of sales on GE accounts, the level of balances carried on the GE accounts by GE customers, payment rates on GE accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on GE accounts, the level of credit losses for the GE accounts, GE's ability to extend credit to our customers as well as 4Table of ContentsGE's funding costs, all of which can vary based on changes in federal and state banking and consumer protection laws and from a variety of economic, legal, social and other factors that we cannot control. If the income or cash flow that the Company receives from the Alliance decreases, our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.The Alliance expires in late fiscal 2014. If, when the Alliance expires, GE is unable or unwilling to renew and continue owning and managing our proprietary credit cards on similar terms and conditions as exist today or we are unable to quickly and adequately contract with a comparable replacement vendor, then our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected due to a decrease in credit card sales to our cardholding customers and a loss of revenues attributable to payments from GE. In addition, if our agreement with GE is terminated prior to its expiration under circumstances in which we are unable to quickly and adequately contract with a comparable replacement vendor, holders of our proprietary credit card will be unable to use their cards. This would likely result in a decrease in sales to such customers, a loss of the revenues attributable to the payments from GE and customer dissatisfaction, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Credit card operations are subject to numerous federal and state laws that impose disclosure and other requirements upon the origination, servicing, and enforcement of credit accounts, and limitations on the amount of finance charges and fees that may be charged by a credit card provider. GE may be subject to regulations that may adversely impact its operation of our proprietary credit card. To the extent that such limitations or regulations materially limit the availability of credit or increase the cost of credit to our cardholders or negatively impact provisions which affect our revenue streams associated with our proprietary credit card, our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in credit card use, payment patterns, or default rates could be affected by a variety of economic, legal, social, or other factors over which we have no control and cannot predict with certainty. Such changes could also negatively impact our ability to facilitate consumer credit or increase the cost of credit to our cardholders.Our business is seasonal, and fluctuations in our revenues during the last quarter of our fiscal year can have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations.Our business, like many other retailers, is subject to seasonal influences, with a significant portion of sales and income typically realized during the last quarter of our fiscal year due to the holiday season. Our fiscal fourth-quarter results may fluctuate significantly, based on many factors, including holiday spending patterns and weather conditions, and any such fluctuation could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year. Because of the seasonality of our business, our operating results vary considerably from quarter to quarter, and results from any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.A shutdown of, or disruption in, any of the Company's distribution or fulfillment centers would have an adverse effect on the Company's business and operations.Our business depends on the orderly operation of the process of receiving and distributing merchandise, which relies on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management of distribution centers. Although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient and that we have appropriate contingency plans, unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fire, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements, or other shipping problems may result in the loss of inventory and/or delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and customers.Current store locations may become less desirable, and desirable new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations.In order to generate customer traffic and for convenience of our customers, we locate our stores in desirable locations within shopping malls. Our stores benefit from the abilities that our Company, other anchor tenants and other area attractions have to generate consumer traffic. They also benefit from the continuing popularity of shopping malls as shopping destinations. Adverse changes in the development of new shopping malls in the United States, the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping malls, competition with other retailers for prominent locations, the success of individual shopping malls and the success of other anchor tenants, or the continued popularity of shopping malls may impact our ability to maintain or grow our sales in our existing stores, as well as our ability to open new stores, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Many shopping mall operators have been severely impacted by the recent global economic downturn. The continuation of the economic slowdown in the United States could impact shopping mall operators' financial ability to develop new shopping malls and properly maintain existing shopping malls, which could adversely affect our sales.5Table of ContentsOwnership and leasing of significant amounts of real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses.We own the land and building, or lease the land and/or the building, for all of our stores. Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks associated with owning and leasing real estate. In particular, the value of the assets could decrease, and their operating costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends and supply or demand for the use of the store, which may result from competition from similar stores in the area, as well as liability for environmental conditions. If an existing owned store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be required to record an impairment charge and/or exit costs associated with the disposal of the store. We generally cannot cancel our leases. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be committed to perform certain obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each of the leases expires, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations. We may not be able to close an unprofitable owned store due to an existing operating covenant which may cause us to operate the location at a loss and prevent us from finding a more desirable location. We have approximately 75 stores along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts that are covered by third party insurance but are self-insured for property and merchandise losses related to ""named storms""; therefore, repair and replacement costs will be borne by us for damage to any of these stores from ""named storms"".Litigation with customers, employees and others could harm our reputation and impact operating results.In the ordinary course of business, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions. We are impacted by trends in litigation, including, but not limited to, class-action allegations brought under various consumer protection and employment laws. Additionally, we may be subject to employment-related claims alleging discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and wage issues, including those relating to overtime compensation. We are susceptible to claims filed by customers alleging responsibility for injury suffered during a visit to a store or from product defects, and we are also subject to lawsuits filed by patent holders alleging patent infringement. These types of claims, as well as other types of lawsuits to which we are subject from time to time, can distract management's attention from core business operations and impact operating results, particularly if a lawsuit results in an unfavorable outcome.Our profitability may be adversely impacted by weather conditions.Our merchandise assortments reflect assumptions regarding expected weather patterns and our profitability depends on our ability to timely deliver seasonally appropriate inventory. Unexpected or unseasonable weather conditions could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with consumer needs. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of the Company's inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions. Additionally, extreme weather or natural disasters, particularly in the areas in which our stores are located, could also severely hinder our ability to timely deliver seasonally appropriate merchandise. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for the Company's customers to travel to its stores and thereby reduce the Company's sales and profitability. A reduction in the demand for or supply of our seasonal merchandise or reduced sales due to reduced customer traffic in our stores could have an adverse effect on our inventory levels, gross margins and results of operations.Natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts, and public health issues may adversely impact our business.The occurrence of, or threat of, a natural disaster, war, acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts, and public health issues could disrupt our operations, disrupt international trade and supply chain efficiencies, suppliers or customers, or result in political or economic instability. If commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted, as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers, fulfillment centers, stores, or directly to customers. As a result of the occurrence of, or threat of, a natural disaster or acts of terrorism in the United States, we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our stores, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Increases in the cost of employee benefits could impact the Company's financial results and cash flows.The Company's expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant. Unfavorable changes in the cost of such benefits could impact the Company's financial results and cash flows. Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform could result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Many of our employees who currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans may find it more advantageous to do so as a result of recent changes to healthcare laws in the United States. Such changes include potential penalties on persons for not obtaining healthcare coverage and being ineligible for certain healthcare subsidies if an employee is eligible and offered qualifying and affordable healthcare coverage under an employer's plan. If a large portion of eligible employees who currently choose not to participate in our plans choose to enroll as a result of the law change, it may 6Table of Contentssignificantly increase our healthcare coverage costs or we may not be able to offer competitive health care benefits to attract and retain employees, either of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and have a negative impact on our financial results.The Company depends on its ability to attract and retain quality employees, and failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy and our operating results.The Company's business is dependent upon attracting and retaining quality employees. The Company has a large number of employees, many of whom are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. The Company's ability to meet its labor needs while controlling the costs associated with hiring and training new employees is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage and health reform legislation and changing demographics. In addition, as a complex enterprise operating in a highly competitive and challenging business environment, the Company is highly dependent upon management personnel to develop and effectively execute successful business strategies and tactics. Any circumstances that adversely impact the Company's ability to attract, train, develop and retain quality employees throughout the organization could adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations.Variations in the amount of vendor allowances received could adversely impact our operating results.We receive vendor allowances for advertising, payroll and margin maintenance that are a strategic part of our operations. A reduction in the amount of cooperative advertising allowances would likely cause us to consider other methods of advertising as well as the volume and frequency of our product advertising, which could increase/decrease our expenditures and/or revenue. Decreased payroll reimbursements would either cause payroll costs to rise, negatively impacting operating income, or cause us to reduce the number of employees, which may cause a decline in sales. A decline in the amount of margin maintenance allowances would either increase cost of sales, which would negatively impact gross margin and operating income, or cause us to reduce merchandise purchases, which may cause a decline in sales.Our operations are dependent on information technology systems, and disruptions in those systems could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Our operations are dependent upon the integrity, security and consistent operation of various systems and data centers, including the point-of-sale systems in the stores, our Internet website, data centers that process transactions, communication systems and various software applications used throughout our Company to track inventory flow, process transactions and generate performance and financial reports. The Company's computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyberattack or other security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, and usage errors by the Company's employees. If the Company's computer systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the Company may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them, and the Company may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in its operations in the interim. Any material interruption in the Company's computer systems could adversely affect its business or results of operations. Additionally, to keep pace with changing technology, we must continuously provide for the design and implementation of new information technology systems and enhancements of our existing systems. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems or maintaining and upgrading existing systems. Such difficulties could lead to significant expenses or to losses due to disruption in business operations.A privacy breach could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial condition.We receive certain personal information about our employees and our customers, including information permitting cashless payments, both in our stores and through our online operations at www.dillards.com.

If we are unableto maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for products, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and theloss of market share.  Changes in economic, financial and political conditions, and the resulting impact on consumer confidence and consumer spending, could have an adverse effect on our businessand results of operations.          The retail merchandise business is highly sensitive to changes in overall economic and political conditions that impact consumerconfidence and spending. Various economic conditions affect the level of disposable income consumers have available to spend on the merchandise we offer, including unemployment rates, interest rates,taxation, energy costs, the availability of consumer credit, the price of gasoline, consumer confidence in future economic conditions and general business conditions. Consumer purchases ofdiscretionary items and other retail products generally decline during recessionary periods, and also may decline at other times when changes in consumer spending patterns affect us unfavorably. Inaddition, any significant decreases in shopping mall traffic, as a result of, among other things, higher gasoline prices, could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations.         In2008 and 2009, the combination of these factors caused consumer spending in the U.S. to deteriorate significantly. While consumer spending began to improve in 2010 and continued toimprove in 2011 and 2012, these factors may cause levels of spending to remain depressed relative to historical levels for the foreseeable future. In addition, these factors may cause consumers topurchase products from lower-priced competitors or to defer purchases of discretionary items altogether.         Theongoing global economic instability continues to cause a great deal of uncertainty domestically and abroad. Additional uncertainty has resulted from the ongoing debate in the UnitedStates regarding budgetary concerns, including the U.S. debt. This market uncertainty will likely continue to result in reduced consumer confidence and spending, which could have an adverse effect onour results of operations.  Our business is dependent upon our ability to accurately predict rapidly changing fashion trends, customer preferences, and other fashion-related factors.          Our sales and operating results depend in part on our ability to effectively predict and quickly respond to changes in fashion trendsand customer preferences. We continuously assess emerging styles and trends and focus on developing a merchandise assortment to meet customer preferences at competitive prices. Even with theseefforts, we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully meet constantly changing fashion trends and customer preferences. If we are unable to successfully predict or respond to changingstyles or preferences, we may be faced with lower sales, increased inventories, additional markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess or slow-moving inventory, and lower grossmargins, all of which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, failure to respond rapidly to changing trends could impact ourreputation with customers and diminish brand and customer loyalty.  Our failure to protect our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business.          We offer our customers quality products at competitive prices and a high level of customer service, resulting in awell-recognized brand and customer loyalty. Any significant damage to our brand or 4 Table of Contentsreputationcould negatively impact sales, diminish customer trust and generate negative sentiment, any of which would harm our business and results of operation.  Increases in the price of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods and negatively impact our financialresults.          We have experienced and may continue to experience increases in our merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor costs. Fluctuations inthe price and availability of fuel, labor and raw materials, combined with the inability to mitigate or to pass cost increases on to our customers or to change our merchandise mix as a result of suchcost increases, could have an adverse impact on our profitability. Attempts to pass such costs along to our customers, however, might cause a decline in our sales volume. Additionally, any decrease inthe availability of raw materials could impair our ability to meet our purchasing requirements in a timely manner. Both the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fueland labor may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs.  Third party suppliers on whom we rely to obtain materials and provide production facilities may experience financial difficulties due to current and future economic andpolitical conditions.          Our suppliers may experience financial difficulties due to a downturn in the industry or in other macroeconomic environments. Oursuppliers' cash and working capital needs can be adversely impacted by the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor. Current and future economic conditionsmay prevent our suppliers from obtaining financing on favorable terms, which could impact their ability to supply us with merchandise on a timely basis. Similarly, political or financial instability,changes in U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affecting the importation and taxation of goods, including duties, tariffs and quotas, or changes in the enforcement of those laws and regulations, aswell as currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade and the inability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms could adversely impactour results of operations.  An increase in the cost or a disruption in the flow of our imported goods could decrease our sales and profits.          We source many of our products from vendors in countries outside of the United States. Any disruption in the flow of importedmerchandise, including strikes at ports at home or abroad, or an increase in the cost of those goods may harm our business and decrease our profitability.         Allof our suppliers must comply with our supplier compliance programs and applicable laws, including consumer and product safety laws, but we do not control our vendors or their laborand business practices. The violation of labor or other laws by one of our vendors could have an adverse effect onour business. Additionally, although we diversify our sourcing and production by country, the failure of any supplier to produce and deliver our goods on time, to meet our quality standards and adhereto our product safety requirements or to meet the requirements of our supplier compliance program or applicable laws, could impact our ability to flow merchandise to our stores or directly toconsumers in the right quantities at the right time, which could adversely affect our profitability and could result in damage to our reputation and translate into sales losses.  A decrease in cash flows from our operations and constraints to accessing other financing sources could limit our ability to fund our operations, capital projects, interestand debt repayments, stock repurchases and dividends.          Our business depends upon our operations to generate strong cash flow and to some extent upon the availability of financing sources tosupply capital to fund our general operating activities, capital projects, interest and debt repayments, stock repurchases and dividends. Our inability to continue to 5 Table of Contentsgeneratesufficient cash flows to support these activities or the lack of availability of financing in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed could adversely affect our financialperformance including our earnings per share.  Reductions in the income and cash flow from our long-term marketing and servicing alliance related to our proprietary credit cards could impact operating resultsand cash flows.          GE owns and manages our proprietary credit cards under the Alliance. The Alliance provides for certain payments to be made by GE to theCompany, including a revenue sharing and marketing reimbursement. The income and cash flow that the Company receives from the Alliance is dependent upon a number of factors including the level ofsales on GE accounts, the level of balances carried on the GE accounts by GE customers, payment rates on GE accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on GE accounts, the level of credit losses forthe GE accounts, GE's ability to extend credit to our customers as well as GE's funding costs, all of which can vary based on changes in federal and state banking and consumer protection laws and froma variety of economic, legal, social and other factors that we cannot control. If the income or cash flow that the Company receives from the Alliance decreases, our operating results and cash flowscould be adversely affected.         TheAlliance expires in fiscal 2014. If, when the Alliance expires, GE is unable or unwilling to renew and continue owning and managing our proprietary credit cards on similar terms andconditions as exist today or we are unable to quickly and adequately contract with a comparable replacement vendor, then our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected due to adecrease in credit card sales to our cardholding customers and a loss of revenues attributable to payments from GE. In addition, if our agreement with GE is terminated prior to 2014 undercircumstances in which we are unable to quickly and adequately contract with a comparable replacement vendor, holders of our proprietary credit card will be unable to use their cards. This wouldlikely result in a decrease in sales to such customers, a loss of the revenues attributable to the payments from GE and customer dissatisfaction, any or all of which could have an adverse effect onour business and results of operations.         Creditcard operations are subject to numerous federal and state laws that impose disclosure and other requirements upon the origination, servicing, and enforcement of credit accounts,and limitations on the amount of finance charges and fees that may be charged by a credit card provider. GE may be subject to regulations that may adversely impact its operation of our proprietarycredit card. To the extent that such limitations or regulations materially limit the availability of credit or increase the cost of credit to our cardholders or negatively impact provisions whichaffect our revenue streams associated with our proprietary credit card, our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in credit card use, payment patterns, or defaultrates could be affected by a variety of economic, legal, social, or other factors over which we have no control and cannot predict with certainty. Such changes could also negatively impact our abilityto facilitate consumer credit or increase the cost of credit to our cardholders.  Our business is seasonal, and fluctuations in our revenues during the last quarter of our fiscal year can have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations.          Our business, like many other retailers, is subject to seasonal influences, with a significant portion of sales and income typicallyrealized during the last quarter of our fiscal year due to the holiday season. Our fiscal fourth-quarter results may fluctuate significantly, based on many factors, including holiday spending patternsand weather conditions, and any such fluctuation could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year. Because of the seasonality of our business, our operatingresults vary considerably from quarter to quarter, and results from any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. 6 Table of Contents  A shutdown of, or disruption in, any of the Company's distribution or fulfillment centers would have an adverse effect on the Company's business and operations.          Our business depends on the orderly operation of the process of receiving and distributing merchandise, which relies on adherence toshipping schedules and effective management of distribution centers. Although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient and that we have appropriate contingency plans,unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fire, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements, or other shipping problems may result in the loss ofinventory and/or delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and customers.  Current store locations may become less desirable, and desirable new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all, either of which could adversely affectour results of operations.          In order to generate customer traffic and for convenience of our customers, we locate our stores in desirable locations within shoppingmalls. Our stores benefit fromour, other anchor tenants, and other area attractions' ability to generate consumer traffic. They also benefit from the continuing popularity of shopping malls as shopping destinations. Adversechanges in the development of new shopping malls in the United States, the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping malls, competition with other retailers forprominent locations, the success of individual shopping malls and the success of other anchor tenants, or the continued popularity of shopping malls may impact our ability to maintain or grow oursales in our existing stores, as well as our ability to open new stores, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.         Manyshopping mall operators have been severely impacted by the recent global economic downturn. The continuation of the economic slowdown in the United States could impact shopping malloperators' financial ability to develop new shopping malls and properly maintain existing shopping malls, which could adversely affect our sales.  Ownership and leasing of significant amounts of real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses.          We own the land and building, or lease the land and/or the building, for all of our stores. Accordingly, we are subject to all of therisks associated with owning and leasing real estate. In particular, the value of the assets could decrease, and their operating costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate forreal estate, demographic trends and supply or demand for the use of the store, which may result from competition from similar stores in the area, as well as liability for environmental conditions. Ifan existing owned store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be required to record an impairment charge and/or exit costs associated with the disposal of the store. We generally cannotcancel our leases. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be committed to perform certain obligations under the applicable lease including, among otherthings, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each of the leases expires, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all,which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations. We may not be able to close an unprofitable owned store due to an existing operating covenant which may cause us to operate the location ata loss and prevent us from finding a more desirable location. We have approximately 75 stores along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts that are covered by third party insurance but areself-insured for property and merchandise losses related to ""named storms""; therefore, repair and replacement costs will be borne by us for damage to any of these stores from ""namedstorms"".  Litigation with customers, employees and others could harm our reputation and impact operating results.          In the ordinary course of business, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions. We are impacted by trends in litigation,including, but not limited to, class-action allegations brought under 7 Table of Contentsvariousconsumer protection and employment laws. Additionally, we may be subject to employment-related claims alleging, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and wage issues, includingthose relating to overtime compensation. We are also susceptible to claims filed by customers alleging responsibility for injury suffered during a visit to a store or from product defects. These typesof claims, as well as other types of lawsuits to which we are subject from time to time, can distract management's attention from core business operations and impact operating results, particularly ifa lawsuit results in an unfavorable outcome.  Our profitability may be adversely impacted by weather conditions.          Our merchandise assortments reflect assumptions regarding expected weather patterns and our profitability depends on our ability totimely deliver seasonally appropriate inventory. Unexpected or unseasonable weather conditions could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with consumer needs. For example, extended periodsof unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of the Company's inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions.Additionally, extreme weather or natural disasters, particularly in the areas in which our stores are located, could also severely hinder our ability to timely deliver seasonally appropriatemerchandise. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for the Company's customersto travel to its stores and thereby reduce the Company's sales and profitability. A reduction in the demand for or supply of our seasonal merchandise or reduced sales due to reduced customer trafficin our stores could have an adverse effect on our inventory levels, gross margins and results of operations.  Natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts, and public health issues may adversely impact our business.          The occurrence of, or threat of, a natural disaster, war, acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts, and public health issues coulddisrupt our operations, disrupt international trade and supply chain efficiencies, suppliers or customers, or result in political or economic instability. If commercial transportation is curtailed orsubstantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted, as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers, fulfillment centers, stores, or directly to customers. As aresult of the occurrence of, or threat of, a natural disaster or acts of terrorism in the United States, we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our stores, which could have amaterial adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Increases in the cost of employee benefits could impact the Company's financial results and cash flows.          The Company's expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant. Unfavorable changes in the cost of such benefits couldimpact the Company's financial results and cash flows. Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reformcould result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Many of our employees who currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans may find it more advantageous to do so whenrecent changes to healthcare laws in the United States become effective in 2014. Such changes include potential fees to persons for not obtaining healthcare coverage and being ineligible for certainhealthcare subsidies if an employee is eligible for healthcare coverage under an employer's plan. If a large portion of current eligible employees who currently choose not to participate in our planschoose to enroll when or after the law becomes effective, it may significantly increase our healthcare coverage costs or we may not be able to offer competitive health care benefits to attract andretain employees, either of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and have a negative impact on our financial results. 8 Table of Contents The Company depends on its ability to attract and retain quality employees, and failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy and ouroperating results.          The Company's business is dependent upon attracting and retaining quality employees. The Company has a large number of employees, manyof whom are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. The Company's ability to meet its labor needs while controlling the costs associated with hiringand training new employees is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. In addition, as a complex enterpriseoperating in a highly competitive and challenging business environment, the Company is highly dependent upon management personnel to develop and effectively execute successful business strategies andtactics. Any circumstances that adversely impact the Company's ability to attract, train, develop and retain quality employees throughout the organization could adversely affect the Company's businessand results of operations.  Variations in the amount of vendor allowances received could adversely impact our operating results.          We receive vendor allowances for advertising, payroll and margin maintenance that are a strategic part of our operations. A reductionin the amount of cooperative advertising allowances would likely cause us to consider other methods of advertising as well as the volume and frequency of our product advertising, which couldincrease/decrease our expenditures and/or revenue. Decreased payroll reimbursements would either cause payroll costs to rise, negatively impacting operating income, or cause us to reduce the number ofemployees, which may cause a decline in sales. A decline in the amount of margin maintenance allowances would either increase cost of sales, which would negatively impact gross margin and operatingincome, or cause us to reduce merchandise purchases, which may cause a decline in sales.  Our operations are dependent on information technology systems, and disruptions in those systems could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.          Our operations are dependent upon the integrity, security and consistent operation of various systems and data centers, including thepoint-of-sale systems in the stores, our Internet website, data centers that process transactions, communication systems and various software applications used throughout ourCompany to track inventory flow, process transactions and generate performance and financial reports. The Company's computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computerand telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attack or other security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism, andusage errors by the Company's employees. If the Company's computer systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the Company may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them,and the Company may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in its operations in the interim. Any material interruption in the Company's computer systems could adversely affect itsbusiness or results of operations. Additionally, to keep pace with changing technology, we must continuously provide for the design and implementation of new information technology systems andenhancements of our existing systems. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems or maintaining and upgrading existing systems. Such difficulties could lead to significant expenses orto losses due to disruption in business operations.  A privacy breach could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial condition.          The protection of customer, employee and Company data is critical to us. The regulatory environment surrounding information securityand privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. We receive certain personal information about our customers and employees. In addition,our online operations atwww.dillards.com depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting 9 Table of Contentscashlesspayments. A compromise that results in personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers, employees and others, as well asour operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a security breach could require that weexpend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations.  The percentage-of-completion method of accounting that we use to recognize contract revenues for our construction segment may result in materialadjustments, which could result in a charge against our earnings.          Our construction segment recognizes contract revenues using the percentage-of-completion method. Under thismethod, estimated contract revenues are recognized by applying the percentage of completion of the project for the period to the total estimated revenues for the contract. Estimated contract lossesare recognized in full when determined. Total contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum on a quarterly basis as the work progresses and as change orders are approved.Adjustments based upon the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues in the period when these estimates are revised. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, areduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we are required to recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material"

, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year endedJanuary 28, 2012, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.         TheCompany cautions that forward-looking statements, as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, contained in this Annual Report onForm 10-K are based on estimates, projections, beliefs and assumptions of management at the time of such statements and are not guarantees of future performance. The Companydisclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements based on the occurrence of future events, the receipt of new information, or otherwise. Forward-looking statements of theCompany involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors. Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed inforward-looking statements made by the Company and its management as a result of a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.  The retail merchandise business is highly competitive, and that competition could lower revenues, margins and market share.          We conduct our retail merchandise business under highly competitive conditions. Although we are a large regional department store, wehave numerous competitors at the national and local level that compete with our individual stores, including specialty, off-price, discount, Internet and mail-order retailers.Competition is characterized by many factors including location, reputation, fashion, merchandise assortment, advertising, price, quality, service and credit availability. We anticipate that intensecompetition will continue. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for products, reduced margins, the inability to takeadvantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share. 3 Table of Contents Changes in economic, market and other conditions could adversely affect our operating results.          The retail merchandise business is affected by changes in international, national, regional, and local economic conditions, consumerpreferences and spending patterns, demographic trends, consumer confidence, consumer credit availability, weather, traffic patterns, the type, number and location of competing stores, and the effectsof war or terrorist activities and any governmental responses thereto. Factors such as inflation, apparel costs, labor and benefit costs, legal claims, and the availability of management and hourlyemployees also affect store operations and administrative expenses. Our ability to finance new store development, improvements and additions to existing stores, and the acquisition of stores fromcompetitors is affected by economic conditions, including interest rates and other government policies impacting land and construction costs and the availability of borrowed funds.  Current store locations may become less desirable, and desirable new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all, either of which could adversely affectour results of operations.          The success of any store depends substantially upon its location. There can be no assurance that current locations will continue to bedesirable as demographic patterns change. Neighborhood or economic conditions where stores are located could decline in the future, thus resulting in potentially reduced sales in those locations. Ifwe cannot obtain desirable locations at reasonable prices, our cost structure will increase and our revenues will be adversely affected.  Ownership and leasing of significant amounts of real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses.          We own the land and building, or lease the land and/or the building, for all of our stores. Accordingly, we are subject to all of therisks associated with owning and leasing real estate. In particular, the value of the assets could decrease, and their operating costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate forreal estate, demographic trends and supply or demand for the use of the store, which may result from competition from similar stores in the area, as well asliability for environmental conditions. If an existing owned store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be required to record an impairment charge and/or exit costs associated with thedisposal of the store. We generally cannot cancel our leases. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be committed to perform certain obligations under theapplicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each of the leases expires, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either oncommercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations. We may not be able to close an unprofitable owned store due to an existing operating covenantwhich may cause us to operate the location at a loss and prevent us from finding a more desirable location. We have approximately 75 stores along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts that are coveredby third party insurance but are self-insured for property and merchandise losses related to ""named storms""; therefore, repair and replacement costs will be borne by us for damage to anyof these stores from ""named storms"".  We rely on third party suppliers to obtain materials and provide production facilities from which we source our merchandise.          We may experience supply problems such as unfavorable pricing or untimely delivery of merchandise. The price and availability ofmaterials from suppliers can be adversely affected by factors outside of our control, such as increased worldwide demand. Further, our suppliers may experience financial difficulties due to a downturnin the industry or in other macroeconomic environments, such as credit markets, stifling their ability to obtain borrowed funds necessary to finance their operations. These supplier risks may have amaterial adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 4 Table of Contents We may evaluate acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic initiatives, any of which could distract management or otherwise have a negative effect on revenues, costsand stock price.          Our future success may depend on opportunities to buy or obtain rights to other businesses or technologies that could complement,enhance or expand our current business or products or that might otherwise offer growth opportunities. In particular, we intend to evaluate potential mergers, acquisitions, joint venture investments,strategic initiatives, alliances, vertical integration opportunities and divestitures. Our attempt to engage in these transactions may expose us to various inherent risks,including:assessing the value, future growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potentialprofitability of acquisition candidates; the potential loss of key personnel of an acquired business; the ability to achieve projected economic and operating synergies; difficulties successfully integrating, operating, maintaining and managing newly acquired operations or employees;  difficulties maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;  unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business;  the possibility of impairment charges if an acquired business performs below expectations; and  the diversion of management's attention from the existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of theacquired or combined business or to implement the strategic initiative.  Our annual and quarterly financial results may fluctuate depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control, and if we fail to meet the expectations ofsecurities analysts or investors, our share price may decline.          Our sales and operating results can vary from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on various factors, many of which arebeyond our control. Certain events and factors may directly and immediately decrease demand for our products or increase operating costs. If customer demand decreased or if operating costs increasedrapidly, our results of operations would also decline precipitously. The recent passage of health care legislation will cause the Company's operating costs to rise in fiscal 2014 and beyond. TheCompany is currently in the process of assessing the extent of the effect of the legislation on its operating costs. Other events and factors include:changes in competitive and economic conditions generally; variations in the timing and volume of our sales; sales promotions by us or our competitors; changes in average same-store sales and customer visits; changes in legislation, affecting such matters as credit card income; variations in the price (including purchase discounts), availability and shipping costs of merchandise;  seasonal effects on demand for our products; changes in the cost or availability of material or labor; and weather and acts of God. 5 Table of Contents Litigation with customers, employees and others could harm our reputation and impact operating results.          Lawsuits have been filed, and may continue to be filed, by customers and employees alleging discrimination. We are also susceptible toclaims filed by customers alleging responsibility for injury suffered during a visit to a store. Further, we may be subject to other claims in the future based on, among other things, employeediscrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and wage issues, including those relating to overtime compensation. These types of claims, as well as other types of lawsuits to which we are subjectfrom time to time, can distract management's attention from core business operations and/or negatively impact operating results.  Catastrophic events may disrupt our business.          Unforeseen events, including war, terrorism and other international conflicts, public health issues, and natural disasters such asearthquakes, hurricanes or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt international trade and supply chainefficiencies, suppliers or customers, or result in political or economic instability. These events could result in property losses, reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible toreceive products from suppliers.

Reductions in the income and cash flow from our long-term marketing and servicing alliance related to our proprietary credit cards could impact operating resultsand cash flows.          GE owns and manages our proprietary credit cards under the Alliance that expires in fiscal 2014. The Alliance provides for certainpayments to be made by GE to the Company, including a revenue sharing and marketing reimbursement.

Actual future performance, outcomes and results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by the Company andits management as a result of a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.  The retail merchandise business is highly competitive, and that competition could lower revenues, margins and market share.          We conduct our retail merchandise business under highly competitive conditions. Although we are a large regional department store, wehave numerous competitors at the national and local level that compete with our individual stores, including specialty, off-price, discount, Internet and mail-order retailers.Competition is characterized by many factors including location, reputation, fashion, merchandise assortment, advertising, price, quality, service and credit availability. We anticipate that intensecompetition will continue. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience downward pressure on prices, lower demand for products, reduced margins, the inability to takeadvantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share.  Changes in economic, market and other conditions could adversely affect our operating results.          The retail merchandise business is affected by changes in international, national, regional, and local economic conditions, consumerpreferences and spending patterns, demographic trends, consumer confidence, consumer credit availability, weather, traffic patterns, the type, number and location of competing stores, and the effectsof war or terrorist activities and any governmental responses thereto. Factors such as inflation, apparel costs, labor and benefit costs, legal claims, and the availability of management and hourlyemployees also affect store operations and administrative expenses. Our ability to finance new store development, improvements and additions to existing stores, and the acquisition of stores fromcompetitors is affected by economic conditions, including interest rates and other government policies impacting land and construction costs and the availability of borrowed funds.  Current store locations may become less desirable, and desirable new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all.          The success of any store depends substantially upon its location. There can be no assurance that current locations will continue to bedesirable as demographic patterns change. Neighborhood or economic conditions where stores are located could decline in the future, thus resulting in potentially reduced sales in those locations. Ifwe cannot obtain desirable locations at reasonable prices, our cost structure will increase and our revenues will be adversely affected.  Ownership and leasing of significant amounts of real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses.          We own the land and building, or lease the land and/or the building, for all of our stores. Accordingly, we are subject to all of therisks associated with owning and leasing real estate. In particular, the value of the assets could decrease, and their operating costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate forreal estate, demographic trends and supply or demand for the use of the store, which may result from competition from similar stores in the area, as well as liability for environmental conditions. Ifan existing owned store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be required to record an impairment charge and/or exit costs associated with the disposal of the store. We generally cannotcancel our leases. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be committed to perform certain obligations under the applicable lease including, among otherthings, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each of the leases expires, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all,which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations. We may not be able to close an unprofitable owned store due to an existing operating covenant which may cause us to operate the location ata loss and prevent us from finding a more desirable location. We have approximately 4 Table of Contents75 storesalong the Gulf and Atlantic coasts that are covered by third party insurance but are self-insured for property and merchandise losses related to ""named storms""; therefore,repair and replacement costs will be borne by us for damage to any of these stores from ""named storms"".  We rely on third party suppliers to obtain materials and provide production facilities from which we source our merchandise.          We may experience supply problems such as unfavorable pricing or untimely delivery of merchandise. The price and availability ofmaterials from suppliers can be adversely affected by factors outside of our control, such as increased worldwide demand. Further, our suppliers who also serve the retail industry may experiencefinancial difficulties due to a downturn in the industry or in other macroeconomic environments, such as credit markets, stifling their ability to obtain borrowed funds necessary to finance theiroperations. These supplier risks may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  We may evaluate acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic initiatives, any of which could distract management or otherwise have a negative effect on revenues, costsand stock price.          Our future success may depend on opportunities to buy or obtain rights to other businesses or technologies that could complement,enhance or expand our current business or products or that might otherwise offer growth opportunities. In particular, we intend to evaluate potential mergers, acquisitions, joint venture investments,strategic initiatives, alliances, vertical integration opportunities and divestitures. Our attempt to engage in these transactions may expose us to various inherent risks,including: assessing the value, future growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potentialprofitability of acquisition candidates;   the potential loss of key personnel of an acquired business;   the ability to achieve projected economic and operating synergies;   difficulties successfully integrating, operating, maintaining and managing newly acquired operations or employees;  difficulties maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;   unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business;   the possibility of impairment charges if an acquired business performs below expectations; and   the diversion of management's attention from the existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of theacquired or combined business or to implement the strategic initiative.  Our annual and quarterly financial results may fluctuate depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control, and if we fail to meet the expectations ofsecurities analysts or investors, our share price may decline.          Our sales and operating results can vary from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on various factors, many of which arebeyond our control. Certain events and factors may directly and immediately decrease demand for our products or increase operating costs. If customer demand decreased or if operating costs increasedrapidly, our results of operations would also decline precipitously. The recent passage of health care legislation will cause the Company's operating costs to rise in fiscal 2014 and beyond. TheCompany is currently in the process of assessing the extent of the effect of the legislation on its operating costs. Other events and factors include: changes in competitive and economic conditions generally; 5 Table of Contentsvariations in the timing and volume of our sales;   sales promotions by us or our competitors;   changes in average same-store sales and customer visits;   changes in legislation, affecting such matters as credit card income;   variations in the price (including purchase discounts), availability and shipping costs of merchandise;  seasonal effects on demand for our products;   changes in the cost or availability of material or labor; and   weather and acts of God.  Litigation with customers, employees and others could harm our reputation and impact operating results.          Lawsuits have been filed, and may continue to be filed, from customers and employees alleging discrimination. We are also susceptibleto claims filed by customers alleging responsibility for injury suffered during a visit to a store. Further, we may be subject to other claims in the future based on, among other things, employeediscrimination, harassment, wrongful termination and wage issues, including those relating to overtime compensation. These types of claims, as well as other types of lawsuits to which we are subjectfrom time to time, can distract management's attention from core business operations and/or negatively impact operating results.  Catastrophic events may disrupt our business.          Unforeseen events, including war, terrorism and other international conflicts, public health issues, and natural disasters such asearthquakes, hurricanes or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, could disrupt our operations, disrupt international trade and supply chainefficiencies, suppliers or customers, or result in political or economic instability. These events could result in property losses, reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible toreceive products from suppliers.  Variations in the amount of vendor allowances received could adversely impact our operating results.          We receive vendor allowances for advertising, payroll and margin maintenance that are a strategic part of our operations. A reductionin the amount of cooperative advertising allowances would likely cause us to consider other methods of advertising as well as the volume and frequency of our product advertising, which couldincrease/decrease our expenditures and/or revenue. Decreased payroll reimbursements would either cause payroll costs to rise, negatively impacting operating income, or cause us to reduce the number ofemployees, which may cause a decline in sales. A decline in the amount of margin maintenance allowances would either increase cost of sales, which would negatively impact gross margin and operatingincome, or cause us to reduce merchandise purchases, which may cause a decline in sales.  A privacy breach could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial condition.          The protection of customer, employee and Company data is critical to us. The regulatory environment surrounding information securityand privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. We receive certain personal information about our customers and employees. In addition,our online operations at www.dillards.com depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. A compromise of oursecurity systems that results in personal information being 6 Table of Contentsobtainedby unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our customers, employees and others, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity,and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. In addition, a security breach could requirethat we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our online sales operations.  Changes in the income and cash flow from our long-term marketing and servicing alliance related to our proprietary credit cards could impact operating resultsand cash flows.          GE owns and manages our proprietary credit cards under the Alliance that expires in fiscal 2014. The Alliance provides for certainpayments to be made by GE to the Company, including a revenue sharing and marketing reimbursement. The income and cash flow that the Company receives from the Alliance is dependent upon a number offactors including the level of sales on GE accounts, the level of balances carried on the GE accounts by GE customers, payment rates on GE accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on GE accounts,the level of credit losses for the GE accounts, GE's ability to extend credit to our customers as well as GE's funding costs, all of which can vary based on changes in federal and state banking andconsumer protection laws and from a variety of economic, legal, social and other factors that we cannot control.  The percentage-of-completion method of accounting for contract revenues may result in material adjustments, which could result in a charge againstour earnings.          Our construction segment recognizes contract revenues using the percentage-of-completion method. Under thismethod, estimated contract revenues are recognized by applying the percentage of completion of the project for the period to the total estimated revenues for the contract. Estimated contract lossesare recognized in full when determined. Total contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum on a quarterly basis as the work progresses and as change orders are approved.Adjustments based upon the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues in the period when these estimates are revised. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, areduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit, we recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material"
