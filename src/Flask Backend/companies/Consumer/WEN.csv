12,WEN,WENDY'S CO,2024-02-26,"Risk Factors
.We wish to caution readers that in addition to the important factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we have included below certain material factors that have affected, or in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results during fiscal 2024, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.Risks Related to Macroeconomic and Industry ConditionsCompetition from other restaurant companies, as well as grocery chains and other retail food outlets, or poor customer experience at Wendy’s restaurants, could hurt our brand.The market segments in which Wendy’s restaurants compete are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, price and value perception, food quality and presentation, product innovation, service, location, convenience, digital engagement and the nature and condition of the restaurant facility.  If customers have a poor experience at a Wendy’s restaurant, whether at a Company-operated or franchised restaurant, we may experience a decrease in customer counts.  Further, Wendy’s restaurants compete with a variety of locally owned restaurants, as well as competitive regional, national and global restaurant chains.  Additionally, many of our competitors have introduced lower cost value meal menu options and have employed marketing strategies that include frequent use of price discounting (including through the use of coupons and other offers), frequent promotions and heavy advertising expenditures.  Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing, marketing and operational strategies better than we can and drive higher levels of brand awareness among consumers.  This product and price competition could result in reduced revenues and loss of market share.Moreover, new companies, including operators outside the quick-service restaurant industry, may enter market areas in which Wendy’s restaurants operate and target our customer base.  For example, additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases have come from deli sections and in-store cafes of a number of major grocery store chains, as well as from convenience stores, casual dining outlets and food delivery providers.  Such competitors may have, among other things, lower operating costs, better locations, better facilities, more effective marketing and more efficient operations.  Wendy’s also competes with grocery chains and other retail outlets or concepts that sell food to be prepared at home.  Competition with these chains and other outlets could increase based on the gap between the price of food prepared at home compared to the price of food purchased at restaurants.  This increased product and price competition could put deflationary pressure on the selling price of products offered at Wendy’s restaurants.  All such competition may adversely affect our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.Adverse economic conditions or disruptions in the national and global economies, or in regions that have a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants, could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.Adverse economic conditions or disruptions in the national and global economies could result in higher unemployment rates, labor shortages, increases in inflation and interest rates and declines in consumer confidence and spending.  If such disruptions occur, they may result in significant declines in consumer food-away-from-home spending and customer counts in Wendy’s restaurants.    Ongoing disruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Additionally, adverse economic conditions in regions that contain a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants, including markets in which Company-operated restaurants are located, could also have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.Changes in discretionary consumer spending, and in consumer tastes and preferences, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The success of the Wendy’s system depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income.  Material declines in the amount of discretionary spending or consumer food-away-from-home spending, or significant increases in expenses incurred by consumers, such as living expenses or gasoline prices, could hurt our business, results of operations and financial condition.    Our success also depends to a large extent on continued consumer acceptance of, and demand for, our offerings, the success of our operating, growth, promotional, marketing and new product development initiatives and the reputation of our brand.  If we are unable to continue to achieve consumer acceptance or adapt to changes in consumer demographics or preferences, including with respect to nutrition, health or dietary trends, environmental or social concerns or the use of digital channels, Wendy’s 16restaurants may lose customers, and the resulting revenues from Company-operated restaurants and the royalties that we receive from franchisees may decline.COVID-19 has disrupted and could continue to disrupt our business, which has materially affected and could continue to materially affect our results of operations, financial condition and prospects.COVID-19 adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our business.  Our customer counts and systemwide sales were significantly negatively impacted by COVID-19 and customers may continue to be reluctant to return to in-restaurant dining.  Our restaurant operations have been and could continue to be disrupted by COVID-19, including restaurant and dining room closures, labor shortages or increased labor costs.  Furthermore, COVID-19 has led, and could again lead, to interruptions in the delivery of food or other supplies to Wendy’s restaurants closures of supplier or distributor facilities or financial distress of suppliers or distributors.  Our results of operations and those of our franchisees could be adversely affected if our key suppliers or distributors are unable to fulfill their responsibilities and we are unable to timely identify and transition the impacted business to alternative suppliers or distributors.  COVID-19 has had, and could again have, an adverse effect on new restaurant development, as well as on our franchisees’ operations and financial condition.  In addition to the risks described above, COVID-19 has had, and could continue to have, the effect of heightening other risks disclosed in this risk factors section, including, but not limited to, those related to brand value and perception, consumer preferences and spending, our ability to achieve or maintain market share, new restaurant development, commodity costs, labor, supply chain and purchasing and international operations.  We cannot predict the ultimate duration, scope or severity of COVID-19 or its ultimate impact on our results of operations, financial condition and prospects.Risks Related to Brand Perception and ValueOur success depends substantially on our corporate reputation and on the value and perception of our brand.Our success depends in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brand, our customers’ loyalty to our brand and a positive relationship with our franchisees and other business partners.  Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities.  Erosion of trust in our brand can be caused by isolated or recurring incidents originating from us, our franchisees or our business partners, or from external events.  Such incidents can significantly reduce brand value and consumer trust, particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation.  For example, our brand could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality or safety of our products or the quality or reputation of our employees, franchisees or other business partners, regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are true.  Our brand could also be adversely impacted by other incidents described in this risk factors section, including incidents related to customer service, health or safety, a failure to attract and retain qualified employees, food safety or other health concerns regarding our products, the impact of social media, data privacy violations, cyber incidents, environmental, social and governance matters or reports of our employees, franchisees or business partners taking controversial positions or acting in an unethical, illegal or socially irresponsible manner.  Any such incidents could cause a decline in consumer confidence in our brand and reduce consumer demand for our products, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our results of operations and the value and perception of our brand depend in part on the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs and the successful development and launch of new products.Our results of operations and the value and perception of our brand are heavily influenced by brand marketing and advertising and by our ability to develop and launch new and innovative products.  Our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful, or we may fail to develop commercially successful new products, which may impact our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and the value and perception of our brand.  Moreover, because franchisees contribute to advertising funds based on a percentage of sales at their franchised restaurants, our advertising fund expenditures are dependent upon sales volumes across the Wendy’s system.  If systemwide sales decline, this could result in a reduced amount of funds available for our marketing and advertising programs.  In addition, to the extent we use value offerings or other promotions or discounts in our marketing and advertising programs to drive customer counts, these actions may condition our customers to resist higher menu prices or result in reduced demand for premium products.17Our inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the impact of social media could adversely impact our brand, business and results of operations.Social media platforms, including forms of internet-based communications, allow individuals access to a broad audience.  The availability of information on social media platforms is virtually immediate and has given users the ability to more effectively organize collective actions such as boycotts and other brand-damaging behaviors.  The dissemination of information by customers, employees, social media influencers and others via social media, whether accurate or inaccurate, could harm our business, brand, reputation, results of operation and financial condition.  This damage may be immediate, without an opportunity to correct inaccurate information or respond to or address particular issues.  In addition, as part of our marketing efforts, we frequently use social media to communicate with consumers in order to build their awareness of, engagement with and loyalty to our brand.  Our failure to use social media effectively or appropriately, particularly as compared to our competitors, could lead to a decline in brand value, customer visits and revenues.  Laws and regulations governing the use of social media continue to rapidly evolve.  A failure by us, our employees, our franchisees or third parties acting on our behalf to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of social media could adversely impact our reputation, brand, results of operations and financial condition or subject us to litigation, fines or other penalties.  Social media risks could also arise from our employees, franchisees or business partners not following defined policies for the use of social media during business operations, or actions taken by employees during personal activities outside of their employment, but which could still reflect negatively on the Wendy’s brand.We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and hurt our business.Our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business.  We rely on a combination of trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and other intellectual property.  The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our continued ability to use our trademarks and service marks to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in existing and new markets.  If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, or if any third party misappropriates, infringes, dilutes or otherwise violates our intellectual property, the value of our brand may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  While we try to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by our franchisees, we cannot ensure that franchisees will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property or the reputation of the Wendy’s brand or restaurant system.  Any damage or violation of our intellectual property could harm our image, brand or competitive position and result in significant legal fees and the diversion of resources.  If we do not attempt or are unable to successfully protect, maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights, there could be a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations as a result of, among other things, consumer confusion, dilution of the Wendy’s brand or increased competition from unauthorized users of our brand.We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions.  Not all of the trademarks or domain names that are used in the Wendy’s system have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business or may do business in the future, and some trademarks will never be registered in all of these countries.  Some countries’ laws make unregistered trademarks more difficult to enforce, or do not protect them at all, and third parties have filed, or may in the future file, for “Wendy’s” or similar marks.  Accordingly, we may not be able to adequately protect the Wendy’s brand everywhere in the world and use of the Wendy’s brand may result in liability for trademark infringement, trademark dilution or unfair competition.  In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.  We cannot ensure that all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate.We cannot ensure that third parties will not bring infringement claims against us in the future.  Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, cause delays in introducing new menu items, require costly modifications to advertising and promotional materials, harm our brand, image, competitive position or ability to expand our operations into other jurisdictions, cause us to incur significant costs related to defense or settlement or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.  As a result, any such claim could harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, third parties may assert that certain of our intellectual property, or our rights therein, are invalid or unenforceable.  If our rights in any of our intellectual property were found to infringe third-party rights, or portions thereof were deemed invalid or unenforceable, we may be forced to defend or resolve related claims and incur related expenses.  In addition, such loss of rights could permit competing uses of such intellectual property which, in turn, could harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.18Food safety events or health concerns regarding our products could create negative publicity and adversely affect our brand, business and results of operations.Food safety is a top priority for Wendy’s, and we dedicate substantial resources to food safety matters to ensure our customers enjoy safe, quality food products.  However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. coli), have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future.  For example, in August 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”) began investigating a multistate outbreak of E. coli in which many of the impacted individuals reported having eaten at a Wendy’s restaurant and most reported consuming sandwich romaine lettuce.  The Company cooperated with the CDC’s investigation and, as a precautionary measure, removed sandwich romaine lettuce from its restaurants in the relevant region.  In October 2022, the CDC announced that the outbreak was over and that the specific source of the outbreak had not been confirmed.  The Company was referenced in news stories related to the outbreak, and the Company (and others) have been named in various claims and lawsuits related to the outbreak.  Food safety events, whether or not involving Wendy’s restaurants or other restaurant companies, could adversely affect the price and availability of certain products and result in negative publicity for Wendy’s or the restaurant industry.  This negative publicity may reduce demand for Wendy’s food and could result in a decrease in customer counts to Wendy’s restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types.  Any report linking our restaurants or suppliers to food-borne illnesses, food tampering, contamination or mislabeling or other food-safety issues could damage the value of our brand immediately and severely hurt sales of our products and possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) or other damages.  The Wendy’s system may also be adversely impacted by consumer or regulatory concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of the products we sell, the ingredients in our products or the cooking processes or packaging used in our restaurants.  These or similar concerns could result in less demand for our products and a decline in sales at Company-operated restaurants and in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.Risks Related to Our Business StrategyWe may be unable to deliver accelerated global sales growth or achieve or maintain market share across our dayparts.Our business strategy includes a focus on driving sales momentum across all of our dayparts through quality differentiation, exciting menu innovation and compelling value offerings.  However, we may be unable to deliver accelerated global sales growth or achieve or maintain market share across our dayparts due to competitive pressures and other factors, such as consumer tastes and preferences, the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs, the successful development and launch of new products, commodity and labor costs, providing fast and accurate customer experiences, further accelerating our digital business, driving new restaurant development and ensuring the support and engagement of franchisees.  For example, Wendy’s recently entered the breakfast daypart in the United States and Canada with a breakfast program designed to drive incremental sales and profits through a strong economic model.  The breakfast daypart has required and may continue to require significant financial resources, including the Company’s plans to fund incremental marketing and advertising campaigns.  Our inability to successfully execute on our strategy for the breakfast daypart and reach targeted levels of sales and profits could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our predominantly franchised business model presents a number of risks.As of December 31, 2023, approximately 95% of restaurants in the Wendy’s system were operated by franchisees.  Wendy’s franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with the standards set forth in our franchise and other agreements with them.  Wendy’s also provides training and support to franchisees.  However, franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants.  Specifically, franchisees are solely responsible for developing and utilizing their own policies and procedures, making their own hiring, firing and disciplinary decisions, scheduling hours and establishing wages and managing their day-to-day employment processes and procedures in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, all of which is done independent of Wendy’s.  Further, franchisees have discretion as to the prices charged to customers.  As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee.  If franchisees do not successfully operate their restaurants in a manner consistent with required standards, their royalty payments to us could be adversely affected and our brand’s image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn, could hurt our business and results of operations.  In addition, the failure of franchisees to adequately engage in succession planning may adversely affect their restaurant operations and development of new Wendy’s restaurants, which in turn could hurt our business and results of operations.Wendy’s franchisees are an integral part of our business, growth and brand strategies, and difficulties in identifying, attracting and retaining franchisees who meet our criteria could harm our business and brand.  Our business and results of 19operations could be adversely affected if a significant number of franchisees do not participate in brand strategies, such as new restaurant development, Image Activation, marketing and menu programs and digital commerce platforms and technologies, which in turn may harm our business and financial condition.  In addition, Wendy’s current franchise model, and the way our brand strategies are executed across the system, may make it difficult for our brand to respond and adapt to the speed of changes in technology, consumer preferences or other factors as quickly as may be required to maintain and grow market share and remain competitive.  Certain of our competitors that have a significantly higher percentage of company-operated restaurants than we do may have greater influence over their respective restaurant systems and greater ability to implement operational initiatives and business strategies.We receive revenues in the form of royalties and national advertising funds contributions (both of which are generally based on a percentage of sales at franchised restaurants), as well as rent and fees from franchisees.  Accordingly, a substantial portion of our financial results is to a large extent dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees.  If sales trends or economic conditions worsen for franchisees, or if the overall business or financial health of franchisees deteriorates, their results of operations or financial condition may worsen, which could result in, among other things, increased restaurant closures, decreased restaurant openings, required financial support or franchisee bankruptcies or restructuring activities, all of which could reduce our royalty, national advertising funds, rent and other fee revenues.  Furthermore, an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding involving a franchisee could prevent or delay us from collecting payments or exercising any of our other rights under the franchise or other related agreement with such franchisee.  Additionally, when Company-operated restaurants with leased real estate are sold to franchisees, we are often required to remain responsible for lease payments for these restaurants in the event the purchasing franchisees default on their leases.  Similarly, when we lease or sublease properties to franchisees, we remain responsible for certain expenses related to the properties, such as lease payments and maintenance charges.  If franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements or fail to perform under or extend their leases or subleases with us, or if we are unable to identify, attract and retain new franchisees who meet our criteria, then our royalty and rental revenues may decrease and our future growth could be adversely affected.The growth of our business is dependent on new restaurant openings, which could be affected by factors beyond our control.Our business derives earnings from sales at Company-operated restaurants as well as royalties and other fees received from franchised restaurants.  Growth in our revenues and earnings is dependent on new restaurant openings.  Numerous factors beyond our control may adversely affect new restaurant openings, which in turn could hurt our business and results of operations.  These factors include, among others: (i) our ability to attract new franchisees; (ii) the level of participation in, and success of, our build to suit development fund; (iii) the availability of site locations for new restaurants; (iv) the ability of restaurant owners to obtain financing; (v) the ability of restaurant owners to attract, train and retain qualified operating personnel; (vi) construction and development costs; (vii) the ability of restaurant owners to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all; (viii) the ability of us and our franchises to execute our development strategy for non-traditional restaurants, such as fuel and transportation centers, food courts and other retail locations, military bases and delivery kitchens; and (ix) adverse weather conditions.  Our inability to identify suitable locations, achieve consumer acceptance or otherwise execute our development strategy could have an adverse impact on our future growth, results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, the growth of our business could be adversely impacted by higher-than-expected restaurant closures, including closures related to underperformance, market conditions, macroeconomic or demographic trends, expiration or loss of leases, franchisee health or other factors beyond our control.Our Image Activation program may not positively affect sales or improve our results of operations, and franchisees may not participate in our Image Activation program to the extent expected by us.We continue to execute our Image Activation program, which includes reimaging existing Wendy’s restaurants and building new Wendy’s restaurants with innovative exterior and interior restaurant designs.  Our Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at Wendy’s restaurants or improve our results of operations.  There can also be no assurance that franchisees will participate in the Image Activation program to the extent expected by the Company.  In order to support our Image Activation program and promote new restaurant development, we have provided franchisees with certain incentive programs for qualifying new and reimaged restaurants, including waivers or reductions in royalty, national advertising and technical assistance fees and options for the early renewal of franchise agreements.  It is possible we may provide additional financial incentives to franchisees, which could result in additional expenses, a reduction of royalties or other revenues or the incurrence of other costs or liabilities.  Some franchisees may need to borrow funds in order to reimage existing restaurants or build new restaurants under the Image Activation program.  If franchisees are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, they may be unwilling or unable to invest in the reimaging of their existing restaurants or the development of new restaurants, and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.20We may be unable to manage effectively the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, or successfully implement other strategic initiatives, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results.We continue to optimize the Wendy’s system through our system optimization initiative, which includes facilitating the transfer of restaurants between and among franchisees, as well as evaluating strategic acquisitions of franchised restaurants and strategic dispositions of Company-operated restaurants to existing and new franchisees, to further strengthen the franchisee base, drive new restaurant development and accelerate completion of our Image Activation program.  The success of this initiative is dependent upon many factors, such as the availability of sellers and buyers, the availability of financing, the ability to negotiate transactions on terms deemed acceptable and the ability to successfully transition and integrate restaurant operations.  Acquisitions of franchised restaurants pose various risks to our operations, including (i) diversion of management’s attention to the integration of acquired restaurant operations; (ii) increased operating expenses and the inability to achieve expected cost savings and operating efficiencies; and (iii) the assumption of long-term, non-cancelable leases.  Our system optimization initiative also places demands on our operational and financial management resources and may require us to expand these resources.  If we are unable to execute our system optimization initiative or effectively manage the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.In addition, Wendy’s from time to time evaluates and may pursue other opportunities for growth, including through new and existing franchise partners, joint venture investments, expansion of our brand through other opportunities and strategic mergers, acquisitions and divestitures.  These strategic initiatives involve various risks, including general transaction and business risk, integration and synergy risk, market acceptance risk and risks associated with the potential diversion of management’s attention.  Strategic transactions may not ultimately create value for us or our stockholders and may harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our leasing and ownership of significant amounts of real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses, including liabilities associated with environmental matters.We have significant real estate operations in connection with our business and are subject to the normal risks associated with owning, leasing and subleasing real estate.  Our real estate values and the costs associated with our real estate operations are impacted by a variety of factors, including changes in the investment climate for real estate, macroeconomic trends, governmental regulations, infrastructure, condemnation or eminent domain, insurance, demographic trends, supply chain management, supply and demand for the ownership and operation of restaurants and environmental matters.  A significant decrease in real estate values or increase in real estate costs could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances.  Third parties may also make claims against owners, operators or occupants of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of or exposure to such substances.  While we employ environmental review standards and practices in the current development of our real estate, we have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of all of our properties and we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our leased and owned properties, and any such liabilities identified in the future could cause us to incur significant costs, including costs associated with litigation, fines or clean-up responsibilities.  We cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with any environmental laws or regulations or to satisfy any such claims.We generally secure long-term real estate interests for our leased restaurants and have limited flexibility to quickly alter our real estate portfolio.  Many leases provide that the rent will increase over the term of the lease and any renewals of the term.  Most leases require us to pay the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance, utilities and capital repairs and replacements.  We generally cannot cancel these leases prior to the expiration of their term.  If an existing or future restaurant is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying rent, taxes and maintenance costs for the balance of the lease term.  In addition, as our leases expire, we may fail to negotiate additional renewals or renewal options, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close restaurants in desirable locations, negatively impacting our results of operations.21Our international operations are subject to various risks and uncertainties and there is no assurance that our international operations will continue to be profitable.In addition to many of the factors described in this risk factors section, our business outside of the United States is subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including international economic and political conditions, risk of corruption and violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws of other countries, the inability to adapt to differing cultures or consumer preferences, inadequate brand infrastructure to support our international activities, inability to obtain adequate supplies meeting our quality standards and product specifications or interruptions in obtaining such supplies, challenges and risks associated with managing and monitoring suppliers, restrictions on our ability to move cash out of certain foreign countries, currency regulations and fluctuations, diverse government regulations and tax systems, uncertain or differing interpretations of rights and obligations in connection with international franchise agreements, the collection of royalties and other fees from international franchisees, the inability to protect technology, data or intellectual property rights, compliance with international privacy and information security laws and regulations, the availability and cost of land, construction costs, other legal, financial or regulatory impediments to the development or operation of restaurants, the inability to identify, attract and retain experienced management, qualified franchisees and joint venture partners and disruptions and impacts from COVID-19.  Adverse conditions or unforeseen events in countries that contain a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants (including Canada, our largest international market), could have a material adverse impact on our international growth strategy and results of operations.  In addition, to the extent we invest in international Company-operated restaurants or joint ventures, we would also have the risk of operating losses related to those restaurants, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  There can be no assurance that our international growth strategy will be successful or that our international operations will be profitable.For example, Wendy’s entered the United Kingdom in 2021, plans to expand into other anchor markets in Europe utilizing a franchise model and intends to accelerate restaurant development in other new and existing international markets.  New and emerging markets may have lower brand awareness as well as competitive conditions, consumer tastes and preferences, discretionary spending patterns and social and cultural differences that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets.  We may need to make greater investments than we originally planned in advertising and promotional activity to build brand awareness, which could negatively impact the profitability of our operations.  In addition, we and our franchisees may be unable to obtain desirable locations for new restaurants at reasonable prices, or at all, and restaurants may have higher construction, occupancy, food and labor costs than we currently anticipate.  Any of these risks and uncertainties, and other factors we cannot anticipate, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Risks Related to Supply Chain and LaborChanges in commodity costs and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations.Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken, pork, dairy and grains), supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs, including labor costs.  Increases in commodity costs have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our results of operations.  Our business is susceptible to increases in commodity and other operating costs as a result of various factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, inflation, industry demand, energy costs, food safety concerns, animal disease outbreaks, product recalls   and government regulations.  Increasing weather volatility or other long-term changes in weather patterns, including related to climate change, could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of our ingredients.  In addition, our supply chain is subject to increased costs arising from actual or perceived effects of climate change, greenhouse gas emissions and scarcity of energy and water resources.  The ongoing and long-term costs of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business if not properly mitigated.  We could also be adversely impacted by the cost of products raised or grown in accordance with our responsible sourcing criteria, including those related to environmental sustainability and animal welfare, as the availability of products that can be assured to meet those criteria are generally smaller and more concentrated, and may be more costly, than the markets for conventionally raised or grown products that are not assured to meet those criteria.  We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing commodity costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our results of operations.  In addition, we may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to our customers.  If increased costs were passed to our customers, demand for our products may decrease, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations.22Shortages or interruptions in the supply or distribution of perishable food products could damage our brand and adversely affect our business and results of operations.Wendy’s and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet brand specifications.  Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, labor shortages, disease or food-borne illnesses, political unrest, health epidemics or pandemics, inclement weather or other calamities or conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which could lower revenues, increase operating costs, damage brand reputation and otherwise harm our business and the businesses of our franchisees.  Certain of the products sold in our restaurants, such as beef and chicken, are sourced from a limited number of suppliers, which may increase our reliance on those suppliers.  In addition, our system relies on a limited number of in-line distributors to deliver certain food, packaging and beverage products to our restaurants.  If a disruption of service from any of our key suppliers or distributors was to occur, including as a result of a failure to meet our quality or safety standards, we could experience short-term increases in our costs while supply and distribution channels were adjusted, and we may be unable to identify or negotiate with new suppliers or distributors on terms that are commercially reasonable to us.We do not exercise ultimate control over purchasing for our restaurant system, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.While we require and seek to ensure that all suppliers to the Wendy’s system meet certain quality control standards, our franchisees ultimately control the purchasing of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies from third party suppliers through QSCC, Wendy’s independent purchasing co-op.  QSCC manages, for the Wendy’s system in the United States and Canada, contracts for the purchase and distribution of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies under national agreements with pricing based on total system volume.  We do not control the decisions and activities of QSCC.  If QSCC does not properly estimate the product needs of the Wendy’s system, makes poor purchasing decisions or ceases its operations, or if our relationship with QSCC is terminated for any reason, system sales, operating costs and supply chain management could be adversely affected, which could harm us and our franchisees and have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our business could be hurt by increased labor costs or labor shortages.Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our restaurants.  We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our restaurant personnel, including managers and hourly employees.  Increased labor costs due to competition, inflationary pressures, increased wages or employee benefits costs (including various federal, state and local actions to increase minimum wages and enhance workplace conditions) or other factors have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our cost of sales and operating expenses.  In addition, Wendy’s success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and staff as well as employees and key personnel at our restaurant support center, and our inability to do so could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  Our business, results of operations and brand perception could also be adversely impacted by unionization efforts or other campaigns by labor organizations affecting our employees or the employees of our franchisees or by our responses to any such efforts or campaigns.Our success depends in part upon the continued succession and retention of certain key personnel and the effectiveness of our leadership and organizational structure.We believe that over time our success has been dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior leadership team and other key personnel.  Our failure to retain members of our senior leadership team or other key personnel could adversely affect our ability to achieve our growth strategy and other business initiatives.  In addition, changes to our leadership and organizational structure, including our recent Chief Executive Officer succession, can be inherently difficult to manage, and if we are unable to implement such changes effectively, our business, results of operations and financial results could be adversely affected.Risks Related to Technology and CybersecurityThere are risks and uncertainties associated with our digital commerce strategies, platforms and technologies.Advances in technologies, including advances in digital food ordering and delivery technologies, and changes in consumer behavior driven by such advances could have a negative effect on our business.  Technology and consumer offerings continue to develop and evolve, and we expect that new and enhanced technologies and consumer offerings will be available in the 23future, including those with a focus on restaurant modernization, restaurant technology, digital engagement and integration, artificial intelligence (“AI”), online ordering and delivery.  Our inability to predict consumer acceptance of new technology or our failure to adequately invest in and implement new technology or adapt to technological developments, industry trends and evolving legal and regulatory requirements could result in a loss of customers and related market share.  In addition, our competitors, some of whom have greater resources than we do, may be better able to benefit from changes in technologies or consumer acceptance of such changes, which could harm our competitive position and brand.An increasing amount of our sales and revenues is derived from digital orders, including online ordering and delivery.  We have implemented and will continue to implement technology investments and targeted advertising and promotions to support the growth of our digital business.  If we are unable to continue to grow our digital business, it may be difficult for us to achieve our planned sales growth.  If our digital commerce platforms and strategies, including our planned investments to support digital growth through enhancements to the Wendy’s mobile app, loyalty program and personalized marketing capabilities and the rollout and implementation of digital menu boards, do not meet customers’ expectations in terms of security, privacy, speed, attractiveness or ease of use, customers may be less inclined to return to those platforms, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our business could also be negatively impacted if we are unable to successfully implement or execute other consumer-facing digital initiatives, such as mobile order pick-up and carryout.  We rely on third-party delivery services to fulfill delivery orders, and errors or failures by those providers to make timely deliveries could cause customers to stop ordering from us.  The third-party restaurant delivery business is intensely competitive, with a number of companies competing for capital, market share, online traffic and delivery drivers.  If the third-party delivery services that we utilize cease or curtail their operations, increase their fees or provide greater priority or promotions on their platforms to our competitors, our delivery business and our sales may be negatively impacted.  In addition, the delivery business has been consolidating and may continue to consolidate, which may give third-party delivery companies more leverage in negotiating the terms and pricing of contracts, which could in turn negatively impact our profits from this channel.We are heavily dependent on computer systems and information technology and any material failure, interruption or degradation of our systems or technology or issues with our key technology providers could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are heavily dependent on our computer systems and information technology, including those controlled by third-party providers, to conduct our business, including point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, technologies that support our digital and delivery solutions, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures.  Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and performance of our systems and technology.  The failure of our systems and technology to operate effectively, or an interruption or degradation in our systems or technology could be harmful and cause delays in customer service, result in the loss of digital sales or data, reduce efficiency or cause delays in operations.  Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any such problems or to maintain or upgrade our systems and technology or transition to replacement systems or technology.We are dependent to a significant extent on our ongoing relationship with key technology providers, including their personnel, resources, technological expertise, systems and technology and their ability to help execute our digital, restaurant technology and enterprise technology initiatives and support our technology innovation and growth initiatives.  The implementation and use of AI technologies present various risks and uncertainties, and the deficiencies or other failures of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability and brand or reputational harm.  The inability of us or our providers to successfully execute our technology growth initiatives while maintaining our brand value and perception could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in cybersecurity, could negatively impact our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.Cybersecurity incidents or breaches have, from time to time, occurred and may in the future occur involving our systems, the systems of our franchisees or the systems of third-party service providers.  Such cybersecurity incidents and breaches may include, without limitation, unauthorized access, phishing attacks, account takeovers, denial of service, computer viruses, introduction of malware or ransomware and other disruptive problems caused by malicious actors.  The rapid evolution and increased adoption of AI technologies may intensify our cybersecurity risks.  As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our systems, both internal and those managed by third parties.  Our business involves the collection and retention of customer data, including, in some instances, credit and debit card numbers and other personally identifiable information, in various information systems that we and our franchisees maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we and our franchisees contract to provide credit card processing, digital ordering and related services.  We also maintain important internal data, such as personally identifiable information about our employees and franchisees and information 24relating to our operations.  Our use of personally identifiable information is regulated by international, federal and state laws, as well as by certain third-party agreements.  As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, we will likely incur additional costs to ensure that we remain in compliance with those laws and regulations.  If our security and information systems are compromised or if our employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws, regulations or contract terms, and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect our reputation, disrupt our operations, damage our relationship with customers, franchisees or employees and result in costly litigation, judgments, or penalties resulting from violation of applicable laws and payment card industry regulations.  A cyber incident could also require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity or a loss in consumer confidence, sales and profits, increase fees payable to third parties or cause us to incur penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We have devoted considerable resources to secure our systems and technology against security breaches and have implemented various processes, procedures and controls to help mitigate the risk of a cyber incident.  However, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks change frequently and the measures we have taken do not guarantee that a cyber incident or security breach could not occur or that our business, reputation and financial condition will not be adversely affected.Risks Related to Our IndebtednessThe Company and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions, and substantially all of the assets of certain subsidiaries are security, under the terms of a securitized financing facility.Wendy’s Funding, LLC, a limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, is the master issuer (the “Master Issuer”) of outstanding senior secured notes under a securitized financing facility entered into in June 2015.  Under the facility, the Master Issuer issued and has outstanding certain series of fixed rate and variable funding notes (collectively, the “Senior Notes”).  The Senior Notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Master Issuer and certain other limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company that act as guarantors (collectively, the “Securitization Entities”), except for certain real estate assets and subject to certain limitations as set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes (the “Indenture”) and the related guarantee and collateral agreement.  The assets of the Securitization Entities include most of the domestic and certain of the foreign revenue-generating assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, which principally consist of franchise-related agreements, real estate assets, intellectual property and license agreements for the use of intellectual property.The Senior Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including that the Master Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Senior Notes, provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments under certain circumstances, certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, that the assets pledged as collateral for the Senior Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective and covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters.  The Senior Notes are also subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service coverage ratios, the sum of global gross sales for specified restaurants being below certain levels on certain measurement dates, certain manager termination events, the occurrence of an event of default and the failure to repay or refinance on the applicable scheduled maturity date.  The Senior Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal or other amounts due on or with respect to the Senior Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, the trustee under the Indenture ceasing to have valid and perfected security interests in certain collateral and certain judgments.  In the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the Indenture (including, without limitation, upon an event of default under the Indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the applicable term), the funds available to the Company would be reduced or eliminated, which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business.In addition, the Indenture and the related management agreement contain various covenants that limit the Company and its subsidiaries’ ability to engage in specified types of transactions, subject to certain exceptions, including, for example, to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, sell certain assets, create or incur liens on certain assets to secure indebtedness or consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets.  As a result of these restrictions, the Company may not have adequate resources or flexibility to continue to manage the business and provide for growth of the Wendy’s system, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future growth prospects, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.25We have a significant amount of debt outstanding, and such indebtedness could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.As of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately $2.8 billion of outstanding debt on its balance sheet.  Additionally, a subsidiary of the Company has issued variable funding notes, which allows for the borrowing of up to $300.0 million from time to time on a revolving basis.  This level of debt could have significant consequences on the Company’s future operations, including: (i) making it more difficult to meet payment and other obligations under outstanding debt; (ii) resulting in an event of default if the Company’s subsidiaries fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of the Company’s subsidiaries’ debt becoming immediately due and payable; (iii) reducing the availability of the Company’s cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, equity and debt repurchases, dividends, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; (iv) subjecting the Company to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on indebtedness with variable interest rates; (v) limiting the Company’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to, and increasing its vulnerability to, changes in the Company’s business or industry or the general economy; and (vi) placing the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that are less leveraged. The ability of the Company to make payments on, repay or refinance its debt, and to fund planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend largely upon its future operating performance and ability to generate significant cash flows.  In addition, the ability of the Company to borrow funds in the future to make payments on its debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in the securitized financing facility and other debt agreements, and other agreements it may enter into in the future.  There can be no assurance that the Company’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the Company’s securitized financing facility or other debt agreements or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable the Company to pay its debt or to fund its dividend and other liquidity needs.In addition to the Company’s outstanding indebtedness, the Company is subject to risks related to certain commitments, guarantees and other liabilities.  These commitments, guarantees and other liabilities include, among others, significant contractual requirements regarding the purchase of soft drinks, contractual requirements regarding certain marketing and media rights and guarantees and contingent liabilities related to certain franchisee leases for which the Company has been indemnified.  These commitments, guarantees and other liabilities could have an adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity and the ability of its subsidiaries to meet payment obligations.  The Company may incur additional indebtedness, guarantees, commitments or other liabilities in the future that could amplify the risks that the Company currently faces.Risks Related to Our Common StockThere can be no assurance regarding whether or to what extent we will pay dividends on our common stock in the future.Holders of our common stock will only be entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments.  Any dividends will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and such other factors as the Board may deem relevant from time to time.  In addition, because Wendy’s is a holding company, its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent upon cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand and cash flows from its subsidiaries.  The ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to the holding company is dependent upon their ability to achieve sufficient cash flows after satisfying their respective cash requirements, including the requirements and restrictions under our securitized financing facility and other debt agreements.A substantial amount of our common stock is concentrated in the hands of certain stockholders.Nelson Peltz, our Chairman, Peter May, our Senior Vice Chairman and Matthew Peltz, our Vice Chairman, beneficially own shares of our outstanding common stock that collectively constitute approximately 16% of the Company’s total voting power as of February 16, 2024.  These individuals may, from time to time, acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of common stock.On December 1, 2011, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Trian Agreement”) with Messrs. N. Peltz and May and several of their affiliates (the “Covered Persons”).  Pursuant to the Trian Agreement, our Board of Directors, including a majority of the independent directors, approved, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Covered Persons becoming the owners (as defined in Section 203(c)(9)) of or acquiring an aggregate of up to (and including), 26but not more than, 32.5% (subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Trian Agreement) of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, such that no such persons would be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 203 solely as a result of such ownership.  This concentration of ownership gives these individuals significant influence over the outcome of actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets.  They are also in a position to have significant influence to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.Our certificate of incorporation contains certain anti-takeover provisions and permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and limits our ability to raise capital from affiliates.Certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation are intended to discourage or delay a hostile takeover of control of the Company.  Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of “blank check” preferred stock, which will have such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors.  Accordingly, our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of our common stock.  The preferred stock could be used to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that is determined by the Board of Directors to be undesirable.  Our certificate of incorporation prohibits the issuance of preferred stock to affiliates, unless offered ratably to the holders of our common stock, subject to an exception in the event that the Company is in financial distress and the issuance is approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.  This prohibition limits our ability to raise capital from affiliates.General Business RisksComplaints or litigation could hurt our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.Wendy’s customers may file complaints or lawsuits against us or our franchisees alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to a Wendy’s restaurant, or alleging that there was a problem with food safety, food quality or operations at a Wendy’s restaurant.  We may also be subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims from franchisees, intellectual property claims, stockholder claims, data privacy claims and claims alleging violations of law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, including class action lawsuits.  Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management’s attention away from operations, hurt our performance and have a negative impact on our brand.  While we believe we have adequate accruals for all of our legal and environmental matters, we cannot estimate the aggregate possible range of loss for our existing litigation and claims due to various reasons, including, but not limited to, many proceedings being in preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur, and significant factual matters unresolved.  In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties.  Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions are thus inherently difficult.  Insurance policies contain customary limitations, conditions and exclusions that can affect the amount of insurance proceeds ultimately received.  A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.  Additionally, the restaurant industry has been subject to a number of claims alleging that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have contributed to the obesity or otherwise adversely impacted the health of certain of their customers.  Adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may harm the reputation of our restaurants, even if the allegations are not directed against our restaurants or are not valid.  Moreover, complaints, litigation or adverse publicity experienced by one or more of our franchisees could also hurt our brand or business as a whole.Existing and changing legal and regulatory requirements, as well as an increasing focus on environmental, social and governance issues, could adversely affect our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.Our complex legal and regulatory environment exposes us to compliance, litigation and similar risks that could affect our operations and results in material ways.  Each Wendy’s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, safety and other agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located, as well as to federal laws, rules and regulations and requirements of non-governmental entities such as payment card industry rules.  Governmental authorities may enact laws, rules or regulations that impact restaurant operations and the cost of conducting those operations, including, among other matters, product packaging, marketing, the nutritional content and safety of our food and other products, labeling and other disclosure practices.  In addition, there can be no assurance that we and our franchisees will not experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for opening new restaurants.  More stringent and varied 27requirements of local regulators with respect to tax, zoning, land use and environmental factors could also delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.We are subject to various laws and regulations that govern the offer and sale of a franchise, including rules by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  Various state, provincial and foreign laws regulate certain aspects of the franchise relationship, including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises.  The failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales, fines and penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  We could also face lawsuits by franchisees based upon alleged violations of these laws.  We and our franchisees are each also subject to laws and regulations that govern employment matters at the federal/national, state/provincial and local levels.  In the United States, this includes laws like the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, Title VII, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the National Labor Relations Act, family leave, paid sick time and similar requirements and a variety of other laws, regulations and rules.  Changes in laws, regulations, rules and governmental policies, including the interpretation thereof, could increase our costs, require modifications to our business practices, result in increased litigation, investigations, enforcement actions, fines or liabilities and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Changes in the legal framework of employment or franchise liability could negatively impact our business, particularly if such changes result in any law, rule, regulation, governmental policy or interpretation or judicial decision determining that Wendy’s is an employer of its franchisees or a joint employer with our franchisees or otherwise imposing liability for employment-related claims or impacting our employment relationships based on theories of joint employer liability or other theories of vicarious liability.  In addition, various state and local laws may require wage increases and impose working hour and working condition standards that could result in increased costs, limit our or our franchisees’ ability to respond to market conditions and negatively impact our ability to identify, attract and retain qualified franchisees to operate or open restaurants in the impacted markets.  If we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with this complex legislative and regulatory environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.We are also subject to legal and compliance risks related to privacy and data collection, protection and management of certain data and information associated with our technology-related services and platforms made available to customers, employees, franchisees, business partners or other third parties.  We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations in this area.  These laws and regulations have been subject to frequent change, and there may be jurisdictions that propose or enact new data privacy requirements in the future.  Failure to meet applicable data privacy requirements could result in legal proceedings and substantial penalties and adversely impact our business and financial condition.  Additionally, evolving laws and regulations could require us and our franchisees to change or limit the way we collect or use information in operating our business, which may result in additional costs, limit our marketing or growth strategies and adversely affect our business and results of operations. There has been increasing public focus by investors, activists, the media and governmental and nongovernmental organizations on environmental, social and governance matters, including packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, human rights, diversity, climate change, greenhouse gases and land, energy and water use.  As a result, we have experienced increased pressure and expectations to provide expanded disclosure and establish commitments, goals or targets with respect to various environmental, social and governance issues and to take the actions necessary to meet those commitments, goals and targets.  Furthermore, the standards by which certain environmental, social and governance issues are measured are evolving and subject to frequent change.  If we are not effective, or perceived to be effective, in meeting our commitments, goals or targets or otherwise addressing various environmental, social and governance matters, this could result in negative publicity, decreased consumer trust in our brand or litigation.  In addition, the actions needed to meet our commitments, goals and targets could result in market, operational, execution and other costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.  Our results of operation and financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to effectively manage the risks or costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain associated with environmental, social and governance matters.Our current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims that have been or may be filed.We currently maintain insurance that we believe to be adequate for businesses of our size and type.  However, there are types of losses we could encounter that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters, acts of terrorism or the declaration of war.  In addition, we currently self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under workers’ compensation, general liability, products liability, auto liability and property insurance programs.  Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense, which could harm our business and adversely 28affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We also currently maintain insurance coverage to address cyber incidents.  Applicable insurance policies contain customary limitations, conditions and exclusions, and there can be no assurance that our cyber or other insurance policies will cover substantially all of the costs and expenses related to any previous or future incidents.  In addition, our future insurance premiums may increase, and we may be unable to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms, or at all, due to challenging conditions in the insurance industry.  Any inadequacy of, or inability to obtain, insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.Changes in accounting standards, or the recognition of impairment or other charges, could adversely affect our future results of operations. New accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, could adversely affect our future results.  We may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our earnings.  In assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets, we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors.  These estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, consumer and demographic trends and restructuring activities.  If our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, or if the operating performance or cash flows of our business decline, we may be required to record impairment charges, which could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results for the affected periods.Tax matters, including changes in tax rates or laws, imposition of new taxes, disagreements with taxing authorities and unanticipated tax liabilities, could impact our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax matters and initiatives around the world.  In particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax rates, laws or policies or related authoritative interpretations.  We are also impacted by the settlement of adjustments proposed by taxing and governmental authorities in connection with our tax reviews and audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope.  While we believe our recorded provision for income taxes properly reflects all applicable tax laws as currently enacted, there can be no assurance that we would be successful in challenging adjustments by the relevant tax authorities.  Any significant increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Our operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.Most of our revenues, costs and indebtedness is denominated in U.S. dollars, which is also our reporting currency.  Our international operations that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated to U.S. dollars for our financial reporting purposes and are impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in currency regulations.  Our exposures to foreign currency risk are primarily related to fluctuations in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar for our Canadian operations.  Unfavorable currency fluctuations could reduce our royalty income and revenues.  While we attempt to minimize our foreign currency risks, our risk management strategies may not be effective and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.Our results can be adversely affected by unforeseen events, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities, social unrest, health epidemics or pandemics or other catastrophic events.Unforeseen events, such as adverse weather conditions (including related to climate change), natural disasters, hostilities (including acts of war, terrorist activities and public or workplace violence), social unrest, health epidemics or pandemics or other catastrophic events can adversely affect consumer spending, consumer confidence, restaurant sales and operations, supply chains and our ability to perform corporate or support functions at our restaurant support center, any of which could affect our business, results of operations and financial condition"
15,WEN,WENDY'S CO,2023-03-01,"Risk Factors
.We wish to caution readers that in addition to the important factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we have included below certain material factors that have affected, or in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results during fiscal 2023, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.Risks Related to Macroeconomic and Industry ConditionsCompetition from other restaurant companies, as well as grocery chains and other retail food outlets, or poor customer experience at Wendy’s restaurants, could hurt our brand.The market segments in which Wendy’s restaurants compete are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, price, food quality and presentation, service, location, convenience and the nature and condition of the restaurant facility.  If customers have a poor experience at a Wendy’s restaurant, whether at a Company-operated or franchised restaurant, we may experience a decrease in customer counts.  Further, Wendy’s restaurants compete with a variety of locally owned restaurants, as well as competitive regional, national and global restaurant chains.  Several of these chains compete by offering menu items that are targeted at certain consumer groups or dietary trends.  Additionally, many of our competitors have introduced lower cost value meal menu options and have employed marketing strategies that include frequent use of price discounting (including through the use of coupons and other offers), frequent promotions and heavy advertising expenditures.  Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing and marketing strategies better than we can and drive higher levels of brand awareness among consumers.  This product and price competition could result in reduced revenues and loss of market share.Moreover, new companies, including operators outside the quick-service restaurant industry, may enter market areas in which Wendy’s restaurants operate and target our customer base.  For example, additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases have come from deli sections and in-store cafes of a number of major grocery store chains, as well as from convenience stores, casual dining outlets and food delivery providers.  Such competitors may have, among other things, lower operating costs, better locations, better facilities, more effective marketing and more efficient operations.  Wendy’s also competes with grocery chains and other retail outlets or concepts that sell food to be prepared at home.  Competition with these chains and other outlets could increase based on the gap between the price of food prepared at home compared to the price of food purchased at restaurants.  This increased product and price competition could put deflationary pressure on the selling price of products offered at Wendy’s restaurants.  All such competition may adversely affect our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.Adverse economic conditions or disruptions in the national and global economies, or in regions that have a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants, could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.Adverse economic conditions or disruptions in the national and global economies could result in higher unemployment rates, labor shortages, increases in inflation and interest rates and declines in consumer confidence and spending.  If such disruptions occur, they may result in significant declines in consumer food-away-from-home spending and customer counts in Wendy’s restaurants.  There can be no assurance that government responses to economic disruptions will restore consumer confidence.  Ongoing disruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Additionally, adverse economic conditions in regions that contain a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants, including markets in which Company-operated restaurants are located, could also have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.Changes in discretionary consumer spending, and in consumer tastes and preferences, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The success of the Wendy’s system depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income.  Material declines in the amount of discretionary spending or consumer food-away-from-home spending could hurt our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Furthermore, significant increases in expenses incurred by consumers, such as living expenses or gasoline prices, could also adversely affect our business.  Our success also depends to a large extent on continued consumer acceptance of our offerings, the success of our operating, promotional, marketing and new product development initiatives and the reputation of our brand.  If we are unable to continue to achieve consumer acceptance or adapt to changes in consumer preferences, including 16with respect to nutrition, health or dietary trends or environmental or social concerns, Wendy’s restaurants may lose customers, and the resulting revenues from Company-operated restaurants and the royalties that we receive from franchisees may decline.The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and could continue to disrupt our business, which has materially affected and could continue to materially affect our results of operations, financial condition and prospects.The COVID-19 pandemic and related protective measures have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our business.  During the height of the pandemic, our customer counts and systemwide sales were significantly negatively impacted.  Even as mobility increases, customers have been and may continue to be reluctant to return to in-restaurant dining.  Our restaurant operations have been and could continue to be disrupted by the pandemic, including restaurant and dining room closures, labor shortages or increased labor costs.  Furthermore, the pandemic has led, and could again lead, to interruptions in the delivery of food or other supplies to Wendy’s restaurants arising from delays or restrictions on shipping or manufacturing, labor shortages and increased labor costs, closures of supplier or distributor facilities or financial distress of suppliers or distributors.  These delays or interruptions have impacted, and could continue to impact, the availability of certain food items at Wendy’s restaurants, including beef, chicken, pork and other core menu products.  Our results of operations and those of our franchisees could be adversely affected if our key suppliers or distributors are unable to fulfill their responsibilities and we are unable to timely identify and transition the impacted business to alternative suppliers or distributors.  The pandemic has had, and could again have, an adverse effect on new restaurant development, as well as on our franchisees’ operations and financial condition.  To the extent the pandemic causes development delays, or leads to the financial distress of our franchisees, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be impacted.  Such risks and other potential impacts from the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources, which may impede our ability to comply with our debt covenants or access additional capital.  In addition to the risks described above, the pandemic has had, and could continue to have, the effect of heightening other risks disclosed in this risk factors section, including, but not limited to, those related to brand value and perception, consumer preferences and spending, our ability to achieve or maintain market share, new restaurant development, commodity costs, labor, supply chain and purchasing and international operations.  We cannot predict the ultimate duration, scope or severity of the pandemic or its ultimate impact on our results of operations, financial condition and prospects.Risks Related to Brand Perception and ValueOur success depends substantially on our corporate reputation and on the value and perception of our brand.Our success depends in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brand, our customers’ loyalty to our brand and a positive relationship with our franchisees and other business partners.  Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities.  Business incidents, whether isolated or recurring, and whether originating from us, our franchisees or our business partners, can significantly reduce brand value and consumer trust, particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation.  For example, our brand could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality or safety of our products or the quality or reputation of our franchisees or other business partners, regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are true.  Our brand could also be adversely impacted by other incidents described in this risk factors section, including incidents related to customer service, health or safety, a failure to attract and retain qualified employees, food safety or other health concerns regarding our products, the impact of social media, data privacy violations, cyber incidents, environmental, social and governance matters or reports of our employees, franchisees or business partners taking controversial positions or acting in an unethical, illegal or socially irresponsible manner.  Any such incidents could cause a decline in consumer confidence in our brand and reduce consumer demand for our products, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our results of operations and the value and perception of our brand depend in part on the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs and the successful development and launch of new products.Our results of operations and the value and perception of our brand are heavily influenced by brand marketing and advertising and by our ability to develop and launch new and innovative products.  Our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful, or we may fail to develop commercially successful new products, which may impact our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and the value and perception of our brand.  Moreover, because franchisees contribute to advertising funds based on a percentage of sales at their franchised restaurants, advertising fund expenditures are dependent upon sales volumes across the Wendy’s system.  If systemwide sales decline, this could result in a reduced amount of funds available for our marketing and advertising programs.  In addition, to the extent we use value offerings or other promotions or discounts in our marketing and advertising 17programs to drive customer counts, these actions may condition our customers to resist higher menu prices or result in reduced demand for premium products.Our inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could adversely impact our brand, business and results of operations.Social media platforms, including forms of internet-based communications, allow individuals access to a broad audience.  The availability of information on social media platforms is virtually immediate and has given users the ability to more effectively organize collective actions such as boycotts and other brand-damaging behaviors.  The dissemination of information via social media, whether accurate or inaccurate, could harm our business, brand, reputation, results of operation and financial condition.  This damage may be immediate, without an opportunity to correct inaccurate information or respond to or address particular issues.  In addition, as part of our marketing efforts, we frequently use social media to communicate with consumers in order to build their awareness of, engagement with and loyalty to our brand.  Our failure to use social media effectively or appropriately, particularly as compared to our competitors, could lead to a decline in brand value, customer visits and revenues.   Laws and regulations governing the use of social media continue to rapidly evolve.  A failure by us, our employees, our franchisees or third parties acting on our behalf to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of social media could adversely impact our reputation, brand, results of operations and financial condition or subject us to litigation, fines or other penalties.  Social media risks could also arise from employees not following defined policies for the use of social media during business operations, or actions taken by employees during personal activities outside of their employment, but which could still reflect negatively on the Wendy’s brand.We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and hurt our business.Our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business.  We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and other intellectual property.  The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our continued ability to use our trademarks and service marks to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in existing and new markets.  If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, or if any third party misappropriates, infringes, dilutes or otherwise violates our intellectual property, the value of our brand may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  While we try to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by our franchisees, we cannot ensure that franchisees will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property or the reputation of the Wendy’s brand or restaurant system.  Any damage or violation of our intellectual property could harm our image, brand or competitive position and result in significant legal fees and the diversion of resources.  If we do not attempt or are unable to successfully protect, maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights, there could be a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations as a result of, among other things, consumer confusion, dilution of the Wendy’s brand or increased competition from unauthorized users of our brand.We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions.  Not all of the trademarks that are used in the Wendy’s system have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business or may do business in the future, and some trademarks will never be registered in all of these countries.  Some countries’ laws make unregistered trademarks more difficult to enforce, or do not protect them at all, and third parties have filed, or may in the future file, for “Wendy’s” or similar marks.  Accordingly, we may not be able to adequately protect the Wendy’s brand everywhere in the world and use of the Wendy’s brand may result in liability for trademark infringement, trademark dilution or unfair competition.  In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.  We cannot ensure that all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate.We cannot ensure that third parties will not bring infringement claims against us in the future.  Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, cause delays in introducing new menu items, require costly modifications to advertising and promotional materials, harm our brand, image, competitive position or ability to expand our operations into other jurisdictions, cause us to incur significant costs related to defense or settlement or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.  As a result, any such claim could harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, third parties may assert that certain of our intellectual property, or our rights therein, are invalid or unenforceable.  If our rights in any of our intellectual property were found to infringe third-party rights, or portions thereof were deemed invalid or unenforceable, we may be forced to defend or resolve related claims and incur related expenses.  In addition, such loss of rights could permit competing uses of such intellectual property which, in turn, could harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.18Food safety events or health concerns regarding our products could create negative publicity and adversely affect our brand, business and results of operations.Food safety is a top priority for Wendy’s, and we dedicate substantial resources to food safety matters to ensure our customers enjoy safe, quality food products.  However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. coli), have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future.  For example, in August 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”) began investigating a multistate outbreak of E. coli in which many of the impacted individuals reported having eaten at a Wendy’s restaurant and most reported consuming sandwich romaine lettuce.  The Company cooperated with the CDC’s investigation and, as a precautionary measure, removed sandwich romaine lettuce from its restaurants in the relevant region.  In October 2022, the CDC announced that the outbreak was over and that the specific source of the outbreak had not been confirmed.  The Company was referenced in news stories related to the outbreak, and the Company (and others) have been named in various claims and lawsuits related to the outbreak.  Food safety events, whether or not involving Wendy’s restaurants or other restaurant companies, could adversely affect the price and availability of certain products and result in negative publicity for Wendy’s or the restaurant industry.  This negative publicity may reduce demand for Wendy’s food and could result in a decrease in customer counts to Wendy’s restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types.  Any report linking our restaurants or suppliers to food-borne illnesses, food tampering, contamination or mislabeling or other food-safety issues could damage the value of our brand immediately and severely hurt sales of our products and possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) or other damages.  The Wendy’s system may also be adversely impacted by consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of the products we sell, the ingredients in our products or the cooking processes used in our restaurants.  These or similar concerns could result in less demand for our products and a decline in sales at Company-operated restaurants and in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.Risks Related to Our Business StrategyWe may be unable to deliver accelerated global sales growth or achieve or maintain market share across our dayparts.Our business strategy includes a focus on driving strong sales momentum across all of our dayparts through exciting menu innovation, compelling value offerings and operational excellence.  However, we may be unable to deliver accelerated global sales growth or achieve or maintain market share across our dayparts due to competitive pressures and other factors, such as consumer tastes and preferences, the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs, the successful development and launch of new products, commodity and labor costs, providing fast and accurate customer experiences, further accelerating our digital business, driving new restaurant development and ensuring the support and engagement of franchisees.  For example, Wendy’s recently entered the breakfast daypart in the United States and Canada with a breakfast program designed to drive incremental sales and profits through a strong economic model.  Our inability to successfully execute on our strategy for the breakfast daypart and reach targeted levels of sales and profits could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our predominantly franchised business model presents a number of risks.As of January 1, 2023, approximately 95% of restaurants in the Wendy’s system were operated by franchisees.  Wendy’s franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with the standards set forth in our franchise and other agreements with them.  Wendy’s also provides training and support to franchisees.  However, franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants.  Specifically, franchisees are solely responsible for developing and utilizing their own policies and procedures, making their own hiring, firing and disciplinary decisions, scheduling hours and establishing wages and managing their day-to-day employment processes and procedures in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, all of which is done independent of Wendy’s.  Further, franchisees have discretion as to the prices charged to customers.  As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee.  If franchisees do not successfully operate their restaurants in a manner consistent with required standards, their royalty payments to us could be adversely affected and our brand’s image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn, could hurt our business and results of operations.  In addition, the failure of franchisees to adequately engage in succession planning may adversely affect their restaurant operations and development of new Wendy’s restaurants, which in turn could hurt our business and results of operations.Wendy’s franchisees are an integral part of our business, growth and brand strategies, and difficulties in identifying, attracting and retaining franchisees who meet our criteria could harm our business and brand.  Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if a significant number of franchisees do not participate in brand strategies, such as new restaurant development, Image Activation, marketing and menu programs and digital commerce platforms and technologies, 19which in turn may harm our business and financial condition.  In addition, Wendy’s current franchise model, and the way our brand strategies are executed across the system, may make it difficult for our brand to respond and adapt to the speed of change in technology, consumer preferences or other factors as quickly as may be required to maintain and grow market share and remain competitive.  Certain of our competitors that have a significantly higher percentage of company-operated restaurants than we do may have greater influence over their respective restaurant systems and greater ability to implement operational initiatives and business strategies.We receive revenues in the form of royalties and national advertising funds contributions (both of which are generally based on a percentage of sales at franchised restaurants), as well as rent and fees from franchisees.  Accordingly, a substantial portion of our financial results is to a large extent dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees.  If sales trends or economic conditions worsen for franchisees, or if the overall business or financial health of franchisees deteriorates, their results of operations or financial condition may worsen and our royalty, national advertising funds, rent and other fee revenues may decline.  Additionally, when Company-operated restaurants with leased real estate are sold to franchisees, we are often required to remain responsible for lease payments for these restaurants in the event the purchasing franchisees default on their leases.  Similarly, when we lease or sublease properties to franchisees, we remain responsible for certain expenses related to the properties, such as lease payments and maintenance charges.  If franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements or fail to perform under or extend their leases or subleases with us, or if we are unable to identify, attract and retain new franchisees who meet our criteria, then our royalty and rental revenues may decrease and our future growth could be adversely affected.The growth of our business is dependent on new restaurant openings, which could be affected by factors beyond our control.Our business derives earnings from sales at Company-operated restaurants as well as royalties and other fees received from franchised restaurants.  Growth in our revenues and earnings is dependent on new restaurant openings.  Numerous factors beyond our control may adversely affect new restaurant openings, which in turn could hurt our business and results of operations.  These factors include, among others: (i) our ability to attract new franchisees; (ii) the availability of site locations for new restaurants; (iii) the ability of restaurant owners to obtain financing; (iv) the ability of restaurant owners to attract, train and retain qualified operating personnel; (v) construction and development costs; (vi) the ability of restaurant owners to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all; (vii) the ability of us and our franchises to execute our development strategy for non-traditional restaurants, such as fuel and transportation centers, food courts and other retail locations, military bases and delivery kitchens; and (viii) adverse weather conditions.  Our inability to identify suitable locations, achieve consumer acceptance or otherwise execute our development strategy could have an adverse impact on our future growth, results of operations and financial condition.Our Image Activation program may not positively affect sales or improve our results of operations, and franchisees may not participate in our Image Activation program to the extent expected by us.We continue to implement our Image Activation program, which includes reimaging existing Wendy’s restaurants and building new Wendy’s restaurants with innovative exterior and interior restaurant designs.  Our Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at Wendy’s restaurants or improve our results of operations.  There can also be no assurance that franchisees will participate in the Image Activation program to the extent expected by the Company.  In order to support our Image Activation program and promote new restaurant development, we have provided franchisees with certain incentive programs for qualifying new and reimaged restaurants, including waivers or reductions in royalty, national advertising and technical assistance fees and options for the early renewal of franchise agreements.  It is possible we may provide additional financial incentives to franchisees, which could result in additional expenses, a reduction of royalties or other revenues or the incurrence of other costs or liabilities.  Some franchisees may need to borrow funds in order to reimage existing restaurants or build new restaurants under the Image Activation program.  If franchisees are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, they may be unwilling or unable to invest in the reimaging of their existing restaurants or the development of new restaurants, and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.We may be unable to manage effectively the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, or successfully implement other strategic initiatives, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results.We continue to optimize the Wendy’s system through our system optimization initiative, which includes facilitating the transfer of restaurants between and among franchisees, as well as evaluating strategic acquisitions of franchised restaurants and strategic dispositions of Company-operated restaurants to existing and new franchisees, to further strengthen the franchisee base, drive new restaurant development and accelerate adoption of our Image Activation program.  The success of this initiative 20is dependent upon many factors, such as the availability of sellers and buyers, the availability of financing, the ability to negotiate transactions on terms deemed acceptable and the ability to successfully transition and integrate restaurant operations.  Acquisitions of franchised restaurants pose various risks to our operations, including (i) diversion of management’s attention to the integration of acquired restaurant operations; (ii) increased operating expenses and the inability to achieve expected cost savings and operating efficiencies; (iii) exposure to liabilities arising out of prior operations of acquired restaurants; and (iv) the assumption of long-term, non-cancelable leases.  Our system optimization initiative also places demands on our operational and financial management resources and may require us to expand these resources.  If we are unable to execute our system optimization initiative or effectively manage the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.In addition, Wendy’s from time to time evaluates and may pursue other opportunities for growth, including through new and existing franchise partners, joint venture investments, expansion of our brand through other opportunities and strategic mergers, acquisitions and divestitures.  These strategic initiatives involve various risks, including general transaction and business risk, integration and synergy risk, market acceptance risk and risks associated with the potential diversion of management’s attention.  Strategic transactions may not ultimately create value for us or our stockholders and may harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our leasing and ownership of significant amounts of real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses, including liabilities associated with environmental matters.We have significant real estate operations in connection with our business and are subject to the normal risks associated with owning, leasing and subleasing real estate.  Our real estate values and the costs associated with our real estate operations are impacted by a variety of factors, including changes in the investment climate for real estate, macroeconomic trends, governmental regulations, infrastructure, condemnation or eminent domain, insurance, demographic trends, supply chain management, supply and demand for the ownership and operation of restaurants and environmental matters.  A significant decrease in real estate values or increase in real estate costs could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances.  These environmental laws provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner, operator or occupant of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances.  Third parties may also make claims against owners, operators or occupants of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of or exposure to such substances.  A number of our restaurant sites were formerly gas stations or are adjacent to current or former gas stations or were used for other commercial activities that can create environmental impacts.  While we employ environmental review standards and practices in the current development of our real estate, we have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of all of our properties and we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our leased and owned properties, and any such liabilities identified in the future could cause us to incur significant costs, including costs associated with litigation, fines or clean-up responsibilities.  We cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with any environmental laws or regulations or to satisfy any such claims.We generally secure long-term real estate interests for our leased restaurants and have limited flexibility to quickly alter our real estate portfolio.  Many leases provide that the rent will increase over the term of the lease and any renewals of the term.  Most leases require us to pay the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance, utilities and capital repairs and replacements.  We generally cannot cancel these leases prior to the expiration of their term.  If an existing or future restaurant is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying rent, taxes and maintenance costs for the balance of the lease term.  In addition, as our leases expire, we may fail to negotiate additional renewals or renewal options, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close restaurants in desirable locations, negatively impacting our results of operations.Our international operations are subject to various risks and uncertainties and there is no assurance that our international operations will continue to be profitable.In addition to many of the factors described in this risk factors section, our business outside of the United States is subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including international economic and political conditions, risk of corruption and violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws of other countries, the inability to adapt to differing cultures or consumer preferences, inadequate brand infrastructure to support our international activities, inability to obtain adequate supplies meeting our quality standards and product specifications or interruptions in obtaining such supplies, 21challenges and risks associated with managing and monitoring suppliers, restrictions on our ability to move cash out of certain foreign countries, currency regulations and fluctuations, diverse government regulations and tax systems, uncertain or differing interpretations of rights and obligations in connection with international franchise agreements, the collection of royalties and other fees from international franchisees, the inability to protect technology, data or intellectual property rights, compliance with international privacy and information security laws and regulations, the availability and cost of land, construction costs, other legal, financial or regulatory impediments to the development or operation of restaurants, the inability to identify, attract and retain experienced management, qualified franchisees and joint venture partners and ongoing disruptions and impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Adverse conditions or unforeseen events in countries that contain a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants (including Canada, our largest international market), could have a material adverse impact on our international growth strategy and results of operations.  In addition, to the extent we invest in international Company-operated restaurants or joint ventures, we would also have the risk of operating losses related to those restaurants, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  There can be no assurance that our international growth strategy will be successful or that our international operations will be profitable.For example, Wendy’s entered the United Kingdom in 2021, plans to expand into other anchor markets in Europe utilizing a franchise model and intends to accelerate restaurant development in other existing international markets.  New and emerging markets may have lower brand awareness as well as competitive conditions, consumer tastes and preferences, discretionary spending patterns and social and cultural differences that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets.  We may need to make greater investments than we originally planned in advertising and promotional activity to build brand awareness, which could negatively impact the profitability of our operations.  In addition, we may be unable to obtain desirable locations for new restaurants at reasonable prices, or at all, and restaurants may have higher construction, occupancy, food and labor costs than we currently anticipate.  Any of these risks and uncertainties, and other factors we cannot anticipate, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Risks Related to Supply Chain and LaborChanges in commodity costs and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations.Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken, pork, dairy and grains), supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs, including labor costs.  Increases in commodity costs have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our results of operations.  Our business is susceptible to increases in commodity and other operating costs as a result of various factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, inflation, industry demand, energy costs, food safety concerns, animal disease outbreaks, product recalls   and government regulations.  Increasing weather volatility or other long-term changes in weather patterns, including related to climate change, could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of our ingredients.  In addition, our supply chain is subject to increased costs arising from actual or perceived effects of climate change, greenhouse gas emissions and scarcity of energy and water resources.  The ongoing and long-term costs of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business if not properly mitigated.  We could also be adversely impacted by the cost of products raised or grown in accordance with our responsible sourcing criteria, including those related to environmental sustainability and animal welfare, as the availability of products that can be assured to meet those criteria are generally smaller and more concentrated, and may be more costly, than the markets for conventionally raised or grown products that are not assured to meet those criteria.  We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing commodity costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our results of operations.  In addition, we may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to our customers.  If increased costs were passed to our customers, demand for our products may decrease, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations.Shortages or interruptions in the supply or distribution of perishable food products could damage our brand and adversely affect our business and results of operations.Wendy’s and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet brand specifications.  Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, labor shortages, disease or food-borne illnesses, political unrest, health epidemics or pandemics, inclement weather or other calamities or conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which could lower revenues, increase operating costs, damage brand reputation and otherwise harm our business and the businesses of our franchisees.  Certain of the products sold in our restaurants, such as beef and chicken, are sourced from a limited number of suppliers, which may increase our reliance on those suppliers.  In addition, our system relies on a limited number of in-line distributors to deliver certain food, packaging and beverage products to our restaurants.  If a disruption of service from any of our key suppliers or distributors was to occur, we could experience short-term increases in our costs while 22supply and distribution channels were adjusted, and we may be unable to identify or negotiate with new suppliers or distributors on terms that are commercially reasonable to us.We do not exercise ultimate control over purchasing for our restaurant system, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.While we require and seek to ensure that all suppliers to the Wendy’s system meet certain quality control standards, our franchisees ultimately control the purchasing of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies from third party suppliers through QSCC, Wendy’s independent purchasing co-op.  QSCC manages, for the Wendy’s system in the United States and Canada, contracts for the purchase and distribution of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies under national agreements with pricing based on total system volume.  We do not control the decisions and activities of QSCC.  If QSCC does not properly estimate the product needs of the Wendy’s system, makes poor purchasing decisions or ceases its operations, or if our relationship with QSCC is terminated for any reason, system sales, operating costs and supply chain management could be adversely affected, which could harm us and our franchisees and have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our business could be hurt by increased labor costs or labor shortages.Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our restaurants.  We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our restaurant personnel, including managers and hourly employees.  Increased labor costs due to competition, inflationary pressures, increased wages or employee benefits costs (including various federal, state and local actions to increase minimum wages), unionization activity or other factors have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our cost of sales and operating expenses.  In addition, Wendy’s success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and staff as well as employees and key personnel at our restaurant support center, and our inability to do so could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  Our business, results of operations and brand perception could also be adversely impacted by unionization efforts or other campaigns by labor organizations affecting our employees or the employees of our franchisees or by our responses to any such efforts or campaigns.Our success depends in part upon the continued succession and retention of certain key personnel and the effectiveness of our leadership and organizational structure.We believe that over time our success has been dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior leadership team and other key personnel.  Our failure to retain members of our senior leadership team or other key personnel could adversely affect our ability to achieve our growth strategy and other business initiatives.  In addition, changes to our leadership and organizational structure can be inherently difficult to manage, and if we are unable to implement such changes effectively, our business, results of operations and financial results could be adversely affected.Risks Related to Technology and CybersecurityThere are risks and uncertainties associated with our increasing dependence on digital commerce platforms and technologies and alternative methods of delivery.Advances in technologies, including advances in digital food ordering and delivery technologies, and changes in consumer behavior driven by such advances could have a negative effect on our business.  Technology and consumer offerings continue to develop and evolve, and we expect that new and enhanced technologies and consumer offerings will be available in the future, including those with a focus on restaurant modernization, restaurant technology, digital engagement and integration, online ordering and delivery.  Our inability to predict consumer acceptance of new technology or our failure to adequately invest in and implement new technology or adapt to technological developments, industry trends and evolving legal and regulatory requirements could result in a loss of customers and related market share.  In addition, our competitors, some of whom have greater resources than we do, may be better able to benefit from changes in technologies or consumer acceptance of such changes, which could harm our competitive position and brand.An increasing amount of our sales and revenues is derived from digital orders, which includes online ordering and delivery.  We have implemented technology and targeted advertising and promotions to support the growth of our digital business.  If we are unable to continue to grow our digital business, it may be difficult for us to achieve our planned sales growth.  If our digital commerce platforms, including the Wendy’s mobile app and online ordering system, do not meet customers’ expectations in terms of security, privacy, speed, attractiveness or ease of use, customers may be less inclined to return to those platforms, 23which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our business could also be negatively impacted if we are unable to successfully implement or execute other consumer-facing digital initiatives, such as mobile order pick-up and carryout.  We rely on third-party delivery services to fulfill delivery orders, and errors or failures by those providers to make timely deliveries could cause customers to stop ordering from us.  The third-party restaurant delivery business is intensely competitive, with a number of companies competing for capital, market share, online traffic and delivery drivers.  If the third-party delivery services that we utilize cease or curtail their operations, increase their fees or give greater priority or promotions on their platforms to our competitors, our delivery business and our sales may be negatively impacted.  In addition, the delivery business has been consolidating and may continue to consolidate, which may give third-party delivery companies more leverage in negotiating the terms and pricing of contracts, which could in turn negatively impact our profits from this channel.We are heavily dependent on computer systems and information technology and any material failure, interruption or degradation of our systems or technology or issues with our key technology providers could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are heavily dependent on our computer systems and information technology, including those controlled by third-party providers, to conduct our business, including point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, technologies that support our digital and delivery solutions, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures.  Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and performance of our systems and technology.  The failure of our systems and technology to operate effectively, or an interruption or degradation in our systems or technology could be harmful and cause delays in customer service, result in the loss of digital sales or data, reduce efficiency or cause delays in operations.  Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any such problems or to maintain or upgrade our systems and technology or transition to replacement systems or technology.We are dependent to a significant extent on our ongoing relationship with key technology providers, including their personnel, resources, technological expertise, systems and technology and their ability to help execute our digital, restaurant technology and enterprise technology initiatives and support our technology innovation and growth initiatives.  The inability of us or our providers to successfully execute our technology growth initiatives while maintaining our brand value and perception could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in cybersecurity, could negatively impact our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.Cybersecurity incidents or breaches have, from time to time, occurred and may in the future occur involving our systems, the systems of our franchisees or the systems of third-party service providers.  Such cybersecurity incidents and breaches may include, without limitation, unauthorized access, phishing attacks, account takeovers, denial of service, computer viruses, introduction of malware or ransomware and other disruptive problems caused by malicious actors.  As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our systems, both internal and those managed by third parties.  Our business involves the collection and retention of customer data, including, in some instances, credit and debit card numbers and other personally identifiable information, in various information systems that we and our franchisees maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we and our franchisees contract to provide credit card processing, digital ordering and related services.  We also maintain important internal data, such as personally identifiable information about our employees and franchisees and information relating to our operations.  Our use of personally identifiable information is regulated by international, federal and state laws, as well as by certain third-party agreements.  As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, we will likely incur additional costs to ensure that we remain in compliance with those laws and regulations.  If our security and information systems are compromised or if our employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws, regulations or contract terms, and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect our reputation, disrupt our operations, damage our relationship with customers, franchisees or employees and result in costly litigation, judgments, or penalties resulting from violation of applicable laws and payment card industry regulations.  A cyber incident could also require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity or a loss in consumer confidence, sales and profits, increase fees payable to third parties or cause us to incur penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We have devoted considerable resources to secure our systems and technology against security breaches and have implemented various processes, procedures and controls to help mitigate the risk of a cyber incident.  However, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks change frequently and the measures we have taken do not guarantee that a cyber incident or security breach could not occur or that our business, reputation and financial condition will not be adversely affected.24Risks Related to Our IndebtednessThe Company and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions, and substantially all of the assets of certain subsidiaries are security, under the terms of a securitized financing facility.Wendy’s Funding, LLC, a limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, is the master issuer (the “Master Issuer”) of outstanding senior secured notes under a securitized financing facility entered into in June 2015.  Under the facility, the Master Issuer issued and has outstanding certain series of fixed rate and variable funding notes (collectively, the “Senior Notes”).  The Senior Notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Master Issuer and certain other limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company that act as guarantors (collectively, the “Securitization Entities”), except for certain real estate assets and subject to certain limitations as set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes (the “Indenture”) and the related guarantee and collateral agreement.  The assets of the Securitization Entities include most of the domestic and certain of the foreign revenue-generating assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, which principally consist of franchise-related agreements, real estate assets, intellectual property and license agreements for the use of intellectual property.The Senior Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including that the Master Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Senior Notes, provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments under certain circumstances, certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, that the assets pledged as collateral for the Senior Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective and covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters.  The Senior Notes are also subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service coverage ratios, the sum of global gross sales for specified restaurants being below certain levels on certain measurement dates, certain manager termination events, the occurrence of an event of default and the failure to repay or refinance on the applicable scheduled maturity date.  The Senior Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal or other amounts due on or with respect to the Senior Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, the trustee under the Indenture ceasing to have valid and perfected security interests in certain collateral and certain judgments.  In the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the Indenture (including, without limitation, upon an event of default under the Indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the applicable term), the funds available to the Company would be reduced or eliminated, which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business.In addition, the Indenture and the related management agreement contain various covenants that limit the Company and its subsidiaries’ ability to engage in specified types of transactions, subject to certain exceptions, including, for example, to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, sell certain assets, create or incur liens on certain assets to secure indebtedness or consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets.  As a result of these restrictions, the Company may not have adequate resources or flexibility to continue to manage the business and provide for growth of the Wendy’s system, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future growth prospects, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We have a significant amount of debt outstanding, and such indebtedness could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.As of January 1, 2023, the Company had approximately $2.9 billion of outstanding debt on its balance sheet.  Additionally, a subsidiary of the Company has issued variable funding notes, which allows for the borrowing of up to $300.0 million from time to time on a revolving basis.  This level of debt could have significant consequences on the Company’s future operations, including: (i) making it more difficult to meet payment and other obligations under outstanding debt; (ii) resulting in an event of default if the Company’s subsidiaries fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of the Company’s subsidiaries’ debt becoming immediately due and payable; (iii) reducing the availability of the Company’s cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, equity and debt repurchases, dividends, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; (iv) subjecting the Company to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on indebtedness with variable interest rates; (v) limiting the Company’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to, and increasing its vulnerability to, changes in the Company’s business or industry or the general economy; and (vi) placing the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that are less leveraged.  Further, the Company’s outstanding variable funding notes may accrue interest based on the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”).  In connection with the 25discontinuance of LIBOR, we expect to renegotiate certain loan documents and cannot predict what alternative index will be negotiated with our lenders or the resulting impact on our interest expense.The ability of the Company to make payments on, repay or refinance its debt, and to fund planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend largely upon its future operating performance and ability to generate significant cash flows.  In addition, the ability of the Company to borrow funds in the future to make payments on its debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in the securitized financing facility and other debt agreements, and other agreements it may enter into in the future.  There can be no assurance that the Company’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the Company’s securitized financing facility or other debt agreements or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable the Company to pay its debt or to fund its dividend and other liquidity needs.In addition to the Company’s outstanding indebtedness, the Company is subject to risks related to certain commitments, guarantees and other liabilities.  These commitments, guarantees and other liabilities include, among others, significant contractual requirements regarding the purchase of soft drinks and guarantees and contingent liabilities related to certain franchisee leases for which the Company has been indemnified.  These commitments, guarantees and other liabilities could have an adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity and the ability of its subsidiaries to meet payment obligations.  The Company may incur additional indebtedness, guarantees, commitments or other liabilities in the future that could amplify the risks that the Company currently faces.Risks Related to Our Common StockThere can be no assurance regarding whether or to what extent we will pay dividends on our common stock in the future.Holders of our common stock will only be entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments.  Any dividends will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and such other factors as the Board may deem relevant from time to time.  In addition, because Wendy’s is a holding company, its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent upon cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand and cash flows from its subsidiaries.  The ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to the holding company is dependent upon their ability to achieve sufficient cash flows after satisfying their respective cash requirements, including the requirements and restrictions under our securitized financing facility and other debt agreements.A substantial amount of our common stock is concentrated in the hands of certain stockholders.Nelson Peltz, our Chairman, Peter May, our Senior Vice Chairman, Matthew Peltz, our Vice Chairman, and Edward Garden, a former director of the Company, beneficially own shares of our outstanding common stock that collectively constitute approximately 20% of the Company’s total voting power as of February 21, 2023.  These individuals may, from time to time, acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of common stock.On December 1, 2011, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Trian Agreement”) with Messrs. N. Peltz, May and Garden, and several of their affiliates (the “Covered Persons”).  Pursuant to the Trian Agreement, our Board of Directors, including a majority of the independent directors, approved, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Covered Persons becoming the owners (as defined in Section 203(c)(9)) of or acquiring an aggregate of up to (and including), but not more than, 32.5% (subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Trian Agreement) of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, such that no such persons would be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 203 solely as a result of such ownership.  This concentration of ownership gives these individuals significant influence over the outcome of actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets.  They are also in a position to have significant influence to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.Our certificate of incorporation contains certain anti-takeover provisions and permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and limits our ability to raise capital from affiliates.Certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation are intended to discourage or delay a hostile takeover of control of the Company.  Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of “blank check” preferred stock, which will have such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors.  Accordingly, our 26Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of our common stock.  The preferred stock could be used to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that is determined by the Board of Directors to be undesirable.  Our certificate of incorporation prohibits the issuance of preferred stock to affiliates, unless offered ratably to the holders of our common stock, subject to an exception in the event that the Company is in financial distress and the issuance is approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.  This prohibition limits our ability to raise capital from affiliates.General Business RisksComplaints or litigation could hurt our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.Wendy’s customers may file complaints or lawsuits against us or our franchisees alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to a Wendy’s restaurant, or alleging that there was a problem with food safety, food quality or operations at a Wendy’s restaurant.  We may also be subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims from franchisees, intellectual property claims, data privacy claims and claims alleging violations of law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, including class action lawsuits.  Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management’s attention away from operations, hurt our performance and have a negative impact on our brand.  While we believe we have adequate accruals for all of our legal and environmental matters, we cannot estimate the aggregate possible range of loss for our existing litigation and claims due to various reasons, including, but not limited to, many proceedings being in preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur, and significant factual matters unresolved.  In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties.  Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions are thus inherently difficult.  Insurance policies contain customary limitations, conditions and exclusions that can affect the amount of insurance proceeds ultimately received.  A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.  Additionally, the restaurant industry has been subject to a number of claims alleging that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have contributed to the obesity or otherwise adversely impacted the health of certain of their customers.  Adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may harm the reputation of our restaurants, even if the allegations are not directed against our restaurants or are not valid.  Moreover, complaints, litigation or adverse publicity experienced by one or more of our franchisees could also hurt our brand or business as a whole.Existing and changing legal and regulatory requirements, as well as an increasing focus on environmental, social and governance issues, could adversely affect our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.Each Wendy’s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, safety and other agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located, as well as to federal laws, rules and regulations and requirements of non-governmental entities such as payment card industry rules.  Governmental authorities may enact laws, rules or regulations that impact restaurant operations and the cost of conducting those operations.  In addition, there can be no assurance that we and our franchisees will not experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for opening new restaurants.  More stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to tax, zoning, land use and environmental factors could also delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.We are subject to various laws and regulations that govern the offer and sale of a franchise, including rules by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  Various state, provincial and foreign laws regulate certain aspects of the franchise relationship, including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises.  The failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales, fines and penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  We could also face lawsuits by franchisees based upon alleged violations of these laws.  We and our franchisees are each also subject to laws and regulations that govern employment matters at the federal/national, state/provincial and local levels.  In the United States, this includes laws like the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, Title VII, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the National Labor Relations Act, family leave, paid sick time and similar requirements and a variety of other laws, regulations and rules.  Changes in laws, regulations, rules and governmental policies, including the interpretation thereof, could increase our costs, require modifications to our business practices, result in increased litigation, investigations, enforcement actions, fines or liabilities and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Changes in the legal framework of employment or franchise liability could negatively impact our business, particularly if such 27changes result in any law, rule, regulation, governmental policy or interpretation or judicial decision determining that Wendy’s is an employer of its franchisees or a joint employer with our franchisees or otherwise imposing liability for employment-related claims or impacting our employment relationships based on theories of joint employer liability or other theories of vicarious liability.  In addition, various state and local laws may require wage increases and impose working hour and working condition standards that could result in increased costs, limit our or our franchisees’ ability to respond to market conditions and negatively impact our ability to identify, attract and retain qualified franchisees to operate or open restaurants in the impacted markets.  If we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with this complex legislative and regulatory environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.We are also subject to legal and compliance risks related to privacy and data collection, protection and management of certain data and information associated with our technology-related services and platforms made available to customers, employees, franchisees, business partners or other third parties.  We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations in this area.  These laws and regulations have been subject to frequent change, and there may be jurisdictions that propose or enact new data privacy requirements in the future.  Failure to meet applicable data privacy requirements could result in legal proceedings and substantial penalties and adversely impact our business and financial condition.  Additionally, evolving laws and regulations could require us and our franchisees to change or limit the way we collect or use information in operating our business, which may result in additional costs, limit our marketing or growth strategies and adversely affect our business and results of operations.There has been increasing public focus by investors, environmental activists, the media and governmental and nongovernmental organizations on environmental, social and governance matters, including packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, human rights, diversity, climate change, greenhouse gases and land, energy and water use.  As a result, we have experienced increased pressure and expectations to provide expanded disclosure and establish commitments, goals or targets with respect to various environmental, social and governance issues and to take the actions necessary to meet those commitments, goals and targets.  Furthermore, the standards by which certain environmental, social and governance issues are measured are evolving and subject to frequent change.  If we are not effective, or perceived to be effective, in achieving our commitments, goals or targets or otherwise addressing various environmental, social and governance matters, consumer trust in our brand may suffer.  In addition, the actions needed to achieve our commitments, goals and targets could result in market, operational, execution and other costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.  Our results of operation and financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to effectively manage the risks or costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain associated with environmental, social and governance matters.Our current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims that have been or may be filed.We currently maintain insurance that we believe to be adequate for businesses of our size and type.  However, there are types of losses we could encounter that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters, acts of terrorism or the declaration of war.  In addition, we currently self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under workers’ compensation, general liability, products liability, auto liability and property insurance programs.  Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense, which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We also currently maintain insurance coverage to address cyber incidents.  Applicable insurance policies contain customary limitations, conditions and exclusions, and there can be no assurance that our cyber insurance policies will cover substantially all of the costs and expenses related to any previous or future cyber incidents.  In addition, our future insurance premiums may increase, and we may be unable to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms, or at all, due to challenging conditions in the insurance industry.  Any inadequacy of, or inability to obtain, insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.Changes in accounting standards, or the recognition of impairment or other charges, could adversely affect our future results of operations. New accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, could adversely affect our future results.  We may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our earnings.  In assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets, we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors.  These estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, consumer and demographic trends and restructuring activities.  If our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, or if the operating performance or cash flows of our business decline, we may be 28required to record impairment charges, which could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results for the affected periods.Tax matters, including changes in tax rates or laws, imposition of new taxes, disagreements with taxing authorities and unanticipated tax liabilities, could impact our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax matters and initiatives around the world.  In particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax rates, laws or policies or related authoritative interpretations.  We are also impacted by the settlement of adjustments proposed by taxing and governmental authorities in connection with our tax reviews and audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope.  While we believe our recorded provision for income taxes properly reflects all applicable tax laws as currently enacted, there can be no assurance that we would be successful in challenging adjustments by the relevant tax authorities.  Any significant increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Our operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.Most of our revenues, costs and indebtedness is denominated in U.S. dollars, which is also our reporting currency.  Our international operations that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated to U.S. dollars for our financial reporting purposes and are impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in currency regulations.  Our exposures to foreign currency risk are primarily related to fluctuations in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar for our Canadian operations.  Unfavorable currency fluctuations could reduce our royalty income and revenues.  While we attempt to minimize our foreign currency risks, our risk management strategies may not be effective and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.Our results can be adversely affected by unforeseen events, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities, social unrest, health epidemics or pandemics or other catastrophic events.Unforeseen events, such as adverse weather conditions (including related to climate change), natural disasters, hostilities (including acts of war, terrorist activities and public or workplace violence), social unrest, health epidemics or pandemics or other catastrophic events can adversely affect consumer spending, consumer confidence, restaurant sales and operations, supply chains and our ability to perform corporate or support functions at our restaurant support center, any of which could affect our business, results of operations and financial condition"
10,WEN,WENDY'S CO,2022-03-01,"Risk Factors
.We wish to caution readers that in addition to the important factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we have included below certain material factors that have affected, or in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results during fiscal 2022, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.Risks Related to Macroeconomic and Industry ConditionsThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt our business, which has materially affected and could continue to materially affect our results of operations, financial condition and prospects for an extended period of time.In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic, and governmental authorities around the world implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19.  These measures adversely affected customers, workforces, economies and financial markets, and, along with decreased consumer spending, led to an economic downturn in many of our markets.  Governmental restrictions and public perceptions of the risks associated with COVID-19 have caused consumers to avoid or limit travel, gatherings in public places and other social interactions, which has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our business.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, we updated our brand standard to include the closure of all dining rooms except where there were specific needs, or a drive-thru or pick-up window option was not available, subject to applicable federal, state and local requirements.  Substantially all Wendy’s restaurants continued to offer drive-thru and delivery service to our customers.  During the second quarter of 2020, we began implementing our restaurant and dining room reopening process through a phased approach in accordance with federal, state and local requirements, with customer and team member safety as our top priority.  As of January 2, 2022, substantially all restaurants were open across the Wendy’s system, and the majority of restaurants had dining rooms open. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, our customer counts and systemwide sales were significantly negatively impacted, and our customer counts continue to be negatively impacted.  Even as mobility continues to increase, customers have been and may continue to be reluctant to return to in-restaurant dining, and consumer spending may continue to be adversely impacted for an extended period of time as a result of decreased consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors. 16The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could again have, an adverse effect on new restaurant development and restaurant reimaging.  For example, in 2020, due to the uncertain and challenging economic and market conditions, we delayed construction of certain new Company-operated restaurants and reimaging of existing Company-operated restaurants and also extended the new restaurant development and Image Activation requirements of our franchisees by one year.  These or similar delays could affect our ability to drive future growth in our business.The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could again have, an adverse effect on our franchisees’ operations and financial condition.  Following the onset of the pandemic, we took certain actions to support our franchisees, including extending payment terms for royalties, extending or abating payment terms for advertising fund contributions and offering to defer base rent payments on properties owned by the Company and leased to franchisees.  To the extent our franchisees experience financial distress, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition through delayed or reduced payments of royalties, advertising fund contributions or rent.The COVID-19 pandemic has led, and could again lead, to interruptions in the delivery of food or other supplies to Wendy’s restaurants arising from delays or restrictions on shipping or manufacturing, closures of supplier or distributor facilities or financial distress or insolvency of suppliers or distributors.  These delays or interruptions could impact the availability of certain food items at Wendy’s restaurants, including beef, chicken, pork and other core menu products.  For example, we experienced disruptions to our beef supply beginning in early May 2020 as beef suppliers across North America faced production challenges.  As a result, some menu items were occasionally in short supply at some Wendy’s system restaurants.  While we and our supply chain partners effectively managed through this disruption and the beef supply subsequently returned to normal levels across the Wendy’s system, the pandemic has continued to impact our supply chain and there can be no assurances that we will not see similar disruptions in the future.  Our results of operations and those of our franchisees could be adversely affected if our key suppliers or distributors are unable to fulfill their responsibilities and we are unable to identify and transition the impacted business to alternative suppliers or distributors in a timely manner.The COVID-19 pandemic has led, and could again lead, to labor shortages or increased labor costs.  The risk or perceived risk of contracting the virus, as well as vaccine mandates or other governmental actions or restrictions, could continue to adversely affect restaurant operations, including the ability or cost of adequately staffing restaurants.  If a significant percentage of our or our franchisees’ workforce is unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, travel limitations, vaccine mandates or other governmental actions or restrictions, our operations and the operations of our franchisees may be negatively impacted, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Following the onset of the pandemic, we took several actions to help support our employees and protect the health and safety of our employees and customers, such as implementing a new emergency sick leave policy, providing temporary wage increases to restaurant employees and purchasing additional sanitation supplies and personal protective materials, which contributed to increased operating costs.The impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources.  We currently believe we have the ability to pursue additional sources of liquidity if needed or desired to fund operating cash requirements or for other purposes.  However, there can be no assurance that additional liquidity will be readily available or available on terms acceptable to us.  If the disruptions caused by COVID-19 worsen, our ability to comply with certain debt covenants under our securitized financing facility could be adversely affected.  Additionally, negative changes to our credit ratings due to the impact or expected impact of COVID-19 could have an adverse effect on our existing indebtedness, our ability to access additional capital, our cost of borrowing and our overall liquidity position and financial condition.In addition to the risks described above, the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, the effect of heightening other risks disclosed in this risk factors section, including, but not limited to, those related to brand value and perception, consumer preferences and spending, commodity costs, labor, supply chain and purchasing, performance of the breakfast daypart and international operations.  We cannot predict the ultimate duration, scope or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or its ultimate impact on our results of operations, financial condition and prospects.Competition from other restaurant companies, as well as grocery chains and other retail food outlets, or poor customer experience at Wendy’s restaurants, could hurt our brand.The market segments in which Wendy’s restaurants compete are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, price, food quality and presentation, service, location, convenience, and the nature and condition of the restaurant facility.  If customers have a poor experience at a Wendy’s restaurant, whether at a Company-operated or franchised restaurant, we may experience a decrease in customer counts.  Further, Wendy’s restaurants compete with a variety of locally owned restaurants, as well as competitive regional, national and global restaurant chains.  Several of these chains compete by offering menu items that are targeted at certain consumer groups or dietary trends.  Additionally, many of our competitors have introduced lower 17cost value meal menu options and have employed marketing strategies that include frequent use of price discounting (including through the use of coupons and other offers), frequent promotions and heavy advertising expenditures.  Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing and marketing strategies better than we can and drive higher levels of brand awareness among consumers.  This product and price competition could result in reduced revenues and loss of market share.    Moreover, new companies, including operators outside the quick-service restaurant industry, may enter market areas in which Wendy’s restaurants operate and target our customer base.  For example, additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases have come from deli sections and in-store cafes of a number of major grocery store chains, as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets.  Such competitors may have, among other things, lower operating costs, better locations, better facilities, more effective marketing and more efficient operations.  Wendy’s also competes with grocery chains and other retail outlets that sell food to be prepared at home.  Competition with these chains and other outlets could increase based on the gap between the price of food prepared at home compared to the price of food purchased at restaurants.  This increased product and price competition could put deflationary pressure on the selling price of products offered at Wendy’s restaurants.  All such competition may adversely affect our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.Adverse economic conditions or disruptions in the national and global economies, or in regions that have a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants, could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.Adverse economic conditions or disruptions in the national and global economies could result in higher unemployment rates, labor shortages, increases in inflation and declines in consumer confidence and spending.  If such disruptions occur, they may result in significant declines in consumer food-away-from-home spending and customer counts in our restaurants and those of our franchisees.  There can be no assurance that government responses to economic disruptions will restore consumer confidence.  Ongoing disruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Additionally, adverse economic conditions in regions that contain a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants, including markets in which our Company-operated restaurants are located, could also have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.Changes in discretionary consumer spending, and in consumer tastes and preferences, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The success of the Wendy’s system depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income.  Material declines in the amount of discretionary spending or consumer food-away-from-home spending could hurt our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our success also depends to a large extent on continued consumer acceptance of our offerings, the success of our operating, promotional, marketing and new product development initiatives and the reputation of our brand.  If we are unable to continue to achieve consumer acceptance or adapt to changes in consumer preferences, including with respect to nutrition, health or dietary trends or environmental or social concerns, Wendy’s restaurants may lose customers, and the resulting revenues from Company-operated restaurants and the royalties that we receive from franchisees may decline.Risks Related to Brand Perception and ValueOur success depends substantially on our corporate reputation and on the value and perception of our brand. Our success depends in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brand, our customers’ loyalty to our brand and a positive relationship with our franchisees and other business partners.  Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities.  Business incidents, whether isolated or recurring, and whether originating from us, our franchisees or our business partners, can significantly reduce brand value and consumer trust, particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation.  For example, our brand could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality or safety of our products or the quality or reputation of our franchisees or other business partners, regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are true.  Our brand could also be adversely impacted by other incidents described in this risk factors section, including incidents related to customer service, customer health or safety, a failure to attract and retain qualified employees, food safety or other health concerns regarding our products, the impact of social media, data privacy violations, cyber incidents, social and environmental sustainability matters or reports of our employees, franchisees or business partners taking controversial positions or acting in an unethical, illegal or socially irresponsible manner.  Any such incidents could cause a decline in consumer confidence in our brand and reduce consumer 18demand for our products, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our results of operations depend in part on the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs and the successful development and launch of new products. Our results of operations are heavily influenced by brand marketing and advertising and by our ability to develop and launch new and innovative products.  Our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful, or we may fail to develop commercially successful new products, which may impact our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.  Moreover, because franchisees contribute to advertising funds based on a percentage of sales at their franchised restaurants, advertising fund expenditures are dependent upon sales volumes across the Wendy’s system.  If systemwide sales decline, this could result in a reduced amount of funds available for our marketing and advertising programs.  In addition, to the extent we use value offerings or other promotions or discounts in our marketing and advertising programs to drive customer counts, these actions may condition our customers to resist higher menu prices or result in reduced demand for premium products.Our inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could adversely impact our brand, business and results of operations. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the use of social media platforms, including social media and news aggregation websites and other forms of internet-based communications that allow individuals access to a broad audience.  The rising popularity of social media has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination and given users the ability to more effectively organize collective actions such as boycotts and other brand-damaging behaviors.  The dissemination of information via social media, whether accurate or inaccurate, could harm our business, brand, reputation, results of operation and financial condition.  This damage may be immediate, without an opportunity to correct inaccurate information or respond to or address particular issues.  In addition, as part of our marketing efforts, we frequently use social media to communicate with consumers in order to build their awareness of, engagement with and loyalty to us.  Failure to use social media effectively or appropriately, particularly as compared to our competitors, could lead to a decline in brand value, customer visits and revenues.   Laws and regulations governing the use of social media continue to rapidly evolve.  A failure by us, our employees, our franchisees or third parties acting on our behalf to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of social media could adversely impact our reputation, brand, results of operations and financial condition or subject us to litigation, fines or other penalties.  Social media risks could also arise from employees not following defined policies for the use of social media during business operations, or actions taken by employees during personal activities outside of their employment, but which could still reflect negatively on the Wendy’s brand.We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and hurt our business.Our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business.  We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and other intellectual property.  The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our continued ability to use our trademarks and service marks to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in existing and new markets.  If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, or if any third party misappropriates, infringes, dilutes or otherwise violates our intellectual property, the value of our brand may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  While we try to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by our franchisees, we cannot ensure that franchisees will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property or the reputation of the Wendy’s brand or restaurant system.  Any damage or violation of our intellectual property could harm our image, brand or competitive position and cause us to incur significant legal fees and diversion of resources.  If we do not attempt or are unable to successfully protect, maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights, there could be a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations as a result of, among other things, consumer confusion, dilution of the Wendy’s brand or increased competition from unauthorized users of our brand. We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions.  Not all of the trademarks that are used in the Wendy’s system have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business or may do business in the future, and some trademarks will never be registered in all of these countries.  Some countries’ laws do not protect unregistered trademarks at all, or make them more difficult to enforce, and third parties have filed, or may in the future file, for “Wendy’s” or similar marks.  Accordingly, we may not be able to adequately protect the Wendy’s brand everywhere in the world and use of the Wendy’s brand may result in liability for trademark infringement, trademark dilution or unfair competition.  In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect 19intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.  We cannot ensure that all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate.  We cannot ensure that third parties will not bring infringement claims against us in the future.  Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, cause delays in introducing new menu items, require costly modifications to advertising and promotional materials, harm our brand, image, competitive position or ability to expand our operations into other jurisdictions, cause us to incur significant costs related to defense or settlement or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.  As a result, any such claim could harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, third parties may assert that certain of our intellectual property, or our rights therein, are invalid or unenforceable.  If our rights in any of our intellectual property were found to infringe third-party rights, or portions thereof were deemed invalid or unenforceable, we may be forced to defend or resolve related claims and incur related expenses.  In addition, such loss of rights could permit competing uses of such intellectual property which, in turn, could harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.Food safety events or health concerns regarding our products could create negative publicity and adversely affect our brand, business and results of operations.Food safety is a top priority for Wendy’s, and we dedicate substantial resources to food safety matters to ensure our customers enjoy safe, quality food products.  However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. coli), have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future.  Food safety events, whether or not involving Wendy’s restaurants or other restaurant companies, could adversely affect the price and availability of certain products and result in negative publicity for Wendy’s or the restaurant industry.  This negative publicity may reduce demand for Wendy’s food and could result in a decrease in customer counts to Wendy’s restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types.  Any report linking our restaurants or suppliers to food-borne illnesses, food tampering, contamination or mislabeling or other food-safety issues could damage the value of our brand immediately and severely hurt sales of our products and possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) or other damages.  The Wendy’s system may also be adversely impacted by consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of the products we sell, the ingredients in our products or the cooking processes used in our restaurants.  These or similar concerns could result in less demand for our products and a decline in sales at Company-operated restaurants and in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.Risks Related to Our Business StrategyOur predominantly franchised business model presents a number of risks.As of January 2, 2022, approximately 95% of restaurants in the Wendy’s system were operated by franchisees.  Wendy’s franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with the standards set forth in our franchise and other agreements with them.  Wendy’s also provides training and support to franchisees.  However, franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants.  Specifically, franchisees are solely responsible for developing and utilizing their own policies and procedures, making their own hiring, firing and disciplinary decisions, scheduling hours and establishing wages, and managing their day-to-day employment processes and procedures in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, all of which is done independent of Wendy’s.  Further, franchisees have discretion as to the prices charged to customers.  As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee.  If franchisees do not successfully operate their restaurants in a manner consistent with required standards, their royalty payments to us could be adversely affected and our brand’s image and reputation could be harmed, both of which in turn could hurt our business and results of operations.  In addition, the failure of franchisees to adequately engage in succession planning may adversely affect their restaurant operations and development of new Wendy’s restaurants, which in turn could hurt our business and results of operations.Wendy’s franchisees are an integral part of our business, growth and brand strategies.  We may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategies if franchisees do not participate in the implementation of those strategies.  Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if a significant number of franchisees do not participate in brand strategies, such as new restaurant development, Image Activation, digital commerce platforms and technologies and execution of the breakfast daypart, which in turn may harm our business and financial condition.  In addition, Wendy’s current franchise model, and the way our brand strategies are executed across the system, may make it difficult for our brand to respond and adapt to the speed of change in technology, consumer preferences, the regulatory environment or other factors as quickly as may be required to maintain and grow market share and remain competitive.  Certain of our competitors that have a significantly higher 20percentage of company-operated restaurants than we do may have greater influence over their respective restaurant systems and greater ability to implement operational initiatives and business strategies.We receive revenues in the form of royalties and national advertising funds contributions (both of which are generally based on a percentage of sales at franchised restaurants), as well as rent and fees from franchisees.  Accordingly, a substantial portion of our financial results is to a large extent dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees.  If sales trends or economic conditions worsen for franchisees, or if the overall business or financial health of franchisees deteriorates, their results of operations or financial condition may worsen and our royalty, national advertising funds, rent and other fee revenues may decline and our accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts may increase.  Additionally, when Company-operated restaurants with leased real estate are sold to franchisees, we are often required to remain responsible for lease payments for these restaurants in the event the purchasing franchisees default on their leases.  If franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements or fail to perform under or extend their leases or subleases with us, or if we are unable to identify, attract and retain new franchisees who meet our criteria, then our royalty and rental revenues may decrease and our future growth could be adversely affected.The growth of our business is dependent on new restaurant openings, which could be affected by factors beyond our control.Our business derives earnings from sales at Company-operated restaurants as well as royalties and other fees received from franchised restaurants.  Growth in our revenues and earnings is dependent on new restaurant openings.  Numerous factors beyond our control may adversely affect new restaurant openings, which in turn could hurt our business and results of operations.  These factors include, among others, (i) our ability to attract new franchisees; (ii) the availability of site locations for new restaurants; (iii) the ability of restaurant owners to obtain financing; (iv) the ability of restaurant owners to attract, train and retain qualified operating personnel; (v) construction and development costs, particularly in highly competitive markets; (vi) the ability of restaurant owners to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all; and (vii) adverse weather conditions.  Our inability to identify suitable locations, achieve consumer acceptance or otherwise execute our development strategy could have an adverse impact on our future growth, results of operation and financial condition.Our growth strategy also includes an increased focus on non-traditional development, such as fuel and transportation centers, food courts and other retail locations, military bases and delivery kitchens.  The inability of us or our franchisees to execute our non-traditional development strategy, including meeting development goals, achieving anticipated sales results and upholding the value of the Wendy’s brand, could have an adverse impact on our future growth, results of operations and financial condition.Our Image Activation program may not positively affect sales or improve our results of operations, and franchisees may not participate in our Image Activation program to the extent expected by us.We continue to implement our Image Activation program, which includes reimaging existing Wendy’s restaurants and building new Wendy’s restaurants with innovative exterior and interior restaurant designs.  Our Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at Wendy’s restaurants or improve our results of operations.  There can also be no assurance that franchisees will participate in the Image Activation program to the extent expected by the Company.  In order to support our Image Activation program and promote new restaurant development, we have provided franchisees with certain incentive programs for qualifying new and reimaged restaurants, including reductions in royalty and national advertising payments and options for the early renewal of franchise agreements.  It is possible we may provide additional financial incentives to franchisees, which could result in additional expenses, a reduction of royalties or other revenues or the incurrence of other costs or liabilities.  Some franchisees may need to borrow funds in order to participate in the Image Activation program.  If franchisees are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, they may be unwilling or unable to invest in the reimaging of their existing restaurants or the development of new restaurants, and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.We may be unable to manage effectively the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, or successfully implement other strategic initiatives, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results.We continue to optimize the Wendy’s system through our system optimization initiative, which includes facilitating the transfer of restaurants between and among franchisees, as well as evaluating strategic acquisitions of franchised restaurants and strategic dispositions of Company-operated restaurants to existing and new franchisees, to further strengthen the franchisee base, drive new restaurant development and accelerate adoption of our Image Activation program.  The success of this initiative is dependent upon many factors, such as the availability of sellers and buyers, the availability of financing, the ability to 21negotiate transactions on terms deemed acceptable and the ability to successfully transition and integrate restaurant operations.  Acquisitions of franchised restaurants pose various risks to our operations, including (i) diversion of management’s attention to the integration of acquired restaurant operations; (ii) increased operating expenses and the inability to achieve expected cost savings and operating efficiencies; (iii) exposure to liabilities arising out of prior operations of acquired restaurants; and (iv) the assumption of long-term, non-cancelable leases.  Our system optimization initiative also places demands on our operational and financial management resources and may require us to expand these resources.  If we are unable to execute our system optimization initiative or effectively manage the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.In addition, Wendy’s from time to time evaluates and may pursue other opportunities for growth, including through new and existing franchise partners, joint venture investments, expansion of our brand through other opportunities and strategic mergers, acquisitions and divestitures.  These strategic initiatives involve various risks, including general transaction and business risk, integration and synergy risk, market acceptance risk and risks associated with the diversion of management.  Strategic transactions may not ultimately create value for us or our stockholders and may harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our leasing and ownership of significant amounts of real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses, including liabilities associated with environmental matters.We have significant real estate operations in connection with our business and are subject to the normal risks associated with leasing and owning real estate.  Our real estate values and the costs associated with our real estate operations are impacted by a variety of factors, including changes in the investment climate for real estate, macroeconomic trends, governmental regulations, insurance, demographic trends, supply chain management, supply and demand for the ownership and operation of restaurants and environmental matters.  A significant change in real estate values, or an increase in costs as result of any of these factors, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances.  These environmental laws provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner, operator or occupant of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances.  Third parties may also make claims against owners, operators or occupants of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of or exposure to such substances.  A number of our restaurant sites were formerly gas stations or are adjacent to current or former gas stations or were used for other commercial activities that can create environmental impacts.  We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of all of our properties and we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our leased and owned properties, and any such liabilities identified in the future could cause us to incur significant costs, including costs associated with litigation, fines or clean-up responsibilities.  We cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with any environmental laws or regulations or to satisfy any such claims.We generally secure long-term real estate interests for our leased restaurants and have limited flexibility to quickly alter our real estate portfolio.  Many leases provide that the landlord may increase the rent over the term of the lease and any renewals of the term.  Most leases require us to pay the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance, utilities and capital repairs and replacements.  We generally cannot cancel these leases prior to the expiration of their term.  If an existing or future restaurant is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying rent, taxes and maintenance costs for the balance of the lease term.  In addition, as each lease expires, we may fail to negotiate additional renewals or renewal options, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close restaurants in desirable locations, negatively impacting our results of operations.The breakfast daypart is competitive across the restaurant industry and we may be unable to achieve or maintain market share or reach targeted levels of breakfast sales and profits.Wendy’s entered the breakfast daypart across the U.S. system in March 2020 and recently announced plans to launch breakfast in Canada in the second quarter of 2022.  The Company and franchisee leadership worked closely to align on a breakfast program designed to drive incremental sales and profits through a strong economic model.  However, we may be unable to achieve market share and reach targeted levels of breakfast sales and profits due to competitive pressures and responses from our competitors, some of whom are well-established in the breakfast daypart, or other factors, including operational complexity, food and labor costs, supply chain management, lack of consumer acceptance, discretionary spending patterns that differ from other dayparts and changes to customer mobility and daily routines, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  In addition, breakfast sales could cannibalize sales during other parts of the day and may have negative 22impacts on restaurant margins.  The continued active support and engagement of our franchisees is also critical for the successful performance of the breakfast daypart.  The breakfast daypart may require significant financial resources, including the Company’s plans to fund incremental marketing and advertising campaigns.  Our inability to successfully execute on our strategy for the breakfast daypart could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our international operations are subject to various risks and uncertainties and there is no assurance that our international operations will continue to be profitable.In addition to many of the factors described in this risk factors section, our business outside of the United States is subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including international economic and political conditions, risk of corruption and violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws of other countries, the inability to adapt to differing cultures or consumer preferences, inadequate brand infrastructure to support our international activities, inability to obtain adequate supplies meeting our quality standards and product specifications or interruptions in obtaining such supplies, challenges and risks associated with managing and monitoring suppliers, restrictions on our ability to move cash out of certain foreign countries, currency regulations and fluctuations, diverse government regulations and tax systems, uncertain or differing interpretations of rights and obligations in connection with international franchise agreements, the collection of royalties and other fees from international franchisees, the inability to protect technology, data or intellectual property rights, compliance with international privacy and information security laws and regulations, the availability and cost of land, construction costs, other legal, financial or regulatory impediments to the development or operation of restaurants, the inability to identify, attract and retain experienced management, qualified franchisees and joint venture partners and ongoing disruptions and impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Adverse conditions or unforeseen events in countries that contain a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants (including Canada, our largest international market), could have a material adverse impact on our international growth strategy and results of operations.  In addition, to the extent we invest in international Company-operated restaurants or joint ventures, we would also have the risk of operating losses related to those restaurants, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  There can be no assurance that our international growth strategy will be successful or that our international operations will be profitable.  Wendy’s opened Company-operated and franchised restaurants in the United Kingdom in 2021 and plans to expand into other anchor markets in Europe utilizing a franchise model.  New markets may have low brand awareness as well as competitive conditions, consumer tastes, discretionary spending patterns and social and cultural differences that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets.  We may need to make greater investments than we originally planned in advertising and promotional activity to build brand awareness, which could negatively impact the profitability of our operations.  In addition, we may be unable to obtain desirable locations for new restaurants at reasonable prices, or at all, and restaurants may have higher construction, occupancy, food and labor costs than we currently anticipate.  Any of these risks and uncertainties, and other factors we cannot anticipate, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Risks Related to Supply Chain and LaborChanges in commodity costs and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations.Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken, pork, dairy and grains), supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs, including labor costs.  Increases in commodity costs, particularly beef or chicken prices, could adversely affect our future results of operations.  Our business is susceptible to increases in commodity and other operating costs as a result of various factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, inflation, industry demand, energy costs, food safety concerns, animal disease outbreaks, product recalls   and government regulations.  Increasing weather volatility or other long-term changes in weather patterns, including related to climate change, could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of our ingredients.  In addition, our supply chain is subject to increased costs arising from actual or perceived effects of climate change, greenhouse gas emissions and scarcity of energy and water resources.  The ongoing and long-term costs of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business if not properly mitigated.  We could also be adversely impacted by the cost of products raised or grown in accordance with our responsible sourcing criteria, including those related to environmental sustainability and animal welfare, as availability of products that can be assured to meet those criteria are generally smaller and more concentrated, and may be more costly, than the markets for conventionally raised or grown products that are not assured to meet those criteria.  Significant increases in expenses incurred by consumers, such as living expenses or gasoline prices, could also result in decreased customer counts at our restaurants, which could adversely affect our business.  We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing commodity costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to 23do so could adversely affect our results of operations.  In addition, we may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to our customers.  If increased costs were passed to our customers, demand for our products may decrease, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations.Shortages or interruptions in the supply or distribution of perishable food products could damage our brand and adversely affect our business and results of operations.Wendy’s and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet brand specifications.  Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, labor shortages, disease or food-borne illnesses, political unrest, health epidemics or pandemics, inclement weather or other calamities or conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which could lower revenues, increase operating costs, damage brand reputation and otherwise harm our business and the businesses of our franchisees.  Certain of the products sold in our restaurants, such as beef and chicken, are sourced from a limited number of suppliers, which may increase our reliance on those suppliers.  In addition, our system relies on a limited number of in-line distributors to deliver certain food, packaging and beverage products to our restaurants.  If a disruption of service from any of our key suppliers or distributors was to occur, we could experience short-term increases in our costs while supply and distribution channels were adjusted, and we may be unable to identify or negotiate with new suppliers or distributors on terms that are commercially reasonable to us.  As discussed above, the COVID-19 pandemic has led, and could again lead, to delays or interruptions in the delivery of food or other supplies to Wendy’s restaurants, which could impact the availability and cost of certain food items at Wendy’s restaurants.We do not exercise ultimate control over purchasing for our restaurant system, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.While we require and seek to ensure that all suppliers to the Wendy’s system meet certain quality control standards, our franchisees ultimately control the purchasing of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies from third party suppliers through QSCC, Wendy’s independent purchasing co-op.  QSCC manages, for the Wendy’s system in the United States and Canada, contracts for the purchase and distribution of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies under national agreements with pricing based on total system volume.  We do not control the decisions and activities of QSCC.  If QSCC does not properly estimate the product needs of the Wendy’s system, makes poor purchasing decisions or ceases its operations, or if our relationship with QSCC is terminated for any reason, system sales, operating costs and supply chain management could be adversely affected, which could harm our franchisees and have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our business could be hurt by increased labor costs or labor shortages.Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our restaurants.  We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our managers and hourly employees.  Increased labor costs due to competition, increased wages or employee benefits costs (including various federal, state and local actions to increase minimum wages), unionization activity or other factors would adversely impact our cost of sales and operating expenses.  In addition, Wendy’s success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and staff as well as employees and key personnel at our restaurant support center, and our inability to do so could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  Our business, results of operations and brand perception could also be adversely impacted by unionization efforts or other campaigns by labor organizations affecting our employees or the employees of our franchisees or by our responses to any such efforts or campaigns.  As discussed above, the COVID-19 pandemic has led, and could again lead, to increased labor costs and labor shortages, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our success depends in part upon the continued succession and retention of certain key personnel and the effectiveness of our leadership structure.We believe that over time our success has been dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior leadership team and other key personnel.  Our failure to retain members of our senior leadership team or other key personnel could adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts we have undertaken to increase the efficiency and performance of our business.  In addition, changes to our leadership and organizational structure can be inherently difficult to manage, and if we are unable to implement any such changes effectively, our business, results of operations and financial results could be adversely affected.24Risks Related to Technology and CybersecurityThere are risks and uncertainties associated with our increasing dependence on digital commerce platforms and technologies and alternative methods of delivery.Advances in technologies, including advances in digital food ordering and delivery technologies, and changes in consumer behavior driven by such advances could have a negative effect on our business.  Technology and consumer offerings continue to develop and evolve, and we expect that new and enhanced technologies and consumer offerings will be available in the future, including those with a focus on restaurant modernization, restaurant technology, digital engagement, online ordering and delivery.  Our inability to predict consumer acceptance of new technology or our failure to adequately invest in new technology or adapt to technological developments, industry trends and evolving legal and regulatory requirements could result in a loss of customers and related market share.  In addition, our competitors, some of whom have greater resources than we do, may be able to benefit from changes in technologies or consumer acceptance of such changes, which could harm our competitive position and brand.  An increasing amount of our sales and revenues is derived from digital orders, which includes online ordering and delivery.  We have implemented technology and targeted advertising and promotions to support the growth of our digital business.  If we are unable to continue to grow our digital business, it may be difficult for us to achieve our planned sales growth.  If our digital commerce platforms, including the Wendy’s mobile app and online ordering system, do not meet customers’ expectations in terms of security, privacy, speed, attractiveness or ease of use, customers may be less inclined to return to those platforms, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our business could also be negatively impacted if we are unable to successfully implement or execute other consumer-facing digital initiatives, such as mobile order pick-up and carryout.  We rely on third-party delivery services to fulfill delivery orders, and errors or failures by those providers to make timely deliveries could cause customers to stop ordering from us.  The third-party restaurant delivery business is intensely competitive, with a number of companies competing for capital, market share, online traffic and delivery drivers.  If the third-party delivery services that we utilize cease or curtail their operations, increase their fees or give greater priority or promotions on their platforms to our competitors, our delivery business and our sales may be negatively impacted.  If we are unable to successfully respond to the challenges arising from our increased reliance on our digital business, this could have a material adverse impact on our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.We are heavily dependent on computer systems and information technology and any material failure, misuse, interruption or breach of our systems or technology could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are heavily dependent on our computer systems and information technology, including those controlled by third-party providers, to conduct our business, including point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures.  Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of our systems and technology.  The failure of our systems and technology to operate effectively, an interruption in our systems or technology or a breach in security of our systems or technology could be harmful and cause delays in customer service, result in the loss of data, reduce efficiency or cause delays in operations.  Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any such problems or to maintain or upgrade our systems and technology or transition to replacement systems or technology.  Additionally, the success of certain of our strategic initiatives, including the expansion and acceleration of our consumer-facing digital capabilities to connect with customers and drive growth, is highly dependent on our systems and technology.  Any security breach involving our or our franchisees’ systems or technology could result in a loss of consumer confidence and potential costs associated with fraud.  Also, despite our considerable efforts and resources to secure our systems and technology, security breaches, such as unauthorized access and computer viruses, may occur, resulting in system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, which in turn could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are dependent to a significant extent on our ongoing relationship with key technology providers, including their personnel, resources, technological expertise, systems and technology and their ability to help execute our digital, restaurant technology and enterprise technology initiatives and support our technology innovation and growth.  The inability of us or our providers to successfully execute our technology growth initiatives while maintaining our brand value and perception could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.25The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in cybersecurity, could negatively impact our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.A number of retailers and other companies have experienced serious cyber incidents and breaches of their information technology systems, such as unauthorized access, phishing attacks, account takeovers, denial of service, computer viruses, introduction of malware or ransomware and other disruptive problems caused by malicious actors.  As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our systems, both internal and those managed by third parties.  Our business involves the collection and retention of customer data, including, in some instances, credit and debit card numbers and other personally identifiable information, in various information systems that we and our franchisees maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we and our franchisees contract to provide credit card processing, digital ordering and related services.  We also maintain important internal data, such as personally identifiable information about our employees and franchisees and information relating to our operations.  Our use of personally identifiable information is regulated by international, federal and state laws, as well as by certain third-party agreements.  As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, we will likely incur additional costs to ensure that we remain in compliance with those laws and regulations.  If our security and information systems are compromised or if our employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws, regulations or contract terms, and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect our reputation, disrupt our operations, damage our relationship with customers, franchisees or employees and result in costly litigation, judgments, or penalties resulting from violation of applicable laws and payment card industry regulations.  A cyber incident could also require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity or a loss in consumer confidence, sales and profits, increase fees payable to third parties or cause us to incur penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  While we have implemented various processes, procedures and controls to help mitigate the risk of a cyber incident and maintain insurance coverage to address certain cyber incidents, these measures do not guarantee that a cyber incident could not occur or that our business, reputation and financial condition will not be adversely affected by such an incident.As previously reported, in 2015 and 2016, certain of our franchisees experienced cybersecurity incidents.  As a result of those incidents, the Company was named as a defendant in separate class actions brought by consumers and financial institutions, and certain of our directors and executive officers were named as defendants in a stockholder derivative action.  These and any other claims or investigations related to cybersecurity incidents may adversely affect how we and our franchisees operate the business, divert the attention of management, have a negative effect on our reputation, and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.Risks Related to Our IndebtednessThe Company and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions, and substantially all of the assets of certain subsidiaries are security, under the terms of a securitized financing facility.Wendy’s Funding, LLC, a limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, is the master issuer (the “Master Issuer”) of outstanding senior secured notes under a securitized financing facility entered into in June 2015.  Under the facility, the Master Issuer issued and has outstanding certain series of fixed rate and variable funding notes (collectively, the “Senior Notes”).  The Senior Notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Master Issuer and certain other limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company that act as guarantors (collectively, the “Securitization Entities”), except for certain real estate assets and subject to certain limitations as set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes (the “Indenture”) and the related guarantee and collateral agreement.  The assets of the Securitization Entities include most of the domestic and certain of the foreign revenue-generating assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, which principally consist of franchise-related agreements, certain Company-operated restaurants, intellectual property and license agreements for the use of intellectual property.The Senior Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including that the Master Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Senior Notes, provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments under certain circumstances, certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the assets pledged as collateral for the Senior Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective and covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters.  The Senior Notes are subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service coverage ratios, the sum of global gross sales for specified restaurants being below certain levels on certain measurement dates, certain manager termination events, an event of default and the failure to repay or refinance on the applicable scheduled maturity date.  The Senior Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal, or 26other amounts due on or with respect to the Senior Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective and certain judgments.  In the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the Indenture (including, without limitation, upon an event of default under the Indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the applicable term), the funds available to the Company would be reduced or eliminated, which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business. In addition, the Indenture and the related management agreement contain various covenants that limit the Company and its subsidiaries’ ability to engage in specified types of transactions, subject to certain exceptions, including, for example, to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, sell certain assets, create or incur liens on certain assets to secure indebtedness or consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets.  As a result of these restrictions, the Company may not have adequate resources or flexibility to continue to manage the business and provide for growth of the Wendy’s system, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future growth prospects, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We have a significant amount of debt outstanding, and such indebtedness could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.As of January 2, 2022, the Company had approximately $2.4 billion of outstanding debt on its balance sheet.  Additionally, a subsidiary of the Company has issued variable funding notes, which allows for the borrowing of up to $300.0 million from time to time on a revolving basis.  This level of debt could have significant consequences on the Company’s future operations, including: (i) making it more difficult to meet payment and other obligations under outstanding debt; (ii) resulting in an event of default if the Company’s subsidiaries fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of the Company’s subsidiaries’ debt becoming immediately due and payable; (iii) reducing the availability of the Company’s cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, equity and debt repurchases, dividends, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; (iv) subjecting the Company to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on indebtedness with variable interest rates; (v) limiting the Company’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to, and increasing its vulnerability to, changes in the Company’s business or industry or the general economy; and (vi) placing the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that are less leveraged.  Further, the Company’s outstanding variable funding notes may accrue interest based on the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”), which is expected to be discontinued in 2023.  If LIBOR is discontinued, we may need to renegotiate certain loan documents and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our lenders or the resulting impact on our interest expense.The ability of the Company to make payments on, repay or refinance its debt, and any additional debt, and to fund planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend largely upon its future operating performance and ability to generate significant cash flows.  In addition, the ability of the Company to borrow funds in the future to make payments on its debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in the securitized financing facility and other debt agreements, and other agreements it may enter into in the future.  There can be no assurance that the Company’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the Company’s securitized financing facility or other debt agreements or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable the Company to pay its debt or to fund its dividend and other liquidity needs.In addition to the Company’s outstanding indebtedness, the Company is subject to risks related to certain commitments, guarantees and other liabilities.  For example, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries have significant contractual requirements for the purchase of soft drinks.  If consumer preferences change and customers purchase fewer soft drinks than expected or estimated, such contractual commitments may adversely affect the financial condition of the Company.  The Company has also provided loan guarantees to various lenders on behalf of franchisees entering into debt arrangements for new restaurant development and equipment financing.  In addition, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have been indemnified.  These commitments, guarantees and other liabilities could have an adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity and the ability of its subsidiaries to meet payment obligations.The Company may incur additional indebtedness, guarantees, commitments or other liabilities in the future.  If new debt, guarantees, commitments or other liabilities are added to the Company’s current consolidated debt levels, the related risks that the Company now faces could be amplified.27Risks Related to Our Common StockThere can be no assurance regarding whether or to what extent we will pay dividends on our common stock in the future.Holders of our common stock will only be entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments.  Any dividends will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and such other factors as the Board may deem relevant from time to time.  In addition, because Wendy’s is a holding company, its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent upon cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand and cash flows from its subsidiaries.  The ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to the holding company is dependent upon their ability to achieve sufficient cash flows after satisfying their respective cash requirements, including the requirements and restrictions under our securitized financing facility and other debt agreements. A substantial amount of our common stock is concentrated in the hands of certain stockholders.Nelson Peltz, our Chairman, Peter May, our Senior Vice Chairman, Matthew Peltz, our Vice Chairman, and Edward Garden, a former director of the Company, beneficially own shares of our outstanding common stock that collectively constitute approximately 19% of the Company’s total voting power as of February 22, 2022.  These individuals may, from time to time, acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of common stock.On December 1, 2011, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Trian Agreement”) with Messrs. N. Peltz, May and Garden, and several of their affiliates (the “Covered Persons”).  Pursuant to the Trian Agreement, our Board of Directors, including a majority of the independent directors, approved, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Covered Persons becoming the owners (as defined in Section 203(c)(9)) of or acquiring an aggregate of up to (and including), but not more than, 32.5% (subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Trian Agreement) of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, such that no such persons would be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 203 solely as a result of such ownership.  This concentration of ownership gives these individuals significant influence over the outcome of actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets.  They are also in a position to have significant influence to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.  Our certificate of incorporation contains certain anti-takeover provisions and permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and limits our ability to raise capital from affiliates.Certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation are intended to discourage or delay a hostile takeover of control of the Company.  Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of “blank check” preferred stock, which will have such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors.  Accordingly, our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of our common stock.  The preferred stock could be used to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that is determined by the Board of Directors to be undesirable.  Our certificate of incorporation prohibits the issuance of preferred stock to affiliates, unless offered ratably to the holders of our common stock, subject to an exception in the event that the Company is in financial distress and the issuance is approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.  This prohibition limits our ability to raise capital from affiliates.General Business RisksComplaints or litigation could hurt our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.Wendy’s customers may file complaints or lawsuits against us or our franchisees alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to a Wendy’s restaurant, or alleging that there was a problem with food quality or operations at a Wendy’s restaurant.  We may also be subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims from franchisees, intellectual property claims, data privacy claims and claims alleging violations of law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, including class action lawsuits.  Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management’s attention away from operations, hurt our performance and have a negative impact on our brand.  While we believe we have adequate accruals for all of our legal and environmental 28matters, we cannot estimate the aggregate possible range of loss for our existing litigation and claims due to most proceedings being in preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur, and significant factual matters unresolved.  In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties.  Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions are thus inherently difficult.  Insurance policies contain customary limitations, conditions and exclusions that can affect the amount of insurance proceeds ultimately received.  A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.  Additionally, the restaurant industry has been subject to a number of claims alleging that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have contributed to the obesity or otherwise adversely impacted the health of certain of their customers.  Adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may harm the reputation of our restaurants, even if the allegations are not directed against our restaurants or are not valid.  Moreover, complaints, litigation or adverse publicity experienced by one or more of our franchisees could also hurt our brand or business as a whole.Existing and changing legal and regulatory requirements, as well as an increasing focus on environmental, social and governance issues, could adversely affect our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.Each Wendy’s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, safety and other agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located, as well as to federal laws, rules and regulations and requirements of non-governmental entities such as payment card industry rules.  Governmental authorities may enact laws, rules or regulations that impact restaurant operations and the cost of conducting those operations.  In addition, there can be no assurance that we and our franchisees will not experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for opening new restaurants.  More stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to tax, zoning, land use and environmental factors could also delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.We are subject to various laws and regulations that govern the offer and sale of a franchise, including rules by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  Various state, provincial and foreign laws regulate certain aspects of the franchise relationship, including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises.  The failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales, fines and penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  We could also face lawsuits by franchisees based upon alleged violations of these laws.  We and our franchisees are each also subject to laws and regulations that govern employment matters at the federal/national, state/provincial and local levels.  In the United States, this includes laws like the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, Title VII, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the National Labor Relations Act, family leave, paid sick time and similar requirements and a variety of other laws, regulations and rules.  Changes in laws, regulations, rules and governmental policies, including the interpretation thereof, could increase our costs, require modifications to our business practices, result in increased litigation, investigations, enforcement actions, fines or liabilities and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  For example, a California law enacted in 2019 adopted a worker classification test to be used when determining employee or independent contractor status.  Although we do not believe this law applies to our franchisees or their employees, changes in the legal framework of employment or franchise liability could negatively impact our business, particularly if such changes result in any law, rule, regulation, governmental policy or interpretation or judicial decision determining that Wendy’s is an employer of its franchisees or a joint employer with our franchisees or otherwise imposing liability for employment-related claims or impacting our employment relationships based on theories of joint employer liability or other theories of vicarious liability.  If we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our complex regulatory environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.We are also subject to legal and compliance risks related to privacy and data collection, protection and management of certain data and information associated with our technology-related services and platforms made available to customers, employees, franchisees, business partners or other third parties.  We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations in this area.  These laws and regulations have been subject to frequent change, and there may be jurisdictions that propose or enact new data privacy requirements in the future.  Failure to meet applicable data privacy requirements could result in substantial penalties and adversely impact our business and financial condition.  Additionally, evolving laws and regulations could require us and our franchisees to change or limit the way we collect or use information in operating our business, which may result in additional costs, limit our marketing or growth strategies and adversely affect our business and results of operations. There has been increasing public focus by investors, environmental activists, the media and governmental and nongovernmental organizations on social and environmental sustainability matters, including packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, human rights, climate change, greenhouse gases and land, energy and water use.  As a result, we have 29experienced increased pressure and expectations to provide expanded disclosure and make commitments, establish goals or set targets with respect to various environmental and social issues and to take the actions necessary to meet those commitments, goals and targets.  If we are not effective in addressing social and environmental sustainability matters, consumer trust in our brand may suffer.  In addition, the actions needed to achieve our commitments, goals and targets could result in market, operational, execution and other costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.  Our results of operation and financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to effectively manage the risks or costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain associated with social and environmental sustainability matters.   Our current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims that have been or may be filed.We currently maintain insurance that we believe to be adequate for businesses of our size and type.  However, there are types of losses we could encounter that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters, acts of terrorism or the declaration of war.  In addition, we currently self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under workers’ compensation, general liability, products liability, auto liability and property insurance programs.  Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense, which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We also currently maintain insurance coverage to address cyber incidents.  Applicable insurance policies contain customary limitations, conditions and exclusions, and there can be no assurance that our cyber insurance policies will cover substantially all of the costs and expenses related to any previous or future cyber incidents.  In addition, our future insurance premiums may increase, and we may be unable to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms, or at all, due to challenging conditions in the insurance industry.  Any inadequacy of, or inability to obtain, insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.Changes in accounting standards, or the recognition of impairment or other charges, could adversely affect our future results of operations. New accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, could adversely affect our future results.  We may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our earnings.  In assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets, we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors.  These estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, consumer and demographic trends and restructuring activities.  If our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, or if the operating performance or cash flows of our business decline, we may be required to record impairment charges, which could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results for the affected periods.Tax matters, including changes in tax rates or laws, imposition of new taxes, disagreements with taxing authorities and unanticipated tax liabilities, could impact our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax matters and initiatives around the world.  In particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax rates, laws or policies or related authoritative interpretations.  We are also impacted by the settlement of adjustments proposed by taxing and governmental authorities in connection with our tax reviews and audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope.  While we believe our recorded provision for income taxes properly reflects all applicable tax laws as currently enacted, there can be no assurance that we would be successful in challenging adjustments by the relevant tax authorities.  Any significant increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Our operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.Most of our revenues, costs and indebtedness is denominated in U.S. dollars, which is also our reporting currency.  Our international operations that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated to U.S. dollars for our financial reporting purposes and are impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in currency regulations.  Our exposures to foreign currency risk are primarily related to fluctuations in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar for our Canadian operations.  Unfavorable currency fluctuations could reduce our royalty income and revenues.  While we attempt to minimize our foreign currency risks, our risk management strategies may not be effective and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.30Our results can be adversely affected by unforeseen events, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities, social unrest, health epidemics or pandemics or other catastrophic events.Unforeseen events, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities (including acts of war, terrorist activities and public or workplace violence), social unrest, health epidemics or pandemics or other catastrophic events can adversely affect consumer spending, consumer confidence, restaurant sales and operations, supply chains and our ability to perform corporate or support functions at our restaurant support center, any of which could affect our business, results of operations and financial condition"
5,WEN,WENDY'S CO,2021-03-03,"Risk Factors
.We wish to caution readers that in addition to the important factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we have included below certain material factors that have affected, or in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results during fiscal 2021, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.Risks Related to Macroeconomic and Industry ConditionsThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt our business, which has materially affected and could continue to materially affect our results of operations, financial condition and prospects for an extended period of time.In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic, and governmental authorities around the world implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19.  These measures adversely affected customers, workforces, economies and financial markets, and, along with decreased consumer spending, led to an economic downturn in many of our markets.  Governmental restrictions and public perceptions of the risks associated with COVID-19 have caused consumers to avoid or limit travel, gatherings in public places and other social interactions, which has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our business.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, we updated our brand standard to include the closure of all dining rooms except where there were specific needs, or a drive-thru or pick-up window option was not available, subject to applicable federal, state and local requirements.  Substantially all Wendy’s restaurants continued to offer drive-thru and delivery service to our customers.  During the second quarter of 2020, we began implementing our restaurant and dining room reopening process through a phased approach in accordance with federal, state and local requirements, with customer and team member safety as 15our top priority.  Dining rooms have been re-opening at each restaurant owner’s discretion, subject to applicable regulatory restrictions.  As of January 3, 2021, approximately 75% of dining rooms were open across the Wendy’s system offering carryout and, in some cases, dine in services.  The COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in the temporary closure of certain restaurants across the Wendy’s system.  As of January 3, 2021, more than 99% of our global systemwide restaurants were operating.  As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our customer counts and systemwide sales have been significantly negatively impacted.  Even as mobility continues to increase, customers have been and may continue to be reluctant to return to in-restaurant dining, and consumer spending may continue to be adversely impacted for an extended period of time as a result of decreased consumer confidence and the impact of lost wages due to increased unemployment.  During the fourth quarter and full year of 2020, global same-restaurant sales increased 4.7% and 1.2%, respectively, primarily driven by the positive impact of our new breakfast daypart in the United States and higher average check, partially offset by a decline in customer counts. The COVID-19 pandemic has also adversely affected new restaurant development and restaurant reimaging.  Due to the uncertain and challenging economic and market conditions, we delayed construction of certain new Company-operated restaurants and reimaging of existing Company-operated restaurants and also extended the new restaurant development and Image Activation requirements of our franchisees by one year.  These delays could affect our ability to drive future growth in our business.The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on our franchisees’ operations and financial condition.  Following the onset of the pandemic, we took certain actions to support our franchisees, including extending payment terms for royalties, extending or abating payment terms for advertising fund contributions and offering to defer base rent payments on properties owned by the Company and leased to franchisees.  To the extent our franchisees experience financial distress, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition through delayed or reduced payments of royalties, advertising fund contributions or rent.The COVID-19 pandemic led, and could again lead, to interruptions in the delivery of food or other supplies to Wendy’s restaurants arising from delays or restrictions on shipping or manufacturing, closures of supplier or distributor facilities or financial distress or insolvency of suppliers or distributors.  These delays or interruptions could impact the availability of certain food items at Wendy’s restaurants, including beef, chicken, pork and other core menu products.  For example, we experienced disruptions to our beef supply beginning in early May 2020 as beef suppliers across North America faced production challenges.  As a result, some menu items were occasionally in short supply at some Wendy’s system restaurants.  While we and our supply chain partners effectively managed through this disruption and the beef supply subsequently returned to normal levels across the Wendy’s system, there can be no assurances that we will not see similar disruptions in the future.  Our results of operations and those of our franchisees could be adversely affected if our key suppliers or distributors are unable to fulfill their responsibilities and we are unable to identify alternative suppliers or distributors in a timely manner or effectively transition the impacted business to new suppliers or distributors.The COVID-19 pandemic could also lead to labor shortages or increased labor costs.  The risk or perceived risk of contracting the virus could adversely affect the ability or cost of adequately staffing restaurants, which could be exacerbated to the extent that the Company or franchisees have employees who test positive for the virus.  If a significant percentage of our or our franchisees’ workforce is unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, travel limitations or other governmental actions or restrictions, our operations and the operations of our franchisees may be negatively impacted, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We took several actions to help support our employees and protect the health and safety of our employees and customers, such as implementing a new emergency sick leave policy, providing temporary wage increases to restaurant employees and purchasing additional sanitation supplies and personal protective materials, which contributed to increased operating costs.The impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources.  We currently believe we have the ability to pursue additional sources of liquidity if needed or desired to fund operating cash requirements or for other purposes.  However, there can be no assurance that additional liquidity will be readily available or available on terms acceptable to us.  If the disruptions caused by COVID-19 worsen, our ability to comply with certain debt covenants under our securitized financing facility could be adversely affected.  Additionally, negative changes to our credit ratings due to the impact or expected impact of COVID-19 could have an adverse effect on our existing indebtedness, our ability to access additional capital, our cost of borrowing and our overall liquidity position and financial condition.16In addition to the risks described above, the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, the effect of heightening other risks disclosed in this risk factors section, including, but not limited to, risks related to competition, economic conditions and disruptions, brand value and perception, consumer preferences and spending, commodity costs, labor, supply chain and purchasing, new restaurant development and reimaging, performance of the breakfast daypart, franchisees, leasing and ownership of real estate, international operations, digital commerce and technology, cybersecurity, our securitized financing facility and levels of indebtedness, complaints or litigation, legal and regulatory requirements, impairment charges and payment of future dividends.  We cannot predict the ultimate duration, scope or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or its ultimate impact on our results of operations, financial condition and prospects.Competition from other restaurant companies, as well as grocery chains and other retail food outlets, or poor customer experience at Wendy’s restaurants, could hurt our brand.The market segments in which Wendy’s restaurants compete are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, price, food quality and presentation, service, location, convenience, and the nature and condition of the restaurant facility.  If customers have a poor experience at a Wendy’s restaurant, whether at a Company-operated or franchised restaurant, we may experience a decrease in customer counts.  Further, Wendy’s restaurants compete with a variety of locally owned restaurants, as well as competitive regional, national and global restaurant chains.  Several of these chains compete by offering menu items that are targeted at certain consumer groups or dietary trends.  Additionally, many of our competitors have introduced lower cost value meal menu options and have employed marketing strategies that include frequent use of price discounting (including through the use of coupons and other offers), frequent promotions and heavy advertising expenditures.  Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing and marketing strategies better than we can and drive higher levels of brand awareness among consumers.  This product and price competition could result in reduced revenues and loss of market share.    Moreover, new companies, including operators outside the quick-service restaurant industry, may enter market areas in which Wendy’s restaurants operate and target our customer base.  For example, additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases have come from deli sections and in-store cafes of a number of major grocery store chains, as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets.  Such competitors may have, among other things, lower operating costs, better locations, better facilities, more effective marketing and more efficient operations.  Wendy’s also competes with grocery chains and other retail outlets that sell food to be prepared at home.  Competition with these chains and other outlets has increased due to the gap between the price of food prepared at home compared to the price of food purchased at restaurants.  This increased product and price competition could put deflationary pressure on the selling price of products offered at Wendy’s restaurants.  All such competition may adversely affect our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.Disruptions in the national and global economies, or in regions that have a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants, could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.Disruptions in the national and global economies could result in higher unemployment rates and declines in consumer confidence and spending.  If such disruptions occur, they may result in significant declines in consumer food-away-from-home spending and customer counts in our restaurants and those of our franchisees.  There can be no assurance that government responses to economic disruptions will restore consumer confidence.  Ongoing disruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Additionally, adverse economic conditions in regions that contain a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants, including markets in which our Company-operated restaurants are located, could also have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.Changes in discretionary consumer spending, and in consumer tastes and preferences, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The success of the Wendy’s system depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income.  Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending or a decline in consumer food-away-from-home spending could hurt our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our success also depends to a large extent on continued consumer acceptance of our offerings, the success of our operating, promotional, marketing and new product development initiatives and the reputation of our brand.  If we are unable to continue to achieve consumer acceptance or adapt to changes in consumer preferences, including with respect to nutrition, health or dietary trends or environmental or social concerns, Wendy’s restaurants may lose customers, and the resulting revenues from Company-operated restaurants and the royalties that we receive from franchisees may decline.17Risks Related to Brand Perception and ValueOur success depends substantially on our corporate reputation and on the value and perception of our brand. Our success depends in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brand, our customers’ loyalty to our brand and a positive relationship with our franchisees and other business partners.  Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities.  Business incidents, whether isolated or recurring, and whether originating from us, our franchisees or our business partners, can significantly reduce brand value and consumer trust, particularly if the incidents receive considerable publicity or result in litigation.  For example, our brand could be damaged by claims or perceptions about the quality or safety of our products or the quality or reputation of our franchisees or other business partners, regardless of whether such claims or perceptions are true.  Our brand could also be adversely impacted by other incidents described in this risk factors section, including incidents related to customer service, customer health or safety, a failure to attract and retain qualified employees, food safety or other health concerns regarding our products, the impact of social media, data privacy violations, cyber incidents or reports of our employees, franchisees or business partners taking controversial positions or acting in an unethical, illegal or socially irresponsible manner.  Any such incidents could cause a decline in consumer confidence in our brand and reduce consumer demand for our products, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our results of operations depend in part on the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs and the successful development and launch of new products. Our results of operations are heavily influenced by brand marketing and advertising and by our ability to develop and launch new and innovative products.  Our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful or we may fail to develop commercially successful new products, which may impact our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.  Moreover, because franchisees contribute to advertising funds based on a percentage of gross sales at their franchise restaurants, advertising fund expenditures are dependent upon sales volumes across the Wendy’s system.  If systemwide sales decline, this could result in a reduced amount of funds available for our marketing and advertising programs.  In addition, to the extent we use value offerings or other promotions or discounts in our marketing and advertising programs to drive customer counts, these actions may condition our customers to resist higher menu prices or result in reduced demand for premium products.Our inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could adversely impact our brand, business and results of operations. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the use of social media platforms, including social media and news aggregation websites and other forms of internet-based communications that allow individuals access to a broad audience.  The rising popularity of social media has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination and given users the ability to more effectively organize collective actions such as boycotts and other brand-damaging behaviors.  The dissemination of information via social media, whether accurate or inaccurate, could harm our business, brand, reputation, results of operation and financial condition.  This damage may be immediate, without an opportunity to correct inaccurate information or respond to or address particular issues.  In addition, as part of our marketing efforts, we frequently use social media to communicate with consumers in order to build their awareness of, engagement with, and loyalty to us.  Failure to use social media effectively or appropriately, particularly as compared to our competitors, could lead to a decline in brand value, customer visits and revenues.   Laws and regulations governing the use of social media continue to rapidly evolve.  A failure by us, our employees, our franchisees or third parties acting on our behalf to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of social media could adversely impact our reputation, brand, results of operations and financial condition or subject us to litigation, fines or other penalties.  Social media risks could also arise from employees not following defined policies for the use of social media during business operations, or actions taken by employees during personal activities outside of their employment, but which could still reflect negatively on the Wendy’s brand.We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and hurt our business.Our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business.  We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and other intellectual property.  The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our continued ability to use our trademarks and service marks to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in existing and new markets.  If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, or if any third party misappropriates, infringes, dilutes or otherwise violates our intellectual property, 18the value of our brand may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  While we try to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by all of our franchisees, we cannot ensure that franchisees will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property or the reputation of the Wendy’s brand or restaurant system.  Any damage or violation of our intellectual property could harm our image, brand or competitive position and, if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, cause us to incur significant legal fees and diversion of resources.  Also, if we do not attempt or are unable to successfully protect, maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights, there could be a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations as a result of, among other things, consumer confusion, dilution of the Wendy’s brand or increased competition from unauthorized users of our brand. We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions.  Not all of the trademarks that are used in the Wendy’s system have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business or may do business in the future, and some trademarks will never be registered in all of these countries.  Rights in trademarks are generally national in character and are obtained on a country-by-country basis by the first person to obtain protection through use or registration in that country in connection with specific products or services.  Some countries’ laws do not protect unregistered trademarks at all, or make them more difficult to enforce, and third parties have filed, or may in the future file, for “Wendy’s” or similar marks.  Accordingly, we may not be able to adequately protect the Wendy’s brand everywhere in the world and use of the Wendy’s brand may result in liability for trademark infringement, trademark dilution or unfair competition.  In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.  We cannot ensure that all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate.  We cannot ensure that third parties will not bring infringement claims against us in the future.  Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, cause delays in introducing new menu items, require costly modifications to advertising and promotional materials, harm our brand, image, competitive position or ability to expand our operations into other jurisdictions, cause us to incur significant costs related to defense or settlement or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.  As a result, any such claim could harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, third parties may assert that certain of our intellectual property, or our rights therein, are invalid or unenforceable.  If our rights in any of our intellectual property were found to infringe third-party rights, or portions thereof were deemed invalid or unenforceable, we may be forced to defend or resolve related claims and incur related expenses.  In addition, such loss of rights could permit competing uses of such intellectual property which, in turn, could harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.Food safety events or health concerns regarding our products could create negative publicity and adversely affect our brand, business and results of operations.Food safety is a top priority for Wendy’s, and we dedicate substantial resources to food safety matters to ensure our customers enjoy safe, quality food products.  However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. coli), have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future.  Food safety events, whether or not involving Wendy’s restaurants or other restaurant companies, could adversely affect the price and availability of certain products and result in negative publicity for Wendy’s or the restaurant industry.  This negative publicity may reduce demand for Wendy’s food and could result in a decrease in customer counts to Wendy’s restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types.  Any report linking our restaurants or suppliers to food-borne illnesses or food tampering, contamination, mislabeling or other food-safety issues could damage the value of our brand immediately and severely hurt sales of our products and possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) or other damages.  The Wendy’s system may also be adversely impacted by consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of the products we sell, the ingredients in our products or the cooking processes used in our restaurants.  These or similar concerns could result in less demand for our products and a decline in sales at Company-operated restaurants and in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.Risks Related to Our Business StrategyOur predominantly franchised business model presents a number of risks.As of January 3, 2021, approximately 95% of restaurants in the Wendy’s system were operated by franchisees.  Wendy’s franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with the standards set forth in our franchise and other agreements with them.  Wendy’s also provides training and support to franchisees.  However, franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants.  Specifically, franchisees are solely responsible for developing and utilizing their own policies and procedures, 19making their own hiring, firing and disciplinary decisions, scheduling hours and establishing wages, and managing their day-to-day employment processes and procedures, all of which is done independent of Wendy’s and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules or regulations.  Further, franchisees have discretion as to the prices charged to customers.  As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee.  If franchisees do not successfully operate their restaurants in a manner consistent with required standards, their royalty payments to us could be adversely affected and our brand’s image and reputation could be harmed, both of which in turn could hurt our business and results of operations.  In addition, the failure of franchisees to adequately engage in succession planning may adversely affect their restaurant operations and development of new Wendy’s restaurants, which in turn could hurt our business and results of operations.Wendy’s franchisees are an integral part of our business and growth strategy.  We may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategies if franchisees do not participate in the implementation of those strategies.  Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if a significant number of franchisees do not participate in brand strategies, such as new restaurant development, Image Activation, digital commerce platforms and technologies and the execution of breakfast across the U.S. system, which in turn may harm our business and financial condition.  In addition, Wendy’s current franchise model, and the way our brand strategies are executed across the system, may make it difficult for our brand to respond and adapt to the speed of change in technology, consumer preferences, the regulatory environment or other factors as quickly as may be required to maintain and grow market share and remain competitive. Certain of our competitors that have a significantly higher percentage of company-operated restaurants than we do may have greater influence over their respective restaurant systems and greater ability to implement operational initiatives and business strategies.We receive revenues in the form of royalties and national advertising funds contributions (both of which are generally based on a percentage of sales at franchised restaurants), as well as rent and fees from franchisees.  Accordingly, a substantial portion of our financial results is to a large extent dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees.  If sales trends or economic conditions worsen for franchisees, or if the overall business or financial health of franchisees deteriorates, their results of operations or financial condition may worsen and our royalty, national advertising funds, rent and other fee revenues may decline and our accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts may increase.  Additionally, when Company-operated restaurants with leased real estate are sold to franchisees, we are often required to remain responsible for lease payments for these restaurants in the event the purchasing franchisees default on their leases.  During periods of declining sales and profitability, the incidence of franchisee defaults for these lease payments may increase and we may be required to make payments and seek recourse against the franchisee.  In addition, if franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements or we are unable to identify, attract and retain new franchisees who meet our criteria, then our royalty revenues may decrease and our future growth could be adversely affected.The growth of our business is dependent on new restaurant openings, which could be affected by factors beyond our control.Our business derives earnings from sales at Company-operated restaurants as well as royalties and other fees received from franchised restaurants.  Growth in our revenues and earnings is dependent on new restaurant openings.  Numerous factors beyond our control may adversely affect new restaurant openings, which in turn could hurt our business and results of operations.  These factors include, among others, (i) our ability to attract new franchisees; (ii) the availability of site locations for new restaurants; (iii) the ability of restaurant owners to obtain financing; (iv) the ability of restaurant owners to attract, train and retain qualified operating personnel; (v) construction and development costs, particularly in highly competitive markets; (vi) the ability of restaurant owners to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all; and (vii) adverse weather conditions.  Our growth strategy also includes an increased focus on non-traditional development, such as fuel and transportation centers, food courts and other retail locations, military bases, dark kitchens and delivery-only locations.  Our inability to identify suitable locations, achieve consumer acceptance or otherwise execute our non-traditional development strategy could have an adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition.Our Image Activation program may not positively affect sales or improve our results of operations, and franchisees may not participate in our Image Activation program to the extent expected by us.We continue to implement our Image Activation program, which includes reimaging existing Wendy’s restaurants and building new Wendy’s restaurants with innovative exterior and interior restaurant designs.  Our Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at Wendy’s restaurants or improve our results of operations.  There can also be no assurance that franchisees will participate in the Image Activation program to the extent expected by the Company.  In order to support our Image Activation program and promote new restaurant development, we have provided franchisees with certain incentive programs for qualifying new and reimaged restaurants, including reductions in royalty and national advertising payments and options for the early renewal of franchise agreements.  It is possible we may provide additional financial incentives to 20franchisees, which could result in additional expenses, a reduction of royalties or other revenues or the incurrence of other costs or liabilities, such as loan guarantees, interest rate subsidies or collectability of loans.  Some franchisees may need to borrow funds in order to participate in the Image Activation program.  If franchisees are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, they may be unwilling or unable to invest in the reimaging of their existing restaurants or the development of new restaurants, and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.We may be unable to manage effectively the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, or successfully implement other strategic initiatives, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial results.We continue to optimize the Wendy’s system through our system optimization initiative, which includes facilitating the transfer of restaurants between and among franchisees, as well as evaluating strategic acquisitions of franchised restaurants and strategic dispositions of Company-operated restaurants to existing and new franchisees, to further strengthen the franchisee base, drive new restaurant development and accelerate adoption of our Image Activation program.  The success of this initiative is dependent upon many factors, such as the availability of sellers and buyers, the availability of financing, the ability to negotiate transactions on terms deemed acceptable and the ability to successfully transition and integrate restaurant operations.  Acquisitions of franchised restaurants pose various risks to our operations, including (i) diversion of management’s attention to the integration of acquired restaurant operations; (ii) increased operating expenses and the inability to achieve expected cost savings and operating efficiencies; (iii) exposure to liabilities arising out of prior operations of acquired restaurants; and (iv) the assumption of long-term, non-cancelable leases.  Our system optimization initiative places demands on our operational and financial management resources and may require us to expand these resources.  If we are unable to execute our system optimization initiative or effectively manage the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.In addition, Wendy’s from time to time evaluates and may pursue other opportunities for growth through new and existing franchise partners, joint venture investments, expansion of our brand through other opportunities and strategic mergers, acquisitions and divestitures.  These strategic initiatives involve various inherent risks, including, without limitation, general business risk, integration and synergy risk, market acceptance risk and risks associated with the potential distraction of management.  Strategic transactions may not ultimately create value for us or our stockholders and may harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our leasing and ownership of significant amounts of real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses, including liabilities associated with environmental matters.We have significant real estate operations in connection with our business and are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate.  Our real estate values and the costs associated with our real estate operations are impacted by a variety of factors, including changes in the investment climate for real estate, macroeconomic trends, governmental regulations, insurance, demographic trends, supply and demand for the ownership and operation of restaurants and environmental matters. A significant change in real estate values, or an increase in costs as result of any of these factors, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances.  These environmental laws provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner, operator or occupant of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances.  Third parties may also make claims against owners, operators or occupants of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of or exposure to such substances.  A number of our restaurant sites were formerly gas stations or are adjacent to current or former gas stations or were used for other commercial activities that can create environmental impacts.  We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of all of our properties and we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our leased and owned properties, and any such liabilities identified in the future could cause us to incur significant costs, including costs associated with litigation, fines or clean-up responsibilities.  We cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with any environmental laws or regulations or to satisfy any such claims.We generally secure long-term real estate interests for our leased restaurants and have limited flexibility to quickly alter our real estate portfolio.  Many leases provide that the landlord may increase the rent over the term of the lease and any renewals of the term.  Most leases require us to pay the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities.  We generally cannot cancel these leases prior to the expiration of their term.  If an existing or future restaurant is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying rent for the balance of the lease term.  In addition, as each lease expires, we may fail to negotiate additional renewals or renewal 21options, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close restaurants in desirable locations, negatively impacting our results of operations.The breakfast daypart is competitive across the restaurant industry and we may be unable to achieve or maintain market share or reach targeted levels of breakfast sales and profits.Wendy’s entered the breakfast daypart across the U.S. system in March 2020.  The Company and franchisee leadership worked closely to align on a breakfast program designed to drive incremental sales and profits through a strong economic model.  However, we may be unable to achieve market share and reach targeted levels of breakfast sales and profits due to competitive pressures and responses from our competitors, some of whom are well-established in the breakfast daypart, or other factors, including operational complexity, food and labor costs, lack of consumer acceptance, discretionary spending patterns that differ from other dayparts and changes to customer mobility and daily routines, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  In addition, breakfast sales could cannibalize sales during other parts of the day and may have negative impacts on restaurant margins.  The continued active support and engagement of our franchisees is also critical for the successful performance of the breakfast daypart.  The breakfast daypart may require significant financial resources, including the Company’s plans to fund incremental marketing and advertising campaigns.  Our inability to successfully execute on our strategy for the breakfast daypart could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our international operations are subject to various risks and uncertainties and there is no assurance that our international operations will be profitable.In addition to many of the factors described in this risk factors section, our business outside of the United States is subject to a number of additional factors, including international economic and political conditions, risk of corruption and violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws of other countries, the inability to adapt to differing cultures or consumer preferences, inadequate brand infrastructure within foreign countries to support our international activities, inability to obtain adequate supplies meeting our quality standards and product specifications or interruptions in obtaining such supplies, challenges and risks associated with managing and monitoring suppliers, restrictions on our ability to move cash out of certain foreign countries, currency regulations and fluctuations, diverse government regulations and tax systems, uncertain or differing interpretations of rights and obligations in connection with international franchise agreements, the collection of royalties and other fees from international franchisees, the inability to protect technology, data or intellectual property rights, compliance with international privacy and information security laws and regulations, the availability and cost of land, construction costs, other legal, financial or regulatory impediments to the development or operation of new restaurants and the inability to identify, attract and retain experienced management, qualified franchisees and joint venture partners.  Adverse conditions or unforeseen events in countries that contain a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants (including Canada, our largest international market), could have a material adverse impact on our international growth strategy and results of operations.  In addition, to the extent we invest in international Company-operated restaurants or joint ventures, we would also have the risk of operating losses related to those restaurants, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  There can be no assurance that our international growth strategy will be successful or that our international operations will be profitable.  As previously announced, Wendy’s intends to open Company-operated restaurants in the United Kingdom and, if successful, plans to expand into other anchor markets in Europe utilizing a franchise model.  New markets may have low brand awareness as well as competitive conditions, consumer tastes, discretionary spending patterns and social and cultural differences that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets.  We may need to make greater investments than we originally planned in advertising and promotional activity to build brand awareness, which could negatively impact the profitability of our operations.  In addition, we may be unable to obtain desirable locations for new restaurants at reasonable prices, or at all, and restaurants may have higher construction, occupancy, food and labor costs than we currently anticipate.  Moreover, geopolitical risks, including the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union, may result in increased regulatory complexities and economic uncertainty.  Any of these risks and uncertainties, and other factors we cannot anticipate, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Risks Related to Supply Chain and LaborChanges in commodity costs and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations.Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken, pork, cheese and grains), supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs.  Increases in commodity costs, particularly beef or chicken prices, could adversely affect our future results of operations.  Our business is susceptible to 22increases in commodity and other operating costs as a result of various factors beyond our control, such as weather conditions and patterns, demand, food safety concerns, product recalls, federal ethanol policy, fuel costs and government regulations.  Significant increases in expenses incurred by consumers, such as living expenses or gasoline prices, could also result in decreased customer counts at our restaurants, which could adversely affect our business.  We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing commodity costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our results of operations.  In addition, we may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to our customers.  If increased costs were passed to our customers, demand for our products may decrease, which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations.Shortages or interruptions in the supply or distribution of perishable food products could damage our brand and adversely affect our business and results of operations.Wendy’s and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet brand specifications.  Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, disease or food-borne illnesses, political unrest, health epidemics or pandemics, inclement weather or other calamities or conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which could lower revenues, increase operating costs, damage brand reputation and otherwise harm our business and the businesses of our franchisees.  Certain of the products sold in our restaurants, such as beef and chicken, are sourced from a limited number of suppliers, which may increase our reliance on those suppliers.  In addition, our system relies on a limited number of in-line distributors to deliver certain food, packaging and beverage products to our restaurants.  If a disruption of service from any of our key suppliers or distributors was to occur, we could experience short-term increases in our costs while supply and distribution channels were adjusted, and we may be unable to identify or negotiate with new suppliers or distributors on terms that are commercially reasonable to us.  As discussed above, the COVID-19 pandemic led, and could again lead, to delays or interruptions in the delivery of food or other supplies to Wendy’s restaurants, which could impact the availability and cost of certain food items at Wendy’s restaurants.We do not exercise ultimate control over purchasing for our restaurant system, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.While we require and seek to ensure that all suppliers to the Wendy’s system meet certain quality control standards, our franchisees ultimately control the purchasing of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies from third party suppliers through QSCC, Wendy’s independent purchasing co-op.  QSCC manages, for the Wendy’s system in the United States and Canada, contracts for the purchase and distribution of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies under national agreements with pricing based on total system volume.  We do not control the decisions and activities of QSCC.  If QSCC does not properly estimate the product needs of the Wendy’s system, makes poor purchasing decisions or ceases its operations, or if our relationship with QSCC is terminated for any reason, system sales, operating costs and supply chain management could be adversely affected, which could harm our franchisees and have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our business could be hurt by increased labor costs or labor shortages.Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our restaurants.  We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our managers and hourly employees.  Increased labor costs due to competition, increased wages or employee benefits costs (including various federal, state and local actions to increase minimum wages), unionization activity or other factors would adversely impact our cost of sales and operating expenses.  In addition, Wendy’s success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and staff as well as employees and key personnel at our restaurant support center, and our inability to do so could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Our success depends in part upon the continued succession and retention of certain key personnel and the effectiveness of our leadership structure.We believe that over time our success has been dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior leadership team and other key personnel.  Our failure to retain members of our senior leadership team or other key personnel could adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts we have undertaken to increase the efficiency and performance of our business.  In addition, changes to our leadership and organizational structure can be inherently difficult to manage, and if we are unable to implement any such changes effectively, our business, results of operations and financial results could be adversely affected.23Risks Related to Technology and CybersecurityThere are risks and uncertainties associated with our increasing dependence on digital commerce platforms and technologies and alternative methods of delivery.Advances in technologies, including advances in digital food ordering and delivery technologies, and changes in consumer behavior driven by such advances could have a negative effect on our business.  Technology and consumer offerings continue to develop and evolve, and we expect that new and enhanced technologies and consumer offerings will be available in the future, including those with a focus on restaurant modernization, restaurant technology, digital engagement, online ordering and delivery.  Our inability to predict consumer acceptance of new technology or our failure to adequately invest in new technology or adapt to technological developments and industry trends could result in a loss of customers and related market share.  In addition, our competitors, some of whom have greater resources than we do, may be able to benefit from changes in technologies or consumer acceptance of such changes, which could harm our competitive position and brand.  An increasing amount of our sales and revenues is derived from digital orders, which includes online ordering and delivery.  We have implemented technology and targeted advertising and promotions to support the growth of our digital business.  If we are unable to continue to grow our digital business, it may be difficult for us to achieve our planned sales growth.  If our digital commerce platforms, including the Wendy’s mobile app and online ordering system, do not meet customers’ expectations in terms of security, speed, attractiveness or ease of use, customers may be less inclined to return to those platforms, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Our business could also be negatively impacted if we are unable to successfully implement or execute other consumer-facing digital initiatives, such as curbside pick-up and mobile carryout.  We rely on third-party delivery services to fulfill delivery orders, and errors or failures by those providers to make timely deliveries could cause customers to stop ordering from us.  The third-party restaurant delivery business is intensely competitive, with a number of companies competing for capital, market share, online traffic and delivery drivers.  If the third-party delivery services that we utilize cease or curtail their operations, increase their fees or give greater priority or promotions on their platforms to our competitors, our delivery business and our sales may be negatively impacted.  If we are unable to successfully respond to the challenges arising from our increased reliance on our digital business, this could have a material adverse impact on our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.We are heavily dependent on computer systems and information technology and any material failure, misuse, interruption or breach of our systems or technology could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are heavily dependent on our computer systems and information technology to conduct our business, including point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures.  Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems and information technology.  The failure of these systems and information technology to operate effectively, an interruption in such systems or technology or a breach in security of these systems could be harmful and cause delays in customer service, result in the loss of data, reduce efficiency or cause delays in operations.  Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any such problems or to maintain or upgrade our computer systems and information technology or transition to replacement systems.  Additionally, the success of certain of our strategic initiatives, including the expansion and acceleration of our consumer-facing digital capabilities to connect with customers and drive growth, is highly dependent on our technology systems.  Any security breach involving our or our franchisees’ point-of-sale or other systems could result in a loss of consumer confidence and potential costs associated with fraud.  Also, despite our considerable efforts and resources to secure our computer systems and information technology, security breaches, such as unauthorized access and computer viruses, may occur, resulting in system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, which in turn could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.As previously announced, we have implemented a plan to realign and reinvest resources in our IT organization to strengthen our ability to accelerate growth.  We are partnering with a third-party global IT consultant on this new structure to leverage their global capabilities and enable a more seamless integration between our digital and corporate IT assets.  We are dependent to a significant extent on our ongoing relationship and engagement with the consultant, including their personnel and resources, technological expertise and ability to help execute our digital, restaurant technology and enterprise technology initiatives.  The inability of us or the consultant to successfully execute our technology growth initiatives could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.24The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in cybersecurity, could negatively impact our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.A number of retailers and other companies have experienced serious cyber incidents and breaches of their information technology systems.  As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our systems, both internal and those managed by third parties.  Because we and our franchisees accept electronic forms of payment from customers, our business requires the collection and retention of customer data, including credit and debit card numbers and other personally identifiable information, in various information systems that we and our franchisees maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we and our franchisees contract to provide credit card processing and related services.  We also maintain important internal data, such as personally identifiable information about our employees and franchisees and information relating to our operations.  Our use of personally identifiable information is regulated by international, federal and state laws, as well as by certain third-party agreements.  As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, we may incur additional costs to ensure that we remain in compliance with those laws and regulations.  If our security and information systems are compromised or if our employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws, regulations or contract terms, and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect our reputation, disrupt our operations, damage our relationship with customers, franchisees or employees and result in costly litigation, judgments, or penalties resulting from violation of applicable laws and payment card industry regulations.  A cyber incident could also require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity or a loss in consumer confidence, sales and profits, increase fees payable to third parties or cause us to incur penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  While we have implemented various processes, procedures and controls to help mitigate the risk of a cyber incident and maintain insurance coverage to address cyber incidents, these measures do not guarantee that a cyber incident could not occur or that our reputation and financial results will not be adversely affected by such an incident.As previously reported, in 2015 and 2016, certain of our franchisees experienced cybersecurity incidents.  As a result of those incidents, the Company was named as a defendant in separate class actions brought by consumers and financial institutions, and certain of our directors and executive officers were named as defendants in a shareholder derivative action.  These civil proceedings sought damages and other relief allegedly arising from the cybersecurity incidents.  In February 2019, the court granted final approval of the settlement of the consumer class action, and in November 2019, the court granted final approval of the settlement of the financial institutions class action.  Both matters are now considered fully paid and closed.  In January 2020, the court granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement of the putative shareholder derivative action, which remains subject to certain notice and objection provisions and final court approval.  These and any other claims or investigations related to cybersecurity incidents may adversely affect how we and our franchisees operate the business, divert the attention of management, have a negative effect on our reputation, and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.Risks Related to Our IndebtednessThe Company and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions, and substantially all of the assets of certain subsidiaries are security, under the terms of a securitized financing facility.Wendy’s Funding, LLC, a limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, is the master issuer (the “Master Issuer”) of outstanding senior secured notes under a securitized financing facility entered into in June 2015.  Under the facility, the Master Issuer issued and has outstanding certain series of fixed rate and variable funding notes (collectively, the “Senior Notes”).  The Senior Notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Master Issuer and certain other limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company that act as guarantors (collectively, the “Securitization Entities”), except for certain real estate assets and subject to certain limitations as set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes (the “Indenture”) and the related guarantee and collateral agreement.  The assets of the Securitization Entities include most of the domestic and certain of the foreign revenue-generating assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, which principally consist of franchise-related agreements, certain Company-operated restaurants, intellectual property and license agreements for the use of intellectual property.The Senior Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including (i) that the Master Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Senior Notes, (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments under certain circumstances, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the assets pledged as collateral for the Senior Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters.  The Senior Notes are subject to customary rapid 25amortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service coverage ratios, the sum of global gross sales for specified restaurants being below certain levels on certain measurement dates, certain manager termination events, an event of default, and the failure to repay or refinance on the applicable scheduled maturity date.  The Senior Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal, or other amounts due on or with respect to the Senior Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective, and certain judgments.  In the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the Indenture (including, without limitation, upon an event of default under the Indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the applicable term), the funds available to the Company would be reduced or eliminated, which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business. In addition, the Indenture and the related management agreement contain various covenants that limit the Company and its subsidiaries’ ability to engage in specified types of transactions, subject to certain exceptions, including, for example, to (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, (ii) sell certain assets, (iii) create or incur liens on certain assets to secure indebtedness or (iv) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets.  As a result of these restrictions, the Company may not have adequate resources or flexibility to continue to manage the business and provide for growth of the Wendy’s system, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future growth prospects, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We have a significant amount of debt outstanding, and such indebtedness could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.As of January 3, 2021, the Company had approximately $2.2 billion of outstanding debt on its balance sheet.  Additionally, a subsidiary of the Company has issued variable funding notes, which allows for the borrowing of up to $250.0 million from time to time on a revolving basis.  This level of debt could have significant consequences on the Company’s future operations, including: (i) making it more difficult to meet payment and other obligations under outstanding debt; (ii) resulting in an event of default if the Company’s subsidiaries fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of the Company’s subsidiaries’ debt becoming immediately due and payable; (iii) reducing the availability of the Company’s cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, equity and debt repurchases, dividends, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; (iv) subjecting the Company to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on indebtedness with variable interest rates; (v) limiting the Company’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to, and increasing its vulnerability to, changes in the Company’s business, the industry in which it operates and the general economy; and (vi) placing the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that are less leveraged.  Further, the Company’s outstanding variable funding notes may accrue interest based on the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”), which is expected to be discontinued after 2021.  If LIBOR is discontinued, we may need to renegotiate certain loan documents and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our lenders or the resulting impact on our interest expense.The ability of the Company to make payments on, repay or refinance its debt, and any additional debt, and to fund planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend largely upon its future operating performance and ability to generate significant cash flows.  In addition, the ability of the Company to borrow funds in the future to make payments on its debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in the securitized financing facility and other debt agreements, and other agreements it may enter into in the future.  Specifically, the Company will need to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests.  There can be no assurance that the Company’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the Company’s securitized financing facility or other debt agreements or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable the Company to pay its debt or to fund its dividend and other liquidity needs.  If the Company’s subsidiaries are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations, they may need to refinance or restructure debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital.  If the Company’s subsidiaries are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, they may not be able to meet debt payment and other obligations.In addition to the Company’s outstanding indebtedness, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries have significant contractual requirements for the purchase of soft drinks.  If consumer preferences change and customers purchase fewer soft drinks than expected or estimated, such contractual commitments may adversely affect the financial condition of the Company.  The Company has also provided loan guarantees to various lenders on behalf of franchisees entering into debt arrangements for new restaurant development and equipment financing.  In addition, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have been indemnified.  These commitments, 26guarantees and other liabilities could have an adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity and the ability of its subsidiaries to meet payment obligations.The Company may incur additional indebtedness, guarantees, commitments or other liabilities in the future.  If new debt, guarantees, commitments or other liabilities are added to the Company’s current consolidated debt levels, the related risks that the Company now faces could be amplified.Risks Related to Our Common StockThere can be no assurance regarding whether or to what extent we will pay dividends on our common stock in the future.Holders of our common stock will only be entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments.  Any dividends will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and such other factors as the Board may deem relevant from time to time.  In addition, because Wendy’s is a holding company, its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent upon cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand and cash flows from its subsidiaries.  The ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to the holding company is dependent upon their ability to achieve sufficient cash flows after satisfying their respective cash requirements, including the requirements and restrictions under our securitized financing facility and other debt agreements. A substantial amount of our common stock is concentrated in the hands of certain stockholders.Nelson Peltz, our Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, Peter May, our Vice Chairman and former President and Chief Operating Officer, Matthew Peltz, a director of the Company, and Edward Garden, a former director of the Company, beneficially own shares of our outstanding common stock that collectively constitute approximately 19% of the Company’s total voting power as of February 23, 2021.  These individuals may, from time to time, acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of common stock.On December 1, 2011, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Trian Agreement”) with Messrs. N. Peltz, May and Garden, and several of their affiliates (the “Covered Persons”).  Pursuant to the Trian Agreement, our Board of Directors, including a majority of the independent directors, approved, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Covered Persons becoming the owners (as defined in Section 203(c)(9)) of or acquiring an aggregate of up to (and including), but not more than, 32.5% (subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Trian Agreement) of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, such that no such persons would be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 203 solely as a result of such ownership.  This concentration of ownership gives these individuals significant influence over the outcome of actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets.  They are also in a position to have significant influence to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.  Our certificate of incorporation contains certain anti-takeover provisions and permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and limits our ability to raise capital from affiliates.Certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation are intended to discourage or delay a hostile takeover of control of the Company.  Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of “blank check” preferred stock, which will have such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors.  Accordingly, our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of our common stock.  The preferred stock could be used to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that is determined by the Board of Directors to be undesirable.  Our certificate of incorporation prohibits the issuance of preferred stock to affiliates, unless offered ratably to the holders of our common stock, subject to an exception in the event that the Company is in financial distress and the issuance is approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.  This prohibition limits our ability to raise capital from affiliates.27General Business RisksComplaints or litigation could hurt our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.Wendy’s customers may file from time to time complaints or lawsuits against us or our franchisees alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to a Wendy’s restaurant, or alleging that there was a problem with food quality or operations at a Wendy’s restaurant.  We may also be subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims from franchisees, intellectual property claims, data privacy claims and claims alleging violations of law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, including class action lawsuits.  Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management’s attention away from operations, hurt our performance and have a negative impact on our brand.  While we believe we have adequate accruals for all of our legal and environmental matters, we cannot estimate the aggregate possible range of loss for our existing litigation and claims due to most proceedings being in preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur, and significant factual matters unresolved.  In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties.  Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions are thus inherently difficult.  Insurance policies contain customary limitations, conditions and exclusions that can affect the amount of insurance proceeds ultimately received.  A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.  Additionally, the restaurant industry has been subject to a number of claims alleging that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have contributed to the obesity or otherwise adversely impacted the health of certain of their customers.  Adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may harm the reputation of our restaurants, even if the allegations are not directed against our restaurants or are not valid.  Moreover, complaints, litigation or adverse publicity experienced by one or more of our franchisees could also hurt our brand or business as a whole.Existing and changing legal and regulatory requirements, as well as an increasing focus on environmental, social and governance issues, could adversely affect our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.Each Wendy’s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, safety and other agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located, as well as to federal laws, rules and regulations and requirements of non-governmental entities such as payment card industry rules.  State and local government authorities may enact laws, rules or regulations that impact restaurant operations and the cost of conducting those operations.  There can be no assurance that we and our franchisees will not experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants, which could delay the opening of such restaurants in the future.  In addition, more stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to tax, zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.We are subject to various laws and regulations that govern the offer and sale of a franchise, including rules by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  Various state, provincial and foreign laws regulate certain aspects of the franchise relationship, including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises.  The failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales, fines and penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  We could also face lawsuits by franchisees based upon alleged violations of these laws.  We and our franchisees are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, along with the ADA, family leave mandates and a variety of other state laws that govern these and other employment law matters.  Changes in laws, rules, regulations and governmental policies could increase our costs, result in increased litigation, investigations, enforcement actions, fines or liabilities and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  The same consequences may result should any law, rule, regulation, governmental policy or judicial decision declare that Wendy’s is a joint employer with our franchisees.  If we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our complex regulatory environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.We are also subject to legal and compliance risks and associated liability related to privacy and data collection, protection and management as it relates to information associated with our technology-related services and platforms made available to customers, employees, franchisees, business partners or other third parties.  We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations in this area.  These laws and regulations have been subject to frequent change, and there may be jurisdictions that propose or enact new data privacy requirements in the future.  Failure to meet applicable data privacy requirements could result in substantial penalties and materially adversely impact our financial results or brand perceptions.  Additionally, changing laws and regulations could require us and our franchisees to change or limit the way we collect or use 28information in operating our business, which may result in additional costs, limit our marketing or growth strategies and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, there has been increasing public focus by investors, environmental activists, the media and governmental and nongovernmental organizations on social and environmental sustainability matters, including packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, human rights, climate change, carbon footprints and land, energy and water use.  As a result, we have experienced increased pressure and expectations to make commitments, establish goals or set targets with respect to various environmental and social issues and to take the actions necessary to meet those commitments, goals and targets.  If we are not effective in addressing social and environmental sustainability matters, consumer trust in our brand may suffer.  In addition, the actions needed to achieve our sustainability goals could result in market, operational, execution and other costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.Our current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims that have been or may be filed.We currently maintain insurance that we believe to be adequate for businesses of our size and type.  However, there are types of losses we could encounter that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters or acts of terrorism.  In addition, we currently self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under workers’ compensation, general liability, auto liability and property insurance programs.  Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense, which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We also currently maintain insurance coverage to address cyber incidents.  Applicable insurance policies contain customary limitations, conditions and exclusions, and there can be no assurance that our cyber insurance policies will cover substantially all of the costs and expenses related to any previous or future cyber incidents.  In addition, our future insurance premiums may increase, and we may be unable to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms, or at all, due to challenging conditions in the insurance industry.  Any inadequacy of, or inability to obtain, insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.Changes in accounting standards, or the recognition of impairment or other charges, could adversely affect our future results of operations. New accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, could adversely affect our future results.  We may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our earnings.  In assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets, we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors.  These estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, consumer and demographic trends and restructuring activities.  If our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, or if the operating performance or cash flows of our business decline, we may be required to record impairment charges, which could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results for the affected periods.Tax matters, including changes in tax rates or laws, imposition of new taxes, disagreements with taxing authorities and unanticipated tax liabilities, could impact our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax matters and initiatives around the world.  In particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax rates, laws or policies or related authoritative interpretations.  We are also impacted by the settlement of adjustments proposed by taxing and governmental authorities in connection with our tax reviews and audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope.  While we believe our recorded provision for income taxes properly reflects all applicable tax laws as currently enacted, there can be no assurance that we would be successful in challenging adjustments by the relevant tax authorities.  Any significant increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Our operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.Most of our revenues, costs and indebtedness is denominated in U.S. dollars, which is also our reporting currency.  Our international operations that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated to U.S. dollars for our financial reporting purposes and are impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in currency regulations.  29Our exposures to foreign currency risk are primarily related to fluctuations in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar for our Canadian operations.  Unfavorable currency fluctuations could reduce our royalty income and revenues.  While we attempt to minimize our foreign currency risks, our risk management strategies may not be effective and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.Our operations are influenced by adverse weather conditions.Wendy’s restaurant operations are impacted by adverse weather conditions.  Harsh weather conditions that keep customers from dining out can result in lost sales and revenues for our restaurants.  For example, a heavy snowstorm in the Northeast or Midwest or a hurricane in the Southeast can shut down an entire metropolitan area, resulting in a reduction in sales in that area.  Our first quarter includes winter months and historically has a lower level of sales at Company-operated restaurants.  Because a significant portion of our restaurant operating costs is fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of sales during these periods could hurt our operating margins and profits.  For these reasons, quarter-to-quarter comparisons may not be a good indication of the Company’s performance or how we may perform in the future.Our results can be adversely affected by unforeseen events, such as natural disasters, hostilities, social unrest, health epidemics or pandemics or other catastrophic events.Unforeseen events, such as natural disasters, hostilities (including terrorist activities and public or workplace violence), social unrest, health epidemics or pandemics or other catastrophic events can adversely affect consumer spending, consumer confidence, restaurant sales and operations and our ability to perform corporate or support functions at our restaurant support center, any of which could affect our business, results of operations and financial condition"
3,WEN,WENDY'S CO,2020-02-26,"Risk Factors
.We wish to caution readers that in addition to the important factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we have included below the most significant factors that have affected, or in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results during fiscal 2020, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.Competition from other restaurant companies, as well as grocery chains and other retail food outlets, or poor customer experience at Wendy’s restaurants, could hurt our brand.The market segments in which Company-operated and franchised restaurants compete are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, price, food quality and presentation, service, location, convenience, and the nature and condition of the restaurant facility.  If customers have a poor experience at a Wendy’s restaurant, whether at a Company-operated or franchised restaurant, we may experience a decrease in guest traffic.  Further, Wendy’s restaurants compete with a variety of locally-owned restaurants, as well as competitive regional and national chains and franchises.  Several of these chains compete by offering menu items that are targeted at certain consumer groups or dietary trends.  Additionally, many of our competitors have introduced lower cost value meal menu options, and have employed marketing strategies that include frequent use of price discounting (including through the use of coupons and other offers), frequent promotions and heavy advertising expenditures.  Our revenues and those of our franchisees may be hurt by this product and price competition, which in turn could result in reduced revenue and loss of market share.Moreover, new companies, including operators outside the quick-service restaurant industry, may enter market areas in which Wendy’s restaurants operate and target our customer base.  For example, additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases have come from deli sections and in-store cafes of a number of major grocery store chains, as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets.  Such competitors may have, among other things, lower operating costs, better locations, better facilities, better management, better products, more effective marketing and more efficient operations.  Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing and marketing strategies in the quick-service restaurant industry better than we can.  Many of our competitors spend significantly more on advertising and marketing than we do, which may give them a competitive advantage through higher levels of brand awareness among consumers. 12Wendy’s also competes with grocery chains and other retail outlets that sell food to be prepared at home.  Competition with these chains and other outlets has increased due to the gap between the price of food prepared at home compared to the price of food purchased at restaurants.  This increased product and price competition could put deflationary pressure on the selling price of products offered at Wendy’s restaurants.All such competition may adversely affect our revenues and profits by reducing revenues of Company-operated restaurants and royalty revenue from franchised restaurants.Changes in consumer tastes and preferences, and in discretionary consumer spending, could result in a decline in sales at Company-operated restaurants and in the royalties that we receive from franchisees.The quick-service restaurant industry is affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions, discretionary spending priorities, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants.  Our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income.  Accordingly, we may experience declines in sales during economic downturns.  Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending or a decline in consumer food-away-from-home spending could hurt our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.  The success of the Wendy’s system also depends, to a large extent, on continued consumer acceptance of our offerings, the success of our operating, promotional, marketing and new product development initiatives and the reputation of the Wendy’s brand.  If we are unable to continue to achieve consumer acceptance or adapt to changes in consumer preferences, nutrition, health or dietary trends (e.g., plant-based food, alternative proteins, low carbohydrate, low trans-fat, gluten free or antibiotic free) or sustainability, animal welfare or other environmental or social concerns, Wendy’s restaurants may lose customers, and the resulting revenues from Company-operated restaurants and the royalties that we receive from franchisees may decline.Disruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.Disruptions in the national and global economies could result in higher unemployment rates and declines in consumer confidence and spending.  If such disruptions occur, they may result in significant declines in consumer food-away-from-home spending and customer traffic in our restaurants and those of our franchisees.  There can be no assurance that government responses to economic disruptions will restore consumer confidence.  Ongoing disruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.Changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken, pork, cheese and grains), supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations.Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken, pork, cheese and grains), supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs.  Commodity cost pressures, and any increase in these costs, especially beef or chicken prices, could adversely affect future operating results.  In addition, our business is susceptible to increases in these costs as a result of other factors beyond our control, such as weather conditions, global demand, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulations.  Further, prices for feed ingredients used to produce beef, chicken and pork could be adversely affected by changes in global weather patterns, which are inherently unpredictable, and by federal ethanol policy.  Increases in gasoline prices could result in the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors, which would increase our costs.  Significant increases in expenses incurred by consumers, such as living expenses or gasoline prices, could also result in a decrease in customer traffic at our restaurants, which could adversely affect our business.  We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results.  In addition, we may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to our customers.  If any increased costs were passed to customers, demand for Wendy’s products may reduce, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our operating results.Our business could be hurt by increased labor costs or labor shortages.Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our restaurants.  We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our managers and hourly employees.  Increased labor costs due to competition, increased minimum wage or employee benefits costs (including various federal, state and local actions to increase minimum wages), unionization activity or other factors would adversely impact our cost of sales and operating expenses.  In addition, Wendy’s success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and staff and employees and key personnel at our restaurant support center, and our inability to do so could adversely affect our results of operations. 13Shortages or interruptions in the supply or distribution of perishable food products could damage the Wendy’s brand reputation and adversely affect our sales and operating results.Wendy’s and its franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet brand specifications.  Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution (including, for example, interruptions caused by labor disputes or acts of war, terrorism or nature), disease or food-borne illnesses, political unrest, inclement weather or other calamities or conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which could lower our revenues, increase operating costs, damage brand reputation and otherwise harm our business and the businesses of our franchisees.As of December 29, 2019, three independent processors (five total production facilities) supplied all of the beef used by Wendy’s U.S. restaurants and five independent processors (11 total production facilities) supplied all of the chicken used by Wendy’s U.S. restaurants.  In addition, there was one main in-line distributor of food, packaging and beverage products, excluding breads, that serviced approximately 52% of Wendy’s U.S. restaurants and five additional in-line distributors that, in the aggregate, serviced approximately 47% of Wendy’s U.S. restaurants.Wendy’s and its franchisees have not experienced any material shortages of food, equipment, fixtures or other products that are necessary to maintain restaurant operations.  Wendy’s anticipates no such shortages of products and believes that alternate suppliers and distribution sources are available.  However, if a disruption of service from any of our key suppliers or distributors was to occur, we could experience short-term increases in our costs while supply and distribution channels were adjusted, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify or negotiate with such suppliers or distributors on terms that are commercially reasonable to us.Food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness involving Wendy’s, its supply chain or other food service companies, could create negative publicity and adversely affect sales and operating results.Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to food safety matters to enable our customers to enjoy safe, quality food products.  However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. coli), have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future, including at Wendy’s restaurants.  Food safety events could adversely affect the price and availability of beef, chicken or other food products.  As a result, Wendy’s restaurants could experience a significant increase in food costs if there are food safety events, whether or not such events involve Wendy’s restaurants or restaurants of competitors.Instances or reports, whether true or not, of food-safety issues, such as food-borne illnesses, food tampering, food contamination or mislabeling, either during the growing, manufacturing, packaging, storing, distribution or preparation of products, have in the past severely injured the reputation of companies in the quick-service restaurant industry and could affect Wendy’s as well.  Any report linking the Company, Wendy’s restaurants, or our suppliers to food-borne illnesses or food tampering, contamination, mislabeling or other food-safety issues could damage the value of the Wendy’s brand immediately and severely hurt sales of Wendy’s products and possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions), or other damages.In addition, food safety events, whether or not involving Wendy’s, could result in negative publicity for Wendy’s or for the industry or market segments in which we operate.  This negative publicity, as well as any other negative publicity concerning types of food products served at Wendy’s restaurants, may reduce demand for Wendy’s food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types.  A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could result in a decline in sales and operating results at Company-operated restaurants or in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants and could materially and adversely affect our brand, results of operations and financial condition.Consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of beef, chicken, french fries or other products we sell, concerns regarding the ingredients in our products and/or the cooking processes used in our restaurants, or concerns regarding the effects of disease outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics could affect demand for our products.Consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of beef, chicken, french fries or other products we sell, concerns regarding the ingredients in our products and/or the cooking processes used in our restaurants, or concerns regarding the effects of disease outbreaks or health epidemics or pandemics could result in less demand for our products and a decline in sales at Company-operated restaurants and in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants. 14Increased use of social media could create and/or amplify the effects of negative publicity and adversely affect sales and operating results.Events reported in the media, including social media, whether or not accurate or involving Wendy’s, could create and/or amplify negative publicity for Wendy’s or for the industry or market segments in which we operate.  These and other types of social media risks could reduce demand for Wendy’s food and result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types.  A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of negative publicity created or amplified by social media could result in a decline in sales and operating results at Company-operated restaurants or in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.  Social media risks could also arise from Company or franchise employees not following defined policies for the use of social media during business operations, or actions taken by Company or franchise employees during personal activities outside of their employment, but which could still reflect negatively on the Wendy’s brand.   Growth of our restaurant business is dependent to a large extent on new restaurant openings, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.Our restaurant business derives earnings from sales at Company-operated restaurants, franchise royalties received from franchised restaurants and franchise fees from franchise restaurant operators for each new restaurant opened.  Growth in our restaurant revenues and earnings is dependent to a large extent on new restaurant openings.  Numerous factors beyond our control may affect restaurant openings, which in turn could hurt the business and operating results of Wendy’s and Wendy’s restaurants.  These factors include but are not limited to:•our ability to attract new franchisees;•the availability of site locations for new restaurants (including non-traditional locations);•the ability of potential restaurant owners to obtain financing;•the ability of restaurant owners to attract, train and retain qualified operating personnel;•construction and development costs of new restaurants, particularly in highly-competitive markets;•the ability of restaurant owners to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all; and•adverse weather conditions.In addition, Wendy’s growth strategy includes an increased focus on non-traditional development, such as fuel centers, transportation centers, food courts, military bases and delivery-only locations.  Our inability to identify suitable locations, achieve consumer acceptance or otherwise execute our non-traditional development strategy could have an adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition.  Wendy’s plans to launch breakfast across the U.S. system.  The breakfast daypart is competitive across the restaurant industry and it may prove difficult to achieve market share and reach targeted levels of breakfast sales and profits.As previously announced, Wendy’s plans to enter the breakfast daypart across the U.S. system on March 2, 2020.  The Company and franchisee leadership have worked closely to align with the U.S. system on a breakfast program that the Company believes will drive incremental sales and profits through a strong economic model.  However, previous breakfast initiatives were accompanied by competitive pressures and responses from our competitors, some of whom are well-established in the breakfast daypart, operational complexity, challenging food and labor costs, varied consumer acceptance and discretionary spending patterns that differ from other dayparts, and these factors could again impact our ability to achieve market share and reach targeted levels of breakfast sales and profits.  In addition, breakfast sales could cannibalize sales during other parts of the day and may have negative impacts on restaurant margins.  The continued active support and engagement of our franchisees is also critical for the successful launch and execution of breakfast.  The Company and its franchisees plan to hire additional crew members across the country to support the breakfast initiative.  Qualified individuals needed to fill these positions are in short supply in some geographic areas and our inability to successfully recruit, hire, train, motivate and retain qualified employees could adversely affect our operations.  The launch of breakfast will also require significant financial resources, including the Company’s plans to support the system by reinvesting royalties from breakfast sales beginning in 2020 to fund incremental marketing and advertising campaigns.  Our strategy to launch breakfast across the U.S. system may expose us to additional risks and our inability to successfully execute on our strategy could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 15Wendy’s franchisees could take actions that could harm our business.As of December 29, 2019, approximately 95% of restaurants in the Wendy’s system were operated by franchisees.  Wendy’s franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with the standards set forth in our franchise and other agreements with them.  Wendy’s also provides training and support to franchisees.  However, franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants.  Specifically, franchisees are solely responsible for developing and utilizing their own policies and procedures, making their own hiring, firing and disciplinary decisions, scheduling hours and establishing wages, and managing their day-to-day employment processes and procedures, all of which is done independent of Wendy’s and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules or regulations.  Further, franchisees have discretion as to the prices charged to customers.  As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee.  If franchisees do not successfully operate their restaurants in a manner consistent with required standards, then royalty payments to us could be adversely affected and the brand’s image and reputation could be harmed, both of which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.  In addition, the failure of franchisees to adequately engage in succession planning may affect their restaurant operations and development of new Wendy’s restaurants, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.Our success depends on franchisees’ participation in brand strategies and the ability of our system to respond and adapt to market changes.Wendy’s franchisees are an integral part of our business and growth strategy.  Wendy’s may be unable to successfully implement the strategies that we believe are necessary for future growth if franchisees do not participate in the implementation of those strategies.  Our business and operating results could be adversely affected if a significant number of franchisees do not participate in brand strategies, such as new restaurant development, Image Activation, digital commerce platforms and technologies and the launch of breakfast across the U.S. system, which in turn may harm our business and financial condition.  In addition, Wendy’s current franchise model, and the way our brand strategies are executed across the Wendy’s system, may make it difficult for the Wendy’s brand to respond and adapt to the speed of change in technology, consumer preferences, the regulatory environment or other external factors as quickly as may be required to maintain and grow market share and remain competitive.Our Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at Company-operated restaurants and franchised restaurants or improve our results of operations, and franchisees may not participate in the Image Activation program to the extent expected by the Company. Wendy’s continues to implement our Image Activation program, which includes innovative exterior and interior restaurant designs.  As of December 29, 2019, approximately 58% of Wendy’s global system restaurants were on the new image, and Wendy’s has plans for a significant number of new and reimaged Company-operated and franchisee restaurants in 2020 and beyond.      In order to support our Image Activation program and promote new restaurant development, Wendy’s has an incentive program for franchisees that provides for reductions in royalty and national advertising payments for up to the first two years of operation for qualifying new restaurants opened by December 31, 2020, with the value of the incentives declining in the later years of the program.  In addition, during 2018, Wendy’s announced a restaurant development incentive program that provides for incremental reductions in royalty and national advertising payments for up to the first two years of operation for qualifying new restaurants for existing franchisees that sign up for the program and commit to incremental development of new Wendy’s restaurants under a new development agreement.  Wendy’s also provides franchisees with the option of an early 20-year renewal of their franchise agreement upon completion of reimaging utilizing certain approved Image Activation remodel designs.The Company’s Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at Company-operated or franchised restaurants or improve results of operations.  There can be no assurance that sales at participating franchised restaurants will achieve or maintain projected levels or that after giving effect to the incentives provided to franchisees the Company’s results of operations will improve.  There can also be no assurance that franchisees will participate in the Image Activation program to the extent expected by the Company.Further, it is possible that Wendy’s may provide other financial incentives to franchisees to participate in the Image Activation program.  These incentives could also result in additional expense and/or a reduction of royalties or other revenues received from franchisees in the future.  If Wendy’s provides additional incentives to franchisees related to financing of the Image Activation program, Wendy’s may incur costs related to loan guarantees, interest rate subsidies and/or costs related to collectability of loans. 16In addition, approximately 95% of the Wendy’s system consists of franchised restaurants.  Many of our franchisees will need to borrow funds in order to participate in the Image Activation program.  Other than the incentive programs described above, Wendy’s generally does not provide franchisees with financing, although we continue to develop third-party financing sources for franchisees.  If franchisees are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, they may be unwilling or unable to invest in the reimaging of their existing restaurants and/or the development of new restaurants, and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our financial results are impacted to a large extent by the operating results of franchisees and the continued renewal of their franchise agreements.As of December 29, 2019, approximately 95% of the Wendy’s system consisted of franchised restaurants.  We receive revenues in the form of royalties and national advertising funds contributions (both of which are generally based on a percentage of sales at franchised restaurants), as well as rent and fees from franchisees.  Accordingly, a substantial portion of our financial results is to a large extent dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees.  If sales trends or economic conditions worsen for franchisees, or if the overall business or financial health of franchisees deteriorates, their operating results or financial condition may worsen and our royalty, national advertising funds, rent and other fee revenues may decline.  In addition, our accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts may increase.  When Company-operated restaurants with leased real estate are sold to franchisees, one of our subsidiaries is often required to remain responsible for lease payments for these restaurants to the extent that the purchasing franchisees default on their leases.  During periods of declining sales and profitability of franchisees, the incidence of franchisee defaults for these lease payments may increase and we may be required to make those payments and seek recourse against the franchisee or agree to repayment terms.  Additionally, if franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements, or if we decide to restructure franchise agreements to induce franchisees to renew these agreements, then our royalty revenues may decrease.  Further, we may decide from time to time to acquire restaurants from franchisees that experience significant financial hardship, which may reduce our cash and cash equivalents.Wendy’s may be unable to manage effectively the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, or successfully implement other strategic initiatives, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.Wendy’s has from time to time acquired Wendy’s restaurants from, and sold Wendy’s restaurants to, franchisees.  Wendy’s intends to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions of franchised restaurants and strategic dispositions of Company-operated restaurants to existing and new franchisees.  The success of these transactions is dependent upon many factors, such as the availability of sellers and buyers, the availability of financing, and the ability to negotiate transactions on terms deemed acceptable.  In addition, the operations of restaurants that are acquired from or sold to franchisees may not be integrated successfully, and the intended benefits of such transactions may not be realized.  Acquisitions of franchised restaurants pose various risks to Wendy’s business operations, including:•diversion of management’s attention to the integration of acquired restaurant operations;•increased operating expenses and the inability to achieve expected cost savings and operating efficiencies;•exposure to liabilities arising out of prior operations of acquired restaurants; and•the assumption of long-term, non-cancelable leases.Engaging in acquisitions and dispositions also places increased demands on Wendy’s operational and financial management resources and may require us to continue to expand these resources.  If Wendy’s is unable to manage the acquisition and disposition of restaurants effectively, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.In addition, Wendy’s from time to time evaluates and may pursue other opportunities for growth through new and existing franchise partners, joint venture investments, expansion of our brand through other opportunities and strategic mergers, acquisitions and divestitures.  These strategic initiatives involve various inherent risks, including, without limitation, general business risk, integration and synergy risk, market acceptance risk and risks associated with the potential distraction of management.  Strategic transactions may not ultimately create value for us or our stockholders and may harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 17Current restaurant locations may become unattractive, and attractive new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all.The success of any Wendy’s restaurant depends in substantial part on its location.  There can be no assurance that our current restaurant locations will continue to be attractive as demographic patterns change.  Neighborhood or economic conditions where our restaurants are located could decline in the future, resulting in potentially reduced sales in those locations.  In addition, rising real estate prices in some areas may restrict our ability and the ability of franchisees to purchase or lease new desirable locations.  If desirable locations cannot be obtained at reasonable prices, or at all, Wendy’s ability to execute our growth strategies could be adversely affected.Wendy’s leasing and ownership of significant amounts of real estate exposes it to possible liabilities and losses, including liabilities associated with environmental matters.As of December 29, 2019, Wendy’s leased or owned the land and/or the building for 357 Company-operated restaurants.  Wendy’s also owned 512 and leased 1,248 properties that were either leased or subleased principally to franchisees as of December 29, 2019.  Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate.  In particular, the value of our real property assets could decrease, and costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends, supply or demand for the ownership and operation of the restaurants (which may be impacted by competition from similar restaurants in the area) and liability for environmental matters.Wendy’s is subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances.  These environmental laws provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner, operator or occupant of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances.  Third parties may also make claims against owners, operators or occupants of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such substances.  A number of our restaurant sites were formerly gas stations or are adjacent to current or former gas stations, or were used for other commercial activities that can create environmental impacts.  We may also acquire or lease these types of sites in the future.  We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of all of our properties.  We may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our leased and owned properties, and any such liabilities identified in the future could cause us to incur significant costs, including costs associated with litigation, fines or clean-up responsibilities.  In addition, we cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted.  Further, we cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with any environmental laws or regulations or to satisfy any such claims.  See “Item 1.  Business - General - Legal and Environmental Matters” for additional information.Wendy’s leases real property generally for initial terms of 15 to 20 years with one or more options to extend the term of the leases in consecutive five-year increments.  Many leases provide that the landlord may increase the rent over the term of the lease and any renewals of the term.  Most leases require us to pay all of the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities.  We generally cannot cancel these leases prior to the expiration of their term.  If an existing or future restaurant is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term.  In addition, as each lease expires, we may fail to negotiate additional renewals or renewal options, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close restaurants in desirable locations, negatively impacting our results of operations.Due to the concentration of Wendy’s restaurants in particular geographic regions, our business results could be impacted by the adverse economic conditions prevailing in those regions.As of December 29, 2019, we and our franchisees operated Wendy’s restaurants in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and 30 foreign countries and U.S. territories.  As of December 29, 2019, the eight leading states by number of operating U.S. system restaurants were Florida, Texas, Ohio, Georgia, California, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan.  In addition, as of December 29, 2019, Company-operated restaurants were located only in Florida, Illinois, Ohio, New York, Massachusetts, Colorado and Rhode Island.  This geographic concentration can cause economic conditions or other unforeseen events in particular areas of the country to have a disproportionate impact on our overall results of operations, regardless of the state of the national economy as a whole.  It is possible that adverse economic conditions or other unforeseen events in states or regions that contain a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants (including Canada, where approximately 41% of the Company’s international restaurants were located as of December 29, 2019) could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the future. 18Our operations are influenced by adverse weather conditions.Weather, which is unpredictable, can adversely impact Wendy’s restaurant operations.  Harsh weather conditions that keep customers from dining out can result in lost sales and revenues for our restaurants.  A heavy snowstorm in the Northeast or Midwest or a hurricane in the Southeast can shut down an entire metropolitan area, resulting in a reduction in sales in that area.  Our first quarter includes winter months and historically has a lower level of sales at Company-operated restaurants.  Because a significant portion of our restaurant operating costs is fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of sales during these periods hurts our operating margins and can result in restaurant operating losses.  For these reasons, a quarter-to-quarter comparison may not be a good indication of Wendy’s performance or how we may perform in the future.Our results can be adversely affected by unforeseen events, such as natural disasters, hostilities, social unrest or other catastrophic events.Unforeseen events, such as natural disasters, hostilities (including terrorist activities and public or workplace violence), social unrest or other catastrophic events (including health epidemics or pandemics) can adversely affect consumer spending, consumer confidence levels, restaurant sales and operations and our ability to perform corporate or support functions at our restaurant support center, any of which could affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Complaints or litigation may hurt the Wendy’s brand.Wendy’s customers may file from time to time complaints or lawsuits against us or our franchisees alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to a Wendy’s restaurant, or alleging that there was a problem with food quality or operations at a Wendy’s restaurant.  We may also be subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims from franchisees, intellectual property claims, data privacy claims and claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, including class action lawsuits related to these matters.  Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management’s attention away from operations, hurt our performance and have a negative impact on the Wendy’s brand.  We believe we have adequate accruals for continuing operations for all of our legal and environmental matters, including the accrual that we recorded for the legal proceedings related to a cybersecurity incident as described in Note 23 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein.  See Note 11 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for further information on the accrual.  We cannot estimate the aggregate possible range of loss for our existing litigation and claims due to most proceedings being in preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur, and significant factual matters unresolved.  In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties.  Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions are thus inherently difficult.  Insurance policies contain customary limitations, conditions and exclusions that can affect the amount of insurance proceeds ultimately received.  A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.  Further, adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt us and our franchisees.Additionally, the restaurant industry has been subject to a number of claims alleging that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have contributed to the obesity or otherwise adversely impacted the health of certain of their customers.  Adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may harm the reputation of our restaurants, even if the allegations are not directed against our restaurants or are not valid, and even if we are not found liable or the concerns relate only to a single restaurant or a limited number of restaurants.  Moreover, complaints, litigation or adverse publicity experienced by one or more of Wendy’s franchisees could also hurt our business as a whole.We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of the Wendy’s brand and hurt our business.Our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business.  We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and other intellectual property.  The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both existing and new markets.  If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, or if any third party misappropriates, infringes, dilutes or otherwise violates our intellectual property, the value of our brand may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the failure of our brand to achieve and maintain market acceptance.  This could harm our image, brand or competitive position and, if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, cause us to incur significant legal fees and diversion of resources.  Also, if we do not attempt or  19are unable to successfully protect, maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights, there could be a material adverse effect on our business as a result of, among other things, consumer confusion, dilution of the Wendy’s brand or increased competition from unauthorized users of our brand, each of which may result in decreased revenues to affected restaurants. We franchise the Wendy’s brand to various franchisees.  While we try to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by all of our franchisees, we cannot ensure that franchisees will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property or the reputation of the Wendy’s brand or restaurant system.We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the United States and selected foreign jurisdictions.  Not all of the trademarks that are used in the Wendy’s system have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business or may do business in the future, and some trademarks will never be registered in all of these countries.  Rights in trademarks are generally national in character, and are obtained on a country-by-country basis by the first person to obtain protection through use or registration in that country in connection with specific products or services.  Some countries’ laws do not protect unregistered trademarks at all, or make them more difficult to enforce, and third parties have filed, or may in the future file, for “Wendy’s” or similar marks.  Accordingly, we may not be able to adequately protect the Wendy’s brand everywhere in the world and use of the Wendy’s brand may result in liability for trademark infringement, trademark dilution or unfair competition.  In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.  We cannot ensure that all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate.  In addition, we cannot ensure that third parties will not bring infringement claims against us in the future.  Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, cause delays in introducing new menu items, require costly modifications to advertising and promotional materials, harm the Wendy’s brand, our image, competitive position or ability to expand our operations into other jurisdictions and/or cause us to incur significant costs related to defense or settlement  require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.  As a result, any such claim could harm our business and cause a decline in our results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, third parties may assert that certain of our intellectual property, or our rights therein, are invalid or unenforceable.  If our rights in any of our intellectual property were found to infringe third-party rights, or portions thereof were deemed invalid or unenforceable, we may be forced to defend or resolve related claims and to absorb related expenses.  In addition, such loss of rights could permit competing uses of such intellectual property which, in turn, could also harm our business and cause a decline in our results of operations and financial condition.Our current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims that have been or may be filed.We currently maintain insurance we believe to be adequate for businesses of our size and type.  However, there are types of losses we could encounter that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters or acts of terrorism. In addition, we currently self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under workers’ compensation, general liability and property insurance programs.  Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs, which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.The Company currently maintains insurance coverage to address cyber incidents.  Applicable insurance policies contain customary limitations, conditions and exclusions.  There can be no assurance that the policies covering cyber incidents maintained by the Company will cover substantially all of the Company’s costs and expenses incurred related to previous or future cybersecurity incidents.Our success depends in part upon the continued succession and retention of certain key personnel and the effectiveness of our leadership structure.We believe that over time our success has been dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management team.  Our failure to retain members of our senior management team in the future could adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts we have undertaken to increase the efficiency and profitability of our business.  In addition, changes to our leadership and organizational structure can be inherently difficult to manage and if the Company is unable to implement any such changes effectively, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. 20Changes in legal or regulatory requirements, including licensing approvals, franchising laws, payment card industry rules, overtime rules, minimum wage rates, tax legislation, federal ethanol policy, data privacy laws and accounting standards, as well as an increasing focus on environmental, social and governance issues, may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results, including our ability to open new restaurants.Each Wendy’s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, safety and other agencies in the state and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located, as well as to federal laws, rules and regulations and requirements of non-governmental entities such as payment card industry rules.  State and local government authorities may enact laws, rules or regulations that impact restaurant operations and the cost of conducting those operations.  There can be no assurance that we and our franchisees will not experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants, which could delay the opening of such restaurants in the future.  In addition, more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to tax, zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.Federal laws, rules and regulations address many aspects of our business, such as franchising, federal ethanol policy, minimum wages and taxes.  We and our franchisees are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, along with the ADA, family leave mandates and a variety of other state laws that govern these and other employment law matters.  Changes in laws, rules, regulations and governmental policies could increase our costs and adversely affect our existing and future operations and results.  The same consequences may result should any law, rule, regulation, governmental policy or applicable judicial decision declare that Wendy’s is a joint employer with our franchisees.  The failure of our digital platforms and technologies to comply with applicable laws and regulations (including, without limitation, ADA accessibility guidelines and various state, federal and international data privacy laws and regulations) could have an adverse impact on our brand, results of operations and financial condition.Changes in accounting standards, or in the interpretation of existing standards, applicable to us could also affect our future results.  See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 herein for a summary of new or amended accounting standards applicable to us.Additionally, we are working to manage the risks and costs to us, our franchisees and our supply chain of the effects of climate change, greenhouse gases, and diminishing energy and water resources.  These risks include the increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters, such as packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use.  These risks also include the increased pressure to make commitments, set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them.  These risks could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks.  If we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our complex regulatory environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.We do not exercise ultimate control over purchasing for our restaurant system, which could harm sales or profitability and the brand.Although we seek to ensure that all suppliers to the Wendy’s system meet quality control standards, Wendy’s franchisees control the purchasing of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies from such suppliers through QSCC, Wendy’s independent purchasing co-op.  QSCC manages, for the Wendy’s system in the U.S. and Canada, contracts for the purchase and distribution of food, proprietary paper, operating supplies and equipment under national agreements with pricing based on total system volume.  We are entitled to appoint two representatives (of the total of 11) on the board of directors of QSCC and participate in QSCC through our Company-operated restaurants, but we do not control the decisions and activities of QSCC except to require that all suppliers satisfy our quality control standards.  If QSCC does not properly estimate the product needs of the Wendy’s system, makes poor purchasing decisions or decides to cease its operations, or if our relationship with QSCC is terminated for any reason, system sales, operating costs and our supply chain management could be adversely affected and the results of operations and financial condition of the Company and franchisees could be negatively impacted. 21Our international operations are subject to various factors of uncertainty and there is no assurance that international operations will be profitable.In addition to many of the risk factors described throughout this Item 1A, Wendy’s business outside of the United States is subject to a number of additional factors, including international economic and political conditions, risk of corruption and violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws of other countries, the inability to adapt to differing cultures or consumer preferences, inadequate brand infrastructure within foreign countries to support our international activities, inability to obtain adequate supplies meeting our quality standards and product specifications or interruptions in obtaining such supplies, restrictions on our ability to move cash out of certain foreign countries, currency regulations and fluctuations, diverse government regulations and tax systems, uncertain or differing interpretations of rights and obligations in connection with international franchise agreements, the collection of royalties and other fees from international franchisees, the inability to protect technology, data or intellectual property rights, compliance with international privacy and information security laws and regulations, the availability and cost of land, construction costs, other legal, financial or regulatory impediments to the development and/or operation of new restaurants and the inability to identify, attract and retain experienced management, qualified franchisees and joint venture partners.  Although we believe we have developed the support structure required for international growth, there is no assurance that such growth will occur or that international operations will be profitable.  In addition, to the extent we invest in international Company-operated restaurants or joint ventures, we would also have the risk of operating losses related to those restaurants, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  See Note 8 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for information regarding certain operating losses related to our international operations. Wendy’s planned expansion into the United Kingdom and other European markets may present increased risks due to low brand awareness, geopolitical risks and other factors.As previously announced, Wendy’s intends to open Company-operated restaurants in the United Kingdom and, if successful, plans to expand into other anchor markets in Europe utilizing a franchise model.  New markets, such as the United Kingdom, may have low brand awareness as well as competitive conditions, consumer tastes, discretionary spending patterns and social and cultural differences that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets.  We may need to make greater investments than we originally planned in advertising and promotional activity to build brand awareness, which could negatively impact the profitability of our operations.  In addition, we may be unable to obtain desirable locations for new restaurants at reasonable prices, or at all, and restaurants may have higher construction, occupancy, food and labor costs than we currently anticipate.  Geopolitical risks, including the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union through a negotiated exit over a period of time, may result in increased regulatory complexities and economic uncertainty.  Any of these risks and uncertainties, and other factors we cannot anticipate, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.There are risks associated with our increasing dependence on digital commerce platforms and technologies to maintain and grow sales, and we cannot predict the impact that these digital commerce platforms and technologies, other new or improved technologies or alternative methods of delivery may have on consumer behavior and our financial results. Advances in technologies, including advances in digital food order and delivery technologies, and changes in consumer behavior driven by such advances could have a negative effect on our business.  Technology and consumer offerings continue to develop, and we expect that new and enhanced technologies and consumer offerings will be available in the future, including those with a focus on restaurant modernization, restaurant technology and digital engagement and ordering.  We may pursue certain of those technologies and consumer offerings if we believe they offer a sustainable guest proposition and can be successfully integrated into our business model.  However, we cannot predict consumer acceptance of these digital platforms, delivery channels or systems or other technologies or their impact on our business.  In addition, our competitors, some of whom have greater resources than we do, may be able to benefit from changes in technologies or consumer acceptance of such changes, which could harm our competitive position and the Wendy’s brand.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully respond to changing consumer preferences, including with respect to new technologies, or to effectively adjust our product mix, service offerings and marketing initiatives for products and services that address, and anticipate advances in, technology and market trends.  If we are not able to successfully respond to these challenges, our business, financial condition, and operating results and the Wendy’s brand could be adversely affected.In addition, we anticipate that consumers will continue to have more options to place orders digitally, both domestically and internationally.  Our failure to adequately invest in new technology or adapt to technological developments and industry trends, particularly with respect to digital commerce capabilities, could result in a loss of customers and related market share.  If Wendy’s digital commerce platforms do not meet customers’ expectations in terms of security, speed, attractiveness or ease of use, customers may be less inclined to return to such digital commerce platforms, which could negatively impact our sales, results of operations and financial condition. 22We are heavily dependent on computer systems and information technology and any material failure, misuse, interruption or security breach of our computer systems, technology or social media platforms could adversely affect our business.We are significantly dependent upon our computer systems and information technology to properly conduct our business, including point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures.  Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems and information technology.  The failure of these systems and information technology to operate effectively, an interruption in such systems or technology, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems, fraudulent manipulation of sales reporting from our franchised restaurants resulting in loss of sales and royalty payments, or a breach in security of these systems could be harmful and cause delays in customer service, result in the loss of data, reduce efficiency or cause delays in operations.  Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any problems.  Additionally, the success of certain of our strategic initiatives, including to expand our consumer-facing digital capabilities to connect with customers and drive growth, is highly dependent on our technology systems.  Any security breach involving our or our franchisees’ point-of-sale or other systems could result in a loss of consumer confidence and potential costs associated with fraud.  Also, despite our considerable efforts and technological resources to secure our computer systems and information technology, security breaches, such as unauthorized access and computer viruses, may occur, resulting in system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  A security breach of our computer systems or information technology could require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity or a loss in consumer confidence, sales and profits or cause us to incur penalties or other costs that could adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations.As part of our marketing efforts, we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain customers.  These efforts may not be successful, and could pose a variety of other risks, including the improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about the Wendy’s brand, the exposure of personally identifiable information, the failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations or fraud.  The inappropriate use of social media vehicles by franchisees, customers or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage the brand’s reputation.  The occurrence of any such developments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.In addition, as previously announced, we have implemented a plan to realign and reinvest resources in our IT organization to strengthen its ability to accelerate growth.  We are partnering with a third-party global IT consultant on this new structure to leverage their global capabilities and enable a more seamless integration between our digital and corporate IT assets.  Under the new structure, we are dependent to a significant extent on our ongoing relationship and engagement with the consultant, including their personnel and resources, technological expertise and ability to help execute our digital and restaurant and enterprise technology initiatives.  Risks associated with our IT realignment plan, including the ultimate costs incurred in connection with such plan, could have an adverse impact on our restaurant operations and support, results of operations and financial condition.The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in cybersecurity, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise of confidential information and/or damage to our employee and business relationships, all of which could subject us to loss and harm the Wendy’s brand.A cyber incident includes any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information resources.  More specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack or unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information about customers, franchisees, vendors and employees.  A number of retailers and other companies have recently experienced serious cyber incidents and breaches of their information technology systems.  In 2015 and 2016, certain of our franchisees experienced cybersecurity incidents, as further described below.  As the Company’s reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to its systems, both internal and those managed by third parties.  Three primary risks that could result from a cyber incident include operational interruption, damage to our relationship with customers, franchisees and employees and exposure of private data.  In addition to maintaining insurance coverage to address cyber incidents, the Company has also implemented processes, procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks.  However, these measures, as well as the increased awareness of a risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that the Company’s reputation and financial results will not be adversely affected by such an incident.Because the Company and its franchisees accept electronic forms of payment from customers, the Company’s business requires the collection and retention of customer data, including credit and debit card numbers and other personally identifiable information, in various information systems that the Company and its franchisees maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom the Company and its franchisees contract to provide credit card processing and related services.  The Company also maintains important internal Company data, such as personally identifiable information about its employees and franchisees and information relating to its operations.  The Company’s use of personally identifiable information is regulated by international, federal and state laws, as well as by certain third-party agreements.  As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, the Company  23may incur additional costs to ensure that it remains in compliance with those laws and regulations.  If the Company’s security and information systems are compromised or if its employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws, regulations, or contract terms, and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect the Company’s reputation, disrupt its operations and result in costly litigation, judgments, or penalties resulting from violation of applicable laws and payment card industry regulations.  A cyber incident could also require the Company to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, increase fees payable to third parties and cause the Company to incur penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect the operation of the Company’s business and results of operations.Certain of our franchisees have experienced cybersecurity incidents.In February 2016, the Company reported unusual payment card activity affecting some franchise-owned restaurants and that malware had been discovered on certain systems.  In June 2016, the Company reported that an additional malware variant had been identified and disabled.  In July 2016, the Company, on behalf of affected franchise locations, provided information about specific restaurant locations that may have been impacted by these attacks, all of which are located in the United States, along with support for customers who may have been affected by the malware.As a result of the cybersecurity incidents, the Company was named as a defendant in a putative class action filed in the United States on behalf of consumers, as well as in five class actions brought by financial institutions in the United States that were subsequently consolidated into a single proceeding.  In addition, certain of the Company’s present and former directors, and one non-director executive officer of the Company, were named as defendants in putative shareholder derivative complaints, which have been consolidated into one action, alleging breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment and gross mismanagement.  These civil proceedings sought damages and other relief allegedly arising from the cybersecurity incidents.  On February 26, 2019, the court granted final approval of the settlement of the consumer class action, and on November 6, 2019, the court granted final approval of the settlement of the financial institutions class action.  Both matters are now considered fully paid and closed.  On January 24, 2020, the court granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement of the putative shareholder derivative action.  These and any other claims or investigations related to the cybersecurity incidents may adversely affect how we or our franchisees operate the business, divert the attention of management from the operation of the business, have an adverse effect on our reputation, result in additional costs and adversely affect our results of operations.We may be required to recognize additional asset impairment and other asset-related charges.We have significant amounts of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets and have incurred impairment charges in the past with respect to those assets.  In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we test for impairment generally annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment, such as:•significant adverse changes in the business climate;•current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with long-lived assets;•a current expectation that more-likely-than-not (i.e., a likelihood that is more than 50%) long-lived assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life; and•a significant drop in our stock price.Based upon future economic and capital market conditions, as well as the operating performance of our business, future impairment charges could be incurred.  Further, as a result of our system optimization initiative, the Company has recorded losses on remeasuring long-lived assets to fair value upon determination that the assets will be leased and/or subleased to franchisees in connection with the sale or anticipated sale of Company-operated restaurants, and the Company may incur further losses as the Company sells additional restaurants from time to time.The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions, and substantially all of the assets of certain subsidiaries are security, under the terms of a securitized financing facility.Wendy’s Funding, LLC, a limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, is the master issuer (the “Master Issuer”) of outstanding senior secured notes under a securitized financing facility entered into in June 2015.  Under the facility, the Master Issuer issued the following currently outstanding series of notes: (i) Series 2019-1 3.783% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I, with an initial principal amount of $400.0 million; (ii) Series 2019-1 4.080% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II, with an initial principal amount of $450.0 million; (iii) Series 2018-1 3.573% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I, with an initial principal amount of $450.0 million; (iv) Series 2018-1 3.884% Fixed Rate Senior  24Secured Notes, Class A-2-II, with an initial principal amount of $475.0 million; and (v) Series 2015-1 4.497% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-III, with an initial principal amount of $500.0 million (collectively, the “Class A-2 Notes”).  The Master Issuer also issued outstanding Series 2019-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1, which allows for the borrowing of up to $150.0 million from time to time on a revolving basis (the “Class A-1 Notes” and, together with the Class A-2 Notes, the “Senior Notes”).   The Senior Notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Master Issuer and certain other limited-purpose, bankruptcy remote, wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company that act as guarantors (collectively, the “Securitization Entities”), except for certain real estate assets and subject to certain limitations as set forth in the indenture governing the Senior Notes (the “Indenture”) and the related guarantee and collateral agreement.  The assets of the Securitization Entities include most of the domestic and certain of the foreign revenue-generating assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, which principally consist of franchise-related agreements, certain Company-operated restaurants, intellectual property and license agreements for the use of intellectual property.The Senior Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including (i) that the Master Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Senior Notes, (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments under certain circumstances, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the assets pledged as collateral for the Senior Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters.  The Senior Notes are also subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service coverage ratios, the sum of global gross sales for specified restaurants being below certain levels on certain measurement dates, certain manager termination events, an event of default, and the failure to repay or refinance on the applicable scheduled maturity date.  The Senior Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal, or other amounts due on or with respect to the Senior Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective, and certain judgments.In the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the Indenture (including, without limitation, upon an event of default under the Indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the applicable term), the funds available to the Company would be reduced or eliminated, which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business. In addition, the Indenture and the related management agreement contain various covenants that limit the Company and its subsidiaries’ ability to engage in specified types of transactions, subject to certain exceptions, including, for example, to (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, (ii) sell certain assets, (iii) create or incur liens on certain assets to secure indebtedness or (iv) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets.  As a result of these restrictions, the Company may not have adequate resources or flexibility to continue to manage the business and provide for growth of the Wendy’s system, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future growth prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.The Company has a significant amount of debt outstanding.  Such indebtedness, along with the other contractual commitments of our subsidiaries, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to meet debt payment obligations.As of December 29, 2019, the Company had approximately $2.3 billion of outstanding debt on its balance sheet.  Additionally, a subsidiary of the Company has issued the Class A-1 Notes, which allows for the borrowing of up to $150.0 million from time to time on a revolving basis.This level of debt could have significant consequences on the Company’s future operations, including:•making it more difficult to meet payment and other obligations under outstanding debt;•resulting in an event of default if the Company’s subsidiaries fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of the Company’s subsidiaries’ debt becoming immediately due and payable;•reducing the availability of the Company’s cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, equity and debt repurchases, dividends, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; 25•subjecting the Company to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on indebtedness with variable interest rates;•limiting the Company’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to, and increasing its vulnerability to, changes in the Company’s business, the industry in which it operates and the general economy; and•placing the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that are less leveraged.Further, the Class A-1 Notes may accrue interest based on the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”), which is expected to be discontinued after 2021.  If LIBOR is discontinued, we may need to renegotiate certain loan documents and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our lenders or the resulting impact on our interest expense.The ability of Wendy’s to make payments on, repay or refinance its debt, and any additional debt, and to fund planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend largely upon its future operating performance and ability to generate significant cash flows.  Future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.  In addition, the ability of Wendy’s to borrow funds in the future to make payments on its debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in the securitized financing facility and other debt agreements, and other agreements it may enter into in the future.  Specifically, Wendy’s will need to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests.  There can be no assurance that the Company’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the Company’s securitized financing facility or other debt agreements or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable the Company to pay its debt or to fund its dividend and other liquidity needs.  If the Company’s subsidiaries are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations, they may need to refinance or restructure debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital.  If the Company’s subsidiaries are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, they may not be able to meet debt payment and other obligations.In addition, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries also have significant contractual requirements for the purchase of soft drinks.  If consumer preferences change and the Company’s customers purchase fewer soft drinks than expected or estimated, such contractual commitments may adversely affect the financial condition of the Company.  The Company has also provided loan guarantees to various lenders on behalf of franchisees entering into debt arrangements for new restaurant development and equipment financing.  Certain subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have been indemnified.  In addition, certain subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees.  These commitments, guarantees and other liabilities could have an adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity and the ability of its subsidiaries to meet payment obligations.The Company may incur additional indebtedness, guarantees, commitments or other liabilities in the future.  If new debt, guarantees, commitments or other liabilities are added to the Company’s current consolidated debt levels, the related risks that the Company now faces could be amplified.There can be no assurance regarding whether or to what extent the Company will pay dividends on its common stock in the future.Holders of the Company’s common stock will only be entitled to receive such dividends as the Company’s Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments.  Any dividends will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the Company’s earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time.  In addition, because the Company is a holding company, its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent upon cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand and cash flows from its subsidiaries.  The ability of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends to the holding company is dependent upon their ability to achieve sufficient cash flows after satisfying their respective cash requirements, including the requirements and restrictions under the Company’s securitized financing facility and other debt agreements.  26A substantial amount of the Company’s common stock is concentrated in the hands of certain stockholders.Nelson Peltz, the Company’s Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, Peter May, the Company’s Vice Chairman and former President and Chief Operating Officer, and Edward Garden, a former director of the Company, beneficially own shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock that collectively constitute approximately 19% of its total voting power as of February 18, 2020.  Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden may, from time to time, acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of common stock.On December 1, 2011, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Trian Agreement”) with Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden, and several of their affiliates (the “Covered Persons”).  Pursuant to the Trian Agreement, the Board of Directors, including a majority of the independent directors, approved, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“Section 203”), the Covered Persons becoming the owners (as defined in Section 203(c)(9) of the DGCL) of or acquiring an aggregate of up to (and including), but not more than, 32.5% (subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Agreement) of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, such that no such persons would be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 203 solely as a result of such ownership.  Certain other provisions of the Trian Agreement terminated when the Covered Persons’ beneficial ownership of the Company’s common stock decreased to less than 25% of the outstanding voting power of the Company in January 2014.This concentration of ownership gives Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden significant influence over the outcome of actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets.  They are also in a position to have significant influence to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.  If in the future Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden were to acquire more than a majority of the Company’s outstanding voting power, they would be able to determine the outcome of the election of members of the Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring majority stockholder approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets.  They would also be in a position to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.The Company’s certificate of incorporation contains certain anti-takeover provisions and permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and limits our ability to raise capital from affiliates.Certain provisions in the Company’s certificate of incorporation are intended to discourage or delay a hostile takeover of control of the Company.  The Company’s certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of “blank check” preferred stock, which will have such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.  Accordingly, the Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of its common stock.  The preferred stock could be used to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that is determined by the Board of Directors to be undesirable.  Although the Company has no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock, it cannot assure that it will not do so in the future.The Company’s certificate of incorporation prohibits the issuance of preferred stock to affiliates, unless offered ratably to the holders of the Company’s common stock, subject to an exception in the event that the Company is in financial distress and the issuance is approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  This prohibition limits the ability to raise capital from affiliates"
6,WEN,WENDY'S CO,2019-02-27,"Risk Factors
.We wish to caution readers that in addition to the important factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we have included below the most significant factors that have affected, or in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results during fiscal 2019, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.Our success depends in part upon the continued succession and retention of certain key personnel.We believe that over time our success has been dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management team.  The failure by us to retain members of our senior management team in the future could adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts we have undertaken to increase the efficiency and profitability of our business.During 2018, the Company and Chief Information Officer David G. Trimm completed an effective succession process in connection with Mr. Trimm’s retirement from the Company.  Mr. Trimm transitioned his restaurant technology responsibilities to Robert D. Wright, Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, his enterprise technology responsibilities to Gunther Plosch, Chief Financial Officer, and his digital technology responsibilities to Laura Titas, Chief Digital Experience Officer.  Ms. Titas joined the Company in December 2018 and serves on the Company’s senior leadership team, reporting to Kurt A. Kane, Executive Vice President and Chief Concept and Marketing Officer.Competition from other restaurant companies, as well as grocery chains and other retail food outlets, or poor customer experience at Wendy’s restaurants, could hurt our brand.The market segments in which Company-operated and franchised Wendy’s restaurants compete are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, price, food quality and presentation, service, location, convenience, and the nature and condition of the restaurant facility.  If customers have a poor experience at a Wendy’s restaurant, whether at a Company-operated or franchised restaurant, we may experience a decrease in guest traffic.  Further, Wendy’s restaurants compete with a variety of locally-owned restaurants, as well as competitive regional and national chains and franchises.  Several of these chains compete by offering menu items that are targeted at certain consumer groups or dietary trends.  Additionally, many of our competitors have introduced lower cost, value meal menu options, and have employed marketing strategies that include frequent use of price discounting (including through the use of coupons and other offers), frequent promotions and heavy advertising expenditures.  Our revenues and those of our franchisees may be hurt by this product and price competition.Moreover, new companies, including operators outside the quick-service restaurant industry, may enter our market areas and target our customer base.  For example, additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases have come from deli sections and in-store cafes of a number of major grocery store chains, as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets.  Such competitors may have, among other things, lower operating costs, better locations, better facilities, better management, better products, more effective marketing and more efficient operations.  Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing and marketing strategies in the quick-service restaurant industry better than we can.  Many of our competitors spend significantly more on advertising and marketing than we do, which may give them a competitive advantage through higher levels of brand awareness among consumers.  Wendy’s also competes with grocery chains and other retail outlets which sell food that will be prepared at home.  Competition with these chains and other outlets has increased as the gap between the price of food at home compared to the price of food purchased at restaurants has widened.  This increased product and price competition could put deflationary pressure on the selling price of products offered at Wendy’s restaurants.All such competition may adversely affect our revenues and profits by reducing revenues of Company-operated restaurants and royalty revenue from franchised restaurants.Changes in consumer tastes and preferences, and in discretionary consumer spending, could result in a decline in sales at Company-operated restaurants and in the royalties that we receive from franchisees.The quick-service restaurant industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions, discretionary spending priorities, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants.  Our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income.  Accordingly, we may experience declines in sales during economic downturns.  Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending or a decline in consumer food-away-from- 12home spending could hurt our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.  If Company-operated and franchised restaurants are unable to adapt to changes in consumer preferences and trends, Company-operated and franchised restaurants may lose customers and the resulting revenues from Company-operated restaurants and the royalties that we receive from franchisees may decline.Disruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.Disruptions in the national and global economies could result in higher unemployment rates and declines in consumer confidence and spending.  If such disruptions occur, they may result in significant declines in consumer food-away-from-home spending and customer traffic in our restaurants and those of our franchisees.  There can be no assurance that government responses to economic disruptions will restore consumer confidence.  Ongoing disruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.Changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken, pork, cheese and grains), supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations.Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken, pork, cheese and grains), supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs.  Commodity cost pressures, and any increase in these costs, especially beef or chicken prices, could adversely affect future operating results.  In addition, our business is susceptible to increases in these costs as a result of other factors beyond our control, such as weather conditions, global demand, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulations.  Further, prices for feed ingredients used to produce beef, chicken and pork could be adversely affected by changes in global weather patterns, which are inherently unpredictable, and by federal ethanol policy.  Increases in gasoline prices could result in the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors, which would increase our costs.  Significant increases in expenses incurred by consumers, such as living expenses or gasoline prices, could also result in a decrease in customer traffic at our restaurants, which could adversely affect our business.  We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results.  In addition, we may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to our customers.Shortages or interruptions in the supply or distribution of perishable food products could damage the Wendy’s brand reputation and adversely affect our sales and operating results.Wendy’s and its franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet brand specifications.  Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, disease or food-borne illnesses, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which could lower our revenues, increase operating costs, damage brand reputation and otherwise harm our business and the businesses of our franchisees.As of December 30, 2018, four independent processors (five total production facilities) supplied all of Wendy’s beef in the United States and six independent processors (12 total production facilities) supplied all of Wendy’s chicken in the United States. In addition, Wendy’s had one main in-line distributor of food, packaging and beverage products, excluding produce and breads, that serviced approximately 41% of its Company-operated and franchised restaurants and six additional in-line distributors that, in the aggregate, serviced approximately 55% of its Company-operated and franchised restaurants.  Wendy’s and its franchisees have not experienced any material shortages of food, equipment, fixtures or other products that are necessary to maintain restaurant operations.  Wendy’s anticipates no such shortages of products and believes that alternate suppliers and distribution sources are available.  However, if a disruption of service from any of our key suppliers or distributors was to occur, we could experience short-term increases in our costs while supply and distribution channels were adjusted, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify or negotiate with such suppliers or distributors on terms that are commercially reasonable to us. 13Food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. coli) involving Wendy’s, its supply chain or other food service companies, could create negative publicity and adversely affect sales and operating results.Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe, quality food products.  However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. coli), have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future.  Food safety events could adversely affect the price and availability of beef, chicken or other food products.  As a result, Wendy’s restaurants could experience a significant increase in food costs if there are food safety events, whether or not such events involve Wendy’s restaurants or restaurants of competitors.In addition, food safety events, whether or not involving Wendy’s, could result in negative publicity for Wendy’s or for the industry or market segments in which we operate.  This negative publicity, as well as any other negative publicity concerning types of food products Wendy’s serves, may reduce demand for Wendy’s food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types.  A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could result in a decline in sales and operating results at Company-operated restaurants or in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.Consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of beef, chicken, french fries or other products we sell, concerns regarding the ingredients in our products and/or the cooking processes used in our restaurants, or concerns regarding the effects of disease outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics could affect demand for our products.Consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of beef, chicken, french fries or other products we sell, concerns regarding the ingredients in our products and/or the cooking processes used in our restaurants, or concerns regarding the effects of disease outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics could result in less demand for our products and a decline in sales at Company-operated restaurants and in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.Increased use of social media could create and/or amplify the effects of negative publicity and adversely affect sales and operating results.Events reported in the media, including social media, whether or not accurate or involving Wendy’s, could create and/or amplify negative publicity for Wendy’s or for the industry or market segments in which we operate.  These and other types of social media risks could reduce demand for Wendy’s food and result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types.  A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of negative publicity created or amplified by social media could result in a decline in sales and operating results at Company-operated restaurants or in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.  Social media risks could also arise from Company or franchise employees not following defined policies for the use of social media during business operations, or actions taken by Company or franchise employees during personal activities outside of their employment, but which could still reflect negatively on the Wendy’s brand.   Growth of our restaurant business is dependent to a large extent on new restaurant openings, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.Our restaurant business derives earnings from sales at Company-operated restaurants, franchise royalties received from franchised restaurants and franchise fees from franchise restaurant operators for each new unit opened.  Growth in our restaurant revenues and earnings is dependent to a large extent on new restaurant openings.  Numerous factors beyond our control may affect restaurant openings.  These factors include but are not limited to:•our ability to attract new franchisees;•the availability of site locations for new restaurants;•the ability of potential restaurant owners to obtain financing;•the ability of restaurant owners to hire, train and retain qualified operating personnel;•construction and development costs of new restaurants, particularly in highly-competitive markets;•the ability of restaurant owners to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all; and•adverse weather conditions. 14Wendy’s franchisees could take actions that could harm our business.As of December 30, 2018, approximately 95% of restaurants in the Wendy’s system were operated by franchisees.  Wendy’s franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with the standards set forth in our franchise and other agreements with them.  Wendy’s also provides training and support to franchisees.  However, franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants.  Specifically, franchisees are solely responsible for developing and utilizing their own policies and procedures, making their own hiring, firing and disciplinary decisions, scheduling hours and establishing wages, and managing their day-to-day employment processes and procedures, all of which is done independent of Wendy’s and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules or regulations.  Further, franchisees have discretion as to the prices charged to customers.  As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee.  If franchisees do not successfully operate their restaurants in a manner consistent with required standards, then royalty payments to us could be adversely affected and the brand’s image and reputation could be harmed, both of which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.  In addition, the failure of franchisees to adequately engage in succession planning may affect their restaurant operations and development of new Wendy’s restaurants, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.Our success depends on franchisees’ participation in brand strategies and the ability of our system to respond and adapt to market changes.Wendy’s franchisees are an integral part of our business.  Wendy’s may be unable to successfully implement the strategies that we believe are necessary for future growth if franchisees do not participate in the implementation of those strategies.  Our business and operating results could be adversely affected if a significant number of franchisees do not participate in brand strategies, such as new restaurant development, Image Activation and digital commerce platforms and technologies.  In addition, Wendy’s current franchise model, and the way our brand strategies are executed across the Wendy’s system, may make it difficult for the Wendy’s brand to respond and adapt to the speed of change in technology, consumer preferences, the regulatory environment or other external factors as quickly as may be required to maintain and grow market share and remain competitive. Our Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at Company-operated restaurants and franchised restaurants or improve our results of operations, and franchisees may not participate in the Image Activation program to the extent expected by the Company.The Company and its franchisees reimaged 401 North America system restaurants and built 159 global restaurants in 2018.  As of December 30, 2018, the global Wendy’s system had 50% of restaurants on the new image.  The Company has plans for significantly more new and reimaged Company and franchisee restaurants in 2019 and beyond.      In order to promote new restaurant development, Wendy’s has an incentive program for franchisees that provides for reductions in royalty and national advertising payments for up to the first two years of operation for qualifying new restaurants opened by December 31, 2020, with the value of the incentives declining in the later years of the program.  In August 2018, Wendy’s announced a new restaurant development incentive program that provides for incremental reductions in royalty and national advertising payments for up to the first two years of operation for qualifying new restaurants for existing franchisees that sign up for the program and commit to incremental development of new Wendy’s restaurants under a new development agreement by July 1, 2019.  Wendy’s also provides franchisees with the option of an early 20-year renewal of their franchise agreement upon completion of reimaging utilizing certain approved Image Activation remodel designs.The Company’s Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at Company-operated restaurants or improve our results of operations.  There can be no assurance that sales at participating franchised restaurants will achieve or maintain projected levels or that after giving effect to the incentives provided to franchisees the Company’s results of operations will improve.  There can also be no assurance that franchisees will participate in the Image Activation program to the extent expected by the Company.Further, it is possible that Wendy’s may provide other financial incentives to franchisees to participate in the Image Activation program.  These incentives could also result in additional expense and/or a reduction in royalties or other revenues received from franchisees in the future.  If Wendy’s provides additional incentives to franchisees related to financing of the Image Activation program, Wendy’s may incur costs related to loan guarantees, interest rate subsidies and/or costs related to collectability of loans.In addition, approximately 95% of the Wendy’s system consists of franchised restaurants.  Many of our franchisees will need to borrow funds in order to participate in the Image Activation program.  Other than the incentive programs described above, Wendy’s generally does not provide franchisees with financing, although we continue to develop third-party financing sources for franchisees.  If franchisees are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, they may be unwilling or  15unable to invest in the reimaging of their existing restaurants and/or the development of new restaurants, and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our financial results are impacted to a large extent by the operating results of franchisees.As of December 30, 2018, approximately 95% of the Wendy’s system consisted of franchised restaurants.  We receive revenues in the form of royalties and national advertising funds contributions (both of which are generally based on a percentage of sales at franchised restaurants), as well as rent and fees from franchisees.  Accordingly, a substantial portion of our financial results is to a large extent dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees.  If sales trends or economic conditions worsen for franchisees, their financial results may worsen and our royalty, national advertising funds, rent and other fee revenues may decline.  In addition, our accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts may increase.  When Company-operated restaurants with leased real estate are sold to franchisees, one of our subsidiaries is often required to remain responsible for lease payments for these restaurants to the extent that the purchasing franchisees default on their leases.  During periods of declining sales and profitability of franchisees, the incidence of franchisee defaults for these lease payments may increase and we may be required to make those payments and seek recourse against the franchisee or agree to repayment terms.  Additionally, if franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements, or if we decide to restructure franchise agreements to induce franchisees to renew these agreements, then our royalty revenues may decrease.  Further, we may decide from time to time to acquire restaurants from franchisees that experience significant financial hardship, which may reduce our cash and cash equivalents.Wendy’s may be unable to manage effectively the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, or successfully implement other strategic initiatives, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.Wendy’s has from time to time acquired Wendy’s restaurants from, and sold Wendy’s restaurants to, franchisees.  Wendy’s will continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions of franchised restaurants and strategic dispositions of Company-operated restaurants to existing and new franchisees.  The success of these transactions is dependent upon many factors, such as the availability of sellers and buyers, the availability of financing, and the ability to negotiate transactions on terms deemed acceptable.  In addition, the operations of restaurants that are acquired from or sold to franchisees may not be integrated successfully, and the intended benefits of such transactions may not be realized.  Acquisitions of franchised restaurants pose various risks to Wendy’s business operations, including:•diversion of management’s attention to the integration of acquired restaurant operations;•increased operating expenses and the inability to achieve expected cost savings and operating efficiencies;•exposure to liabilities arising out of prior operations of acquired restaurants; and•the assumption of long-term, non-cancelable leases.Engaging in acquisitions and dispositions also places increased demands on Wendy’s operational and financial management resources and may require us to continue to expand these resources.  If Wendy’s is unable to manage the acquisition and disposition of restaurants effectively, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.In addition, Wendy’s from time to time evaluates and may pursue other opportunities for growth through new and existing franchise partners, joint venture investments, expansion of our brand through other opportunities and strategic mergers, acquisitions and divestitures.  These strategic initiatives involve various inherent risks, including, without limitation, general business risk, integration and synergy risk, market acceptance risk and risks associated with the potential distraction of management.  Strategic transactions may not ultimately create value for us or our stockholders and may harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Current restaurant locations may become unattractive, and attractive new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all.The success of any restaurant depends in substantial part on its location.  There can be no assurance that our current restaurant locations will continue to be attractive as demographic patterns change.  Neighborhood or economic conditions where our restaurants are located could decline in the future, resulting in potentially reduced sales in those locations.  In addition, rising real estate prices in some areas may restrict our ability and the ability of franchisees to purchase or lease new desirable locations.  If desirable locations cannot be obtained at reasonable prices, or at all, Wendy’s ability to execute our growth strategies could be adversely affected. 16Wendy’s leasing and ownership of significant amounts of real estate exposes it to possible liabilities and losses, including liabilities associated with environmental matters.As of December 30, 2018, Wendy’s leased or owned the land and/or the building for 353 Company-operated Wendy’s restaurants.  Wendy’s also owned 516 and leased 1,279 properties that were either leased or subleased principally to franchisees as of December 30, 2018.  Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate.  In particular, the value of our real property assets could decrease, and costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends, supply or demand for the ownership and operation of the restaurants (which may be impacted by competition from similar restaurants in the area) and liability for environmental matters.Wendy’s is subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances.  These environmental laws provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner, operator or occupant of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances.  Third parties may also make claims against owners, operators or occupants of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such substances.  A number of our restaurant sites were formerly gas stations or are adjacent to current or former gas stations, or were used for other commercial activities that can create environmental impacts.  We may also acquire or lease these types of sites in the future.  We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of all of our properties.  We may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our leased and owned properties, and any such liabilities identified in the future could cause us to incur significant costs, including costs associated with litigation, fines or clean-up responsibilities.  In addition, we cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted.  We cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with any environmental laws or regulations or to satisfy any such claims.  See “Item 1. Business - General - Legal and Environmental Matters” for additional information.Wendy’s leases real property generally for initial terms of 15 to 20 years with one or more options to extend the term of the leases in consecutive five-year increments.  Many leases provide that the landlord may increase the rent over the term of the lease and any renewals of the term.  Most leases require us to pay all of the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities.  We generally cannot cancel these leases prior to the expiration of their term.  If an existing or future restaurant is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term.  In addition, as each lease expires, we may fail to negotiate additional renewals or renewal options, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close restaurants in desirable locations.Due to the concentration of Wendy’s restaurants in particular geographic regions, our business results could be impacted by the adverse economic conditions prevailing in those regions.As of December 30, 2018, we and our franchisees operated Wendy’s restaurants in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and 31 foreign countries and territories.  As of December 30, 2018 and as detailed in “Item 2. Properties,” the eight leading states by number of operating units were:  Florida, Ohio, Texas, Georgia, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Michigan.  This geographic concentration can cause economic conditions in particular areas of the country to have a disproportionate impact on our overall results of operations, regardless of the state of the national economy as a whole.  It is possible that adverse economic conditions in states or regions that contain a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the future.Our operations are influenced by adverse weather conditions.Weather, which is unpredictable, can adversely impact Wendy’s restaurant operations.  Harsh weather conditions that keep customers from dining out can result in lost sales and revenues for our restaurants.  A heavy snowstorm in the Northeast or Midwest or a hurricane in the Southeast can shut down an entire metropolitan area, resulting in a reduction in sales in that area.  Our first quarter includes winter months and historically has a lower level of sales at Company-operated restaurants.  Because a significant portion of our restaurant operating costs is fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of sales during these periods hurts our operating margins and can result in restaurant operating losses.  For these reasons, a quarter-to-quarter comparison may not be a good indication of Wendy’s performance or how we may perform in the future. 17Our business could be hurt by increased labor costs or labor shortages.Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our restaurants.  We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our managers and hourly employees.  Increased labor costs due to competition, increased minimum wage or employee benefits costs (including various federal, state and local actions to increase minimum wages), unionization activity or other factors would adversely impact our cost of sales and operating expenses.  In addition, Wendy’s success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and staff, and our inability to do so could adversely affect our results of operations.Complaints or litigation may hurt the Wendy’s brand.Wendy’s customers from time to time file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to a Wendy’s restaurant, or alleging that there was a problem with food quality or operations at a Wendy’s restaurant.  We are also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims from franchisees and claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, including class action lawsuits related to these matters.  Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management’s attention away from operations and hurt our performance.  We believe we have adequate accruals for continuing operations for all of our legal and environmental matters, including the accrual that we recorded for the legal proceedings related to a cybersecurity incident as described in Note 23 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein.  See Note 11 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data contained in Item 8 herein for further information on the accrual.  We cannot estimate the aggregate possible range of loss due to most proceedings being in preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur, and significant factual matters unresolved.  In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties.  Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions are thus inherently difficult.  Insurance policies contain customary limitations, conditions and exclusions that can affect the amount of insurance proceeds ultimately received.  A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.  Further, adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt us and our franchisees.Additionally, the restaurant industry has been subject to a number of claims alleging that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have contributed to the obesity or otherwise adversely impacted the health of certain of their customers.  Adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may harm the reputation of our restaurants, even if the allegations are not directed against our restaurants or are not valid, and even if we are not found liable or the concerns relate only to a single restaurant or a limited number of restaurants.  Moreover, complaints, litigation or adverse publicity experienced by one or more of Wendy’s franchisees could also hurt our business as a whole.We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of the Wendy’s brand and hurt our business.Our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business.  We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and other intellectual property.  The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both existing and new markets.  If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property, the value of our brand may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the failure of our brand to achieve and maintain market acceptance.  This could harm our image, brand or competitive position and, if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, cause us to incur significant legal fees.We franchise the Wendy’s brand to various franchisees.  While we try to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by all of our franchisees, we cannot ensure that franchisees will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property or the reputation of the Wendy’s brand or restaurant system.We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions.  The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the United States in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries.  We cannot ensure that all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate.  The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. 18In addition, we cannot ensure that third parties will not bring infringement claims against us in the future.  Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause delays in introducing new menu items, require costly modifications to advertising and promotional materials or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.  As a result, any such claim could harm our business and cause a decline in our results of operations and financial condition.Our current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims that have been or may be filed.We currently maintain insurance we believe is adequate for businesses of our size and type.  However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters or acts of terrorism. In addition, we currently self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under workers’ compensation, general liability and property insurance programs.  Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs, which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.The Company currently maintains insurance coverage to address cyber incidents.  Applicable insurance policies contain customary limitations, conditions and exclusions.  There can be no assurance that the cyber policies maintained by the Company will cover substantially all of the Company’s costs and expenses incurred related to previous or future cybersecurity incidents, including those described below in this Item 1A and in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 herein.Changes in legal or regulatory requirements, including licensing approvals, franchising laws, payment card industry rules, overtime rules, minimum wage rates, tax legislation, federal ethanol policy and accounting standards, may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results, including our ability to open new restaurants.Each Wendy’s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, safety and other agencies in the state and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located, as well as to federal laws, rules and regulations and requirements of non-governmental entities such as payment card industry rules.  State and local government authorities may enact laws, rules or regulations that impact restaurant operations and the cost of conducting those operations.  There can be no assurance that we and/or our franchisees will not experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants, which could delay the opening of such restaurants in the future.  In addition, more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to tax, zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.Federal laws, rules and regulations address many aspects of our business, such as franchising, federal ethanol policy, minimum wages and taxes.  We and our franchisees are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, along with the ADA, family leave mandates and a variety of other state laws that govern these and other employment law matters.  Changes in laws, rules, regulations and governmental policies, including the joint employer standard, could increase our costs and adversely affect our existing and future operations and results.Changes in accounting standards, or in the interpretation of existing standards, applicable to us could also affect our future results.  See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 herein for a summary of new or amended accounting standards applicable to us.We do not exercise ultimate control over purchasing for our restaurant system, which could harm sales or profitability and the brand.Although we seek to ensure that all suppliers to the Wendy’s system meet quality control standards, Wendy’s franchisees control the purchasing of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies from such suppliers through QSCC, Wendy’s independent purchasing co-op.  QSCC manages, for the Wendy’s system in the U.S. and Canada, contracts for the purchase and distribution of food, proprietary paper, operating supplies and equipment under national agreements with pricing based upon total system volume.  We are entitled to appoint two representatives (of the total of 11) on the board of directors of QSCC and participate in QSCC through our Company-operated restaurants, but we do not control the decisions and activities of QSCC except to require that all suppliers satisfy our quality control standards.  If QSCC does not properly estimate the product needs of the Wendy’s system, makes poor purchasing decisions or decides to cease its operations, system sales and operating costs could be adversely affected and the results of operations and financial condition of the Company and franchisees could be negatively impacted. 19Our international operations are subject to various factors of uncertainty and there is no assurance that international operations will be profitable.In addition to many of the risk factors described throughout this Item 1A, Wendy’s business outside of the United States is subject to a number of additional factors, including international economic and political conditions, risk of corruption and violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws of other countries, the inability to adapt to differing cultures or consumer preferences, inadequate brand infrastructure within foreign countries to support our international activities, inability to obtain adequate supplies meeting our quality standards and product specifications or interruptions in obtaining such supplies, restrictions on our ability to move cash out of certain foreign countries, currency regulations and fluctuations, diverse government regulations and tax systems, uncertain or differing interpretations of rights and obligations in connection with international franchise agreements, the collection of royalties and other fees from international franchisees, the inability to protect intellectual property rights, compliance with international privacy and information security laws and regulations, the availability and cost of land, construction costs, other legal, financial or regulatory impediments to the development and/or operation of new restaurants and the inability to identify, attract and retain experienced management, qualified franchisees and joint venture partners.  Although we believe we have developed the support structure required for international growth, there is no assurance that such growth will occur or that international operations will be profitable.  In addition, to the extent we invest in international Company-operated restaurants or joint ventures, we would also have the risk of operating losses related to those restaurants, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.There are risks associated with our increasing dependence on digital commerce platforms and technologies to maintain and grow sales, and we cannot predict the impact that these digital commerce platforms and technologies, other new or improved technologies or alternative methods of delivery may have on consumer behavior and our financial results. Advances in technologies and changes in consumer behavior driven by such advances could have a negative effect on our business.  Technology and consumer offerings continue to develop, and we expect that new and enhanced technologies and consumer offerings will be available in the future, including those with a focus on restaurant modernization, restaurant technology and digital engagement and ordering. We may pursue certain of those technologies and consumer offerings if we believe they offer a sustainable guest proposition and can be successfully integrated into our business model. However, we cannot predict consumer acceptance of these digital platforms, delivery channels or other technologies or their impact on our business. In addition, our competitors, some of whom have greater resources than us, may be able to benefit from changes in technologies or consumer acceptance of such changes, which could harm our competitive position. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully respond to changing consumer preferences, including with respect to new technologies, or to effectively adjust our product mix, service offerings and marketing initiatives for products and services that address, and anticipate advances in, technology and market trends. If we are not able to successfully respond to these challenges, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be adversely affected.In addition, we anticipate that consumers will continue to have more options to place orders digitally, both domestically and internationally. Our failure to adequately invest in new technology or adapt to technological developments and industry trends, particularly with respect to digital commerce capabilities, could result in a loss of customers and related market share.  If Wendy’s digital commerce platforms do not meet customers’ expectations in terms of security, speed, attractiveness or ease of use, customers may be less inclined to return to such digital commerce platforms, which could negatively impact our sales, results of operations and financial condition. 20We are heavily dependent on computer systems and information technology and any material failure, misuse, interruption or security breach of our computer systems, technology or social media platforms could adversely affect our business.We are significantly dependent upon our computer systems and information technology to properly conduct our business, including point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures.  Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems and information technology.  The failure of these systems and information technology to operate effectively, an interruption in such systems or technology, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems, fraudulent manipulation of sales reporting from our franchised restaurants resulting in loss of sales and royalty payments, or a breach in security of these systems could be harmful and cause delays in customer service, result in the loss of data, reduce efficiency or cause delays in operations.  Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any problems.  Additionally, the success of certain of our strategic initiatives, including to expand our consumer-facing digital capabilities to connect with customers and drive growth, is highly dependent on our technology systems.  Any security breach involving our or our franchisees’ point-of-sale or other systems could result in a loss of consumer confidence and potential costs associated with fraud.  Also, despite our considerable efforts and technological resources to secure our computer systems and information technology, security breaches, such as unauthorized access and computer viruses, may occur, resulting in system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  A security breach of our computer systems or information technology could require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity or a loss in consumer confidence, sales and profits or cause us to incur penalties or other costs that could adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations.As part of our marketing efforts, we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain customers.  These efforts may not be successful, and could pose a variety of other risks, including the improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about the Wendy’s brand, exposure of personally identifiable information or fraud.  The inappropriate use of social media vehicles by franchisees, customers or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage the brand’s reputation.  The occurrence of any such developments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in cybersecurity, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise of confidential information and/or damage to our employee and business relationships, all of which could subject us to loss and harm the Wendy’s brand.A cyber incident includes any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information resources.  More specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack or unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information about customers, franchisees, vendors and employees.  A number of retailers and other companies have recently experienced serious cyber incidents and breaches of their information technology systems.  The Wendy’s system has also experienced unusual payment card activity at certain franchised restaurants, as further described below.  As the Company’s reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to its systems, both internal and those managed by third parties.  Three primary risks that could result from a cyber incident include operational interruption, damage to our relationship with customers, franchisees and employees and exposure of private data.  In addition to maintaining insurance coverage to address cyber incidents, the Company has also implemented processes, procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks.  However, these measures, as well as the increased awareness of a risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that the Company’s reputation and financial results will not be adversely affected by such an incident.Because the Company and its franchisees accept electronic forms of payment from customers, the Company’s business requires the collection and retention of customer data, including credit and debit card numbers and other personally identifiable information, in various information systems that the Company and its franchisees maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom the Company and its franchisees contract to provide credit card processing and related services.  The Company also maintains important internal Company data, such as personally identifiable information about its employees and franchisees and information relating to its operations.  The Company’s use of personally identifiable information is regulated by international, federal and state laws, as well as by certain third-party agreements.  As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, the Company may incur additional costs to ensure that it remains in compliance with those laws and regulations.  If the Company’s security and information systems are compromised or if its employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws, regulations, or contract terms, and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect the Company’s reputation, disrupt its operations and result in costly litigation, judgments, or penalties resulting from violation of applicable laws and payment card industry regulations.  A cyber incident could also require the Company to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, increase fees payable to third parties and cause the Company to incur penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect the operation of the Company’s business and results of operations. 21Certain of our franchisees have experienced cybersecurity incidents.The Company first reported unusual payment card activity affecting some franchise-owned restaurants in February 2016 and that malware had been discovered on certain systems.  Subsequently, on June 9, 2016, the Company reported that an additional malware variant had been identified and disabled.  On July 7, 2016, the Company, on behalf of affected franchise locations, provided information about specific restaurant locations that may have been impacted by these attacks, all of which are located in the United States, along with support for customers who may have been affected by the malware variants.Working closely with third-party forensic experts, federal law enforcement and payment card industry contacts as part of its investigation, the Company determined that specific payment card information was targeted by the additional malware variant.  This information included cardholder name, credit or debit card number, expiration date, cardholder verification value and service code.  The Company believes the criminal cyberattacks resulted from service providers’ remote access credentials being compromised, allowing access, and the ability to deploy malware, to some franchisees’ point-of-sale systems.  There has been no indication in the investigation that any Company-operated restaurants were impacted by this activity.  The Company worked with investigators to disable the malware involved in the first attack in 2016.  Soon after detecting the malware variant involved in the subsequent attack, the Company identified a method of disabling it and thereafter disabled it in all franchisee restaurants where it was discovered.  The investigation confirmed that criminals used malware believed to have been effectively deployed on some Wendy’s franchisee systems starting in late fall 2015.The Company has been named as a defendant in a putative class action filed in the United States on behalf of customers, as well as five class actions brought by financial institutions in the United States that have been consolidated into a single proceeding.  In addition, certain of the Company’s present and former directors, and one non-director executive officer of the Company, were named as defendants in putative shareholder derivative complaints, which have been consolidated into one action, alleging breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment and gross mismanagement.  These civil proceedings seek damages and other relief allegedly arising from the cybersecurity incident.  In addition, claims may also be made by payment card networks against the affected franchisees.  These claims and investigations may adversely affect how we or our franchisees operate the business, divert the attention of management from the operation of the business, have an adverse effect on our reputation, result in additional costs and adversely affect our results of operations.We may be required to recognize additional asset impairment and other asset-related charges.We have significant amounts of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets and have incurred impairment charges in the past with respect to those assets.  In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we test for impairment generally annually, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment, such as:•significant adverse changes in the business climate;•current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with long-lived assets;•a current expectation that more-likely-than-not (i.e., a likelihood that is more than 50%) long-lived assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life; and•a significant drop in our stock price.Based upon future economic and capital market conditions, as well as the operating performance of our business, future impairment charges could be incurred.  Further, as a result of our system optimization initiative, the Company has recorded losses on remeasuring long-lived assets to fair value upon determination that the assets will be leased and/or subleased to franchisees in connection with the sale or anticipated sale of Company-operated restaurants, and the Company may incur further losses as the Company sells additional restaurants from time to time.The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions, and substantially all of the assets of certain subsidiaries are security, under the terms of a securitized financing facility.On January 17, 2018, Wendy’s Funding, LLC (the “Master Issuer”), a limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, completed a refinancing transaction under which the Master Issuer issued Series 2018-1 3.573% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I (the “Series 2018-1 Class A-2-I Notes”) with an initial principal amount of $450.0 million and Series 2018-1 3.884% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II (the “Series 2018-1 Class A-2-II Notes”) with an initial principal amount of $475.0 million (collectively, the “Series 2018-1 Class A-2 Notes”).  Interest payments on the Series 2018-1 Class A-2 Notes are payable on a quarterly basis.  The net proceeds from the sale of the Series 2018-1 Class A-2  22Notes were used to redeem the Master Issuer’s outstanding Series 2015-1 Class A-2-I Notes, to pay prepayment and transaction costs, and for general corporate purposes.Concurrently, the Master Issuer entered into a revolving financing facility of Series 2018-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 (the “Series 2018-1 Class A-1 Notes” and, together with the Series 2018-1 Class A-2 Notes, the “Series 2018-1 Senior Notes”), which allows for the drawing of up to $150.0 million under the Series 2018-1 Class A-1 Notes using various credit instruments, including a letter of credit facility.  The Series 2015-1 Class A-1 Notes were canceled on the closing date and the letters of credit outstanding against the Series 2015-1 Class A-1 Notes were transferred to the Series 2018-1 Class A-1 Notes.  The Company had no outstanding borrowings under its Series 2018-1 Class A-1 Notes as of December 30, 2018. In addition to the Series 2018-1 Senior Notes, the Master Issuer also has outstanding the Series 2015-1 4.080% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II with an initial principal amount of $900.0 million (the “Class A-2-II Notes”) and the Series 2015-1 4.497% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-III with an initial principal amount of $500.0 million (the “Class A-2-III Notes”) (collectively, the “remaining Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes”) that were issued on June 1, 2015.  The Series 2018-1 Senior Notes and the remaining Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes are collectively the “Senior Notes.”The Senior Notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Master Issuer and certain other limited-purpose, bankruptcy remote, wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company that act as guarantors (collectively, the “Securitization Entities”), except for certain real estate assets and subject to certain limitations as set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture (as amended and supplemented) and the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement.  The assets of the Securitization Entities include most of the domestic and certain of the foreign revenue-generating assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, which principally consist of franchise-related agreements, certain Company-operated restaurants, intellectual property and license agreements for the use of intellectual property.The Senior Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including (i) that the Master Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Senior Notes, (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments under certain circumstances, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the assets pledged as collateral for the Senior Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters.  The Senior Notes are also subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service coverage ratios, the sum of global gross sales for specified restaurants being below certain levels on certain measurement dates, certain manager termination events, an event of default, and the failure to repay or refinance on the applicable scheduled maturity date.  The Senior Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal, or other amounts due on or with respect to the Senior Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective, and certain judgments.In the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the Indenture (including, without limitation, upon an event of default under the Indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the applicable term), the funds available to the Company would be reduced or eliminated, which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business.  If the Company’s subsidiaries are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations, they may need to refinance or restructure debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital.  If the Company’s subsidiaries are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, they may not be able to meet debt payment and other obligations.The Company has a significant amount of debt outstanding. Such indebtedness, along with the other contractual commitments of our subsidiaries, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to meet debt payment obligations.As of December 30, 2018, the Company had approximately $2.8 billion of outstanding debt on its balance sheet.  Additionally, a subsidiary of the Company has issued the Series 2018-1 Class A-1 Notes, which allows the subsidiary to borrow amounts from time to time on a revolving basis, up to an aggregate principal amount of $150.0 million.This level of debt could have significant consequences on the Company’s future operations, including:•making it more difficult to meet payment and other obligations under outstanding debt; 23•resulting in an event of default if the Company’s subsidiaries fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of the Company’s subsidiaries’ debt becoming immediately due and payable;•reducing the availability of the Company’s cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;•subjecting the Company to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on indebtedness with variable interest rates;•limiting the Company’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to, and increasing its vulnerability to, changes in the Company’s business, the industry in which it operates and the general economy; and•placing the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that are less leveraged.In addition, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries also have significant contractual requirements for the purchase of soft drinks.  If consumer preferences change and the Company’s customers purchase fewer soft drinks than expected or estimated, such contractual commitments may adversely affect the financial condition of the Company.  The Company has also provided loan guarantees to various lenders on behalf of franchisees entering into debt arrangements for new restaurant development and equipment financing.  Certain subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have been indemnified.  In addition, certain subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have not been indemnified.  These commitments could have an adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity and the ability of its subsidiaries to meet payment obligations.The ability to meet payment and other obligations under the debt instruments of the Company’s subsidiaries depends on their ability to generate significant cash flows in the future.  This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond the Company’s control.  There can be no assurance that the Company’s business will generate cash flows from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to the Company under existing or any future credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable its subsidiaries to meet their debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs.  If the Company’s subsidiaries are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations, they may need to refinance or restructure debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital.  If the Company’s subsidiaries are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, they may not be able to meet debt payment and other obligations.In addition, the Company may incur additional indebtedness in the future.  If new debt or other liabilities are added to the Company’s current consolidated debt levels, the related risks that the Company now faces could be amplified.The securitized financing facility imposes certain restrictions on the activities of the Company and its subsidiaries.The Senior Notes Indenture and the management agreement entered into between a subsidiary of the Company and the Indenture trustee (the “Management Agreement”) contain various covenants that limit the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to engage in specified types of transactions.  For example, the Indenture and the Management Agreement contain covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of certain subsidiaries to:•incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;•sell certain assets;•create or incur liens on certain assets to secure indebtedness; or•consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets.As a result of these restrictions, the Company may not have adequate resources or flexibility to continue to manage the business and provide for growth of the Wendy’s system, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future growth prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 24To service debt and meet its other cash needs, the Company will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be generated by its business or available under its existing debt agreements or other sources.The ability of Wendy’s to make payments on, repay or refinance its debt, and any additional debt, and to fund planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend largely upon its future operating performance.  Future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.  In addition, the ability of Wendy’s to borrow funds in the future to make payments on its debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in the securitized financing facility and other debt agreements, and other agreements it may enter into in the future.  Specifically, Wendy’s will need to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests.  There is no assurance that the Wendy’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the Company’s securitized financing facility or other debt agreements or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable the Company to pay its debt or to fund its dividend and other liquidity needs.There can be no assurance regarding whether or to what extent the Company will pay dividends on its common stock in the future.Holders of the Company’s common stock will only be entitled to receive such dividends as the Company’s Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments.  Any dividends will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the Company’s earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time.Because the Company is a holding company, its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent upon cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand and cash flows from its subsidiaries.  The ability of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends and/or make loans or advances to the holding company will be dependent upon their respective abilities to achieve sufficient cash flows after satisfying their respective cash requirements, including the securitized financing facility and other debt agreements, to enable the payment of such dividends or the making of such loans or advances.  The ability of any of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or other payments to the Company will also be limited by restrictions in debt instruments currently existing or subsequently entered into by such subsidiaries, which is described earlier in this Item 1A.A substantial amount of the Company’s common stock is concentrated in the hands of certain stockholders.Nelson Peltz, the Company’s Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, Peter May, the Company’s Vice Chairman and former President and Chief Operating Officer, and Edward Garden, a former director of the Company, beneficially own shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock that collectively constitute approximately 20% of its total voting power as of February 19, 2019.  Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden may, from time to time, acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of common stock.On December 1, 2011, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Trian Agreement”) with Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden, and several of their affiliates (the “Covered Persons”).  Pursuant to the Trian Agreement, the Board of Directors, including a majority of the independent directors, approved, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“Section 203”), the Covered Persons becoming the owners (as defined in Section 203(c)(9) of the DGCL) of or acquiring an aggregate of up to (and including), but not more than, 32.5% (subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Agreement) of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, such that no such persons would be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 203 solely as a result of such ownership.  Certain other provisions of the Trian Agreement terminated when the Covered Persons’ beneficial ownership of the Company’s common stock decreased to less than 25% of the outstanding voting power of the Company in January 2014.This concentration of ownership gives Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden significant influence over the outcome of actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets.  They are also in a position to have significant influence to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.  If in the future Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden were to acquire more than a majority of the Company’s outstanding voting power, they would be able to determine the outcome of the election of members of the Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring majority stockholder approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets.  They would also be in a position to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company. 25The Company’s certificate of incorporation contains certain anti-takeover provisions and permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and limits our ability to raise capital from affiliates.Certain provisions in the Company’s certificate of incorporation are intended to discourage or delay a hostile takeover of control of the Company.  The Company’s certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of “blank check” preferred stock, which will have such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.  Accordingly, the Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of its common stock.  The preferred stock could be used to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that is determined by the Board of Directors to be undesirable.  Although the Company has no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock, it cannot assure that it will not do so in the future.The Company’s certificate of incorporation prohibits the issuance of preferred stock to affiliates, unless offered ratably to the holders of the Company’s common stock, subject to an exception in the event that the Company is in financial distress and the issuance is approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  This prohibition limits the ability to raise capital from affiliates"
13,WEN,WENDY'S CO,2018-02-28,"Risk Factors
.We wish to caution readers that in addition to the important factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we have included below the most significant factors that have affected, or in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results during fiscal 2018, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.Our success depends in part upon the continued succession and retention of certain key personnel.On October, 6, 2017, the Company announced that Chief People Officer Scott Weisberg intended to leave the Company once he had completed an effective succession process.  Mr. Weisberg has transitioned his responsibilities to Coley O’Brien, who had been Vice President of Human Resources.  Mr. O’Brien will become Chief People Officer effective March 1, 2018 and join the senior leadership team reporting to President and Chief Executive Officer Todd Penegor.We believe that over time our success has been dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management team.  The failure by us to retain members of our senior management team in the future could adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts we have undertaken to increase the efficiency and profitability of our business.Competition from other restaurant companies as well as grocery chains and other retail food outlets, or poor customer experience at Wendy’s restaurants, could hurt our brand.The market segments in which Company-operated and franchised Wendy’s restaurants compete are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, price, food quality and presentation, service, location, convenience, and the nature and condition of the restaurant facility.  If customers have a poor experience at a Wendy’s restaurant, whether at a Company-operated or franchised restaurant, we may experience a decrease in guest traffic.  Further, Wendy’s restaurants compete with a variety of locally-owned restaurants, as well as competitive regional and national chains and franchises.  Several of these chains compete by offering menu items that are targeted at certain consumer groups or dietary trends.  Additionally, many of our competitors have introduced lower cost, value meal menu options.  Our revenues and those of our franchisees may be hurt by this product and price competition.Moreover, new companies, including operators outside the quick-service restaurant industry, may enter our market areas and target our customer base.  For example, additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases have come from deli sections and in-store cafes of a number of major grocery store chains, as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets.  Such competitors may have, among other things, lower operating costs, better locations, better facilities, better management, better products, more effective marketing and more efficient operations.  Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing and marketing strategies in the quick-service restaurant industry better than we can.  Many of our competitors spend significantly more on advertising and marketing than we do, which may give them a competitive advantage through higher levels of brand awareness among consumers.  Wendy’s also competes with grocery chains and other retail outlets which sell food that will be prepared at home.  Competition with these chains and other outlets has increased as the gap between the price of food at home compared to food purchased at restaurants has widened. 12All such competition may adversely affect our revenues and profits by reducing revenues of Company-operated restaurants and royalty revenue from franchised restaurants.Changes in consumer tastes and preferences, and in discretionary consumer spending, could result in a decline in sales at Company-operated restaurants and in the royalties that we receive from franchisees.The quick-service restaurant industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions, discretionary spending priorities, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants.  Our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income.  Accordingly, we may experience declines in sales during economic downturns.  Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending or a decline in consumer food-away-from-home spending could hurt our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.If Company-operated and franchised restaurants are unable to adapt to changes in consumer preferences and trends, Company-operated and franchised restaurants may lose customers and the resulting revenues from Company-operated restaurants and the royalties that we receive from franchisees may decline.Disruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.Disruptions in the national and global economies could result in higher unemployment rates and declines in consumer confidence and spending.  If such disruptions occur, they may result in significant declines in consumer food-away-from-home spending and customer traffic in our restaurants and those of our franchisees.  There can be no assurance that government responses to the disruptions will restore consumer confidence.  Ongoing disruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.Changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken, pork, cheese and grains), supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs could harm results of operations.Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken, pork, cheese and grains), supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs.  Commodity cost pressures, and any increase in these costs, especially beef or chicken prices, could adversely affect future operating results.  In addition, our business is susceptible to increases in these costs as a result of other factors beyond our control, such as weather conditions, global demand, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulations.  Further, prices for feed ingredients used to produce beef, chicken and pork could be adversely affected by changes in global weather patterns, which are inherently unpredictable, and by federal ethanol policy.  Increases in gasoline prices could result in the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors, which would increase our costs.  Significant increases in expenses incurred by consumers, such as living expenses or gasoline prices, could also result in a decrease in customer traffic at our restaurants, which could adversely affect our business.  We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results.  In addition, we may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to our customers.Shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of perishable food products could damage the Wendy’s brand reputation and adversely affect our sales and operating results.Wendy’s and its franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet brand specifications.  Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, disease or food-borne illnesses, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which could lower our revenues, increase operating costs, damage brand reputation and otherwise harm our business and the businesses of our franchisees.Food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. Coli) involving Wendy’s, its supply chain or other food service companies, could create negative publicity and adversely affect sales and operating results.Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe, quality food products.  However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. Coli), have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future. 13Food safety events could adversely affect the price and availability of beef, poultry or other meats.  As a result, Wendy’s restaurants could experience a significant increase in food costs if there are food safety events whether or not such events involve Wendy’s restaurants or restaurants of competitors.In addition, food safety events, whether or not involving Wendy’s, could result in negative publicity for Wendy’s or for the industry or market segments in which we operate.  Increased use of social media could create and/or amplify the effects of negative publicity.  This negative publicity, as well as any other negative publicity concerning types of food products Wendy’s serves, may reduce demand for Wendy’s food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types.  A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could result in a decline in sales and operating results at Company-operated restaurants or in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.Consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of beef, poultry, french fries or other products we sell, concerns regarding the ingredients in our products and/or cooking processes used in our restaurants, or concerns regarding the effects of disease outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics could affect demand for our products.Consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of beef, poultry, french fries or other products we sell, concerns regarding the ingredients in our products and/or cooking processes used in our restaurants, or concerns regarding the effects of disease outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics could result in less demand for our products and a decline in sales at Company-operated restaurants and in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.Increased use of social media could create and/or amplify the effects of negative publicity and adversely affect sales and operating results.Events reported in the media, including social media, whether or not accurate or involving Wendy’s, could create and/or amplify negative publicity for Wendy’s or for the industry or market segments in which we operate.  This could reduce demand for Wendy’s food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types.  A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of negative publicity from social media could result in a decline in sales and operating results at Company-operated restaurants or in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.Growth of our restaurant business is dependent on new restaurant openings, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.Our restaurant business derives earnings from sales at Company-operated restaurants, franchise royalties received from franchised restaurants and franchise fees from franchise restaurant operators for each new unit opened.  Growth in our restaurant revenues and earnings is dependent on new restaurant openings.  Numerous factors beyond our control may affect restaurant openings.  These factors include but are not limited to:•our ability to attract new franchisees;•the availability of site locations for new restaurants;•the ability of potential restaurant owners to obtain financing;•the ability of restaurant owners to hire, train and retain qualified operating personnel;•construction and development costs of new restaurants, particularly in highly-competitive markets;•the ability of restaurant owners to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all; and•adverse weather conditions. 14Wendy’s franchisees could take actions that could harm our business.As of December 31, 2017, approximately 95% of restaurants in the Wendy’s system were operated by franchisees.  Wendy’s franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with the standards set forth in agreements with them.  Wendy’s also provides training and support to franchisees.  However, franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and the franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants.  Specifically, franchisees are solely responsible for developing and utilizing their own policies, procedures and documents, making their own hiring, firing and disciplinary decisions, scheduling hours and establishing wages, and managing their day-to-day employment processes and procedures, all of which is done independent of Wendy’s and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules or regulations.  Further, franchisees have discretion as to the prices charged to customers.  As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee.  If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with required standards, then royalty payments to us could be adversely affected and the brand’s image and reputation could be harmed, both of which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.In addition, the failure of franchisees to adequately engage in succession planning may affect their restaurant operations and development of new Wendy’s restaurants, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.Our success depends on franchisees’ participation in brand strategies.Wendy’s franchisees are an integral part of our business.  Wendy’s may be unable to successfully implement the strategies that it believes are necessary for further growth if franchisees do not participate in that implementation.  Our business and operating results could be adversely affected if a significant number of franchisees do not participate in brand strategies.Our Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at Company-operated and participating franchised restaurants or improve our results of operations, and franchisees may not participate in the Image Activation program to the extent expected by the Company.The Company and its franchisees reimaged 551 North America system restaurants and built 174 global restaurants in 2017.  As of December 31, 2017, the global Wendy’s system had 43% of restaurants on the new image.  The Company has plans for significantly more new and reimaged Company and franchisee restaurants in 2018 and beyond.In order to promote Image Activation new restaurant development, Wendy’s has an incentive program for franchisees that provides for reductions in royalty and national advertising payments for up to the first two years of operation for qualifying new restaurants opened by December 31, 2020, with the value of the incentives declining in the later years of the program.  Wendy’s also had incentive programs for 2017 available to franchisees that commenced Image Activation restaurant remodels by December 15, 2017.  The remodel incentive programs provide for reductions in royalty payments for one year after the completion of construction.The Company’s Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at Company-operated restaurants or improve results of operations.  There can be no assurance that sales at participating franchised restaurants will achieve or maintain projected levels or that after giving effect to the incentives provided to franchisees the Company’s results of operations will improve.  There can also be no assurance that franchisees will participate in the Image Activation program to the extent expected by the Company.Further, it is possible that Wendy’s may provide other financial incentives to franchisees to participate in the Image Activation program.  These incentives could also result in additional expense and/or a reduction of royalties or other revenues received from franchisees in the future.  If Wendy’s provides additional incentives to franchisees related to financing of the Image Activation program, Wendy’s may incur costs related to loan guarantees, interest rate subsidies and/or costs related to collectability of loans.In addition, most of the Wendy’s system consists of franchised restaurants.  Many of our franchisees will need to borrow funds in order to participate in the Image Activation program.  Other than the incentive programs described above, Wendy’s generally does not provide franchisees with financing but it continues to develop third-party financing sources for franchisees.  If our franchisees are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or not at all, they may be unwilling or unable to invest in the reimaging of their existing restaurants and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected. 15Our financial results are affected by the operating results of franchisees.As of December 31, 2017, approximately 95% of the Wendy’s system were franchise restaurants.  We receive revenue in the form of royalties, which are generally based on a percentage of sales at franchised restaurants, rent and fees from franchisees.  Accordingly, a substantial portion of our financial results is to a large extent dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees.  If sales trends or economic conditions worsen for franchisees, their financial results may worsen and our royalty, rent and other fee revenues may decline.  In addition, accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts may increase.  When Company-operated restaurants are sold, one of our subsidiaries is often required to remain responsible for lease payments for these restaurants to the extent that the purchasing franchisees default on their leases.  During periods of declining sales and profitability of franchisees, the incidence of franchisee defaults for these lease payments increases and we are then required to make those payments and seek recourse against the franchisee or agree to repayment terms.  Additionally, if franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements, or if we decide to restructure franchise agreements in order to induce franchisees to renew these agreements, then our royalty revenues may decrease.  Further, we may decide from time to time to acquire restaurants from franchisees that experience significant financial hardship, which may reduce our cash and cash equivalents.Wendy’s may be unable to manage effectively the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.Wendy’s has from time to time acquired the interests of and sold Wendy’s restaurants to franchisees.  Wendy’s will continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions of franchised restaurants and strategic dispositions of Company-operated restaurants to existing and new franchisees.  The success of these transactions is dependent upon the availability of sellers and buyers, the availability of financing, and the brand’s ability to negotiate transactions on terms deemed acceptable.  In addition, the operations of restaurants that the brand acquires may not be integrated successfully, and the intended benefits of such transactions may not be realized.  Acquisitions of franchised restaurants pose various risks to brand operations, including:•diversion of management’s attention to the integration of acquired restaurant operations;•increased operating expenses and the inability to achieve expected cost savings and operating efficiencies;•exposure to liabilities arising out of sellers’ prior operations of acquired restaurants; and•incurrence or assumption of debt to finance acquisitions or improvements and/or the assumption of long-term, non-cancelable leases.In addition, engaging in acquisitions and dispositions places increased demands on the brand’s operational and financial management resources and may require us to continue to expand these resources.  If Wendy’s is unable to manage the acquisition and disposition of restaurants effectively, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.Current restaurant locations may become unattractive, and attractive new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all.The success of any restaurant depends in substantial part on its location.  There can be no assurance that our current restaurant locations will continue to be attractive as demographic patterns change.  Neighborhood or economic conditions where our restaurants are located could decline in the future, thus resulting in potentially reduced sales in those locations.  In addition, rising real estate prices in some areas may restrict our ability and the ability of franchisees to purchase or lease new desirable locations.  If desirable locations cannot be obtained at reasonable prices, the brand’s ability to execute its growth strategies could be adversely affected.Wendy’s leasing and ownership of significant amounts of real estate exposes it to possible liabilities and losses, including liabilities associated with environmental matters.As of December 31, 2017, Wendy’s leased or owned the land and/or the building for 337 Company-operated Wendy’s restaurants.  Wendy’s also owned 521 and leased 1,296 properties that were either leased or subleased principally to franchisees as of December 31, 2017.  Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate.  In particular, the value of our real property assets could decrease, and costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends, supply or demand for the use of the restaurants, which may result from competition from similar restaurants in the area, and liability for environmental matters. 16Wendy’s is subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances.  These environmental laws provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner, operator or occupant of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances.  Third parties may also make claims against owners, operators or occupants of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such substances.  A number of our restaurant sites were formerly gas stations or are adjacent to current or former gas stations, or were used for other commercial activities that can create environmental impacts.  We may also acquire or lease these types of sites in the future.  We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of all of our properties.  We may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our leased and owned properties, and any such liabilities identified in the future could cause us to incur significant costs, including costs associated with litigation, fines or clean-up responsibilities.  In addition, we cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted.  We cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with any environmental laws or regulations or to satisfy any such claims.  See “Item 1. Business - General - Legal and Environmental Matters.”Wendy’s leases real property generally for initial terms of 15 to 20 years with one or more options to extend the term of the leases in consecutive five-year increments.  Many leases provide that the landlord may increase the rent over the term of the lease and any renewals thereof.  Most leases require us to pay all of the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities.  We generally cannot cancel these leases.  If an existing or future restaurant is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term.  In addition, as each lease expires, we may fail to negotiate additional renewals or renewal options, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close restaurants in desirable locations.Due to the concentration of Wendy’s restaurants in particular geographic regions, our business results could be impacted by the adverse economic conditions prevailing in those regions regardless of the state of the national economy as a whole.As of December 31, 2017, we and our franchisees operated Wendy’s restaurants in 50 states, the District of Columbia and 30 foreign countries and territories.  As of December 31, 2017 and as detailed in “Item 2. Properties,” the eight leading states by number of operating units were: Florida, Ohio, Texas, Georgia, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Michigan.  This geographic concentration can cause economic conditions in particular areas of the country to have a disproportionate impact on our overall results of operations.  It is possible that adverse economic conditions in states or regions that contain a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the future.Our operations are influenced by adverse weather conditions.Weather, which is unpredictable, can impact Wendy’s restaurant sales.  Harsh weather conditions that keep customers from dining out result in lost opportunities for our restaurants.  A heavy snowstorm in the Northeast or Midwest or a hurricane in the Southeast can shut down an entire metropolitan area, resulting in a reduction in sales in that area.  Our first quarter includes winter months and historically has a lower level of sales at Company-operated restaurants.  Because a significant portion of our restaurant operating costs is fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of sales during these periods hurts our operating margins, and can result in restaurant operating losses.  For these reasons, a quarter-to-quarter comparison may not be a good indication of Wendy’s performance or how it may perform in the future.Our business could be hurt by increased labor costs or labor shortages.Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our restaurants.  We devote significant resources to recruiting and training its managers and hourly employees.  Increased labor costs due to competition, increased minimum wage or employee benefits costs (including various federal, state and local actions to increase minimum wages), unionization activity or other factors would adversely impact our cost of sales and operating expenses.  In addition, Wendy’s success depends on its ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and staff.  If the brand is unable to do so, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 17Complaints or litigation may hurt the Wendy’s brand.Wendy’s customers file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to a Wendy’s restaurant, or alleging that there was a problem with food quality or operations at a Wendy’s restaurant.  We are also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims from franchisees (which tend to increase when franchisees experience declining sales and profitability) and claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, including class action lawsuits related to these matters.  The Company has also been named as a defendant in the matters described in Note 23 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in Item 8 herein.  Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management’s attention away from operations and hurt our performance.  We cannot estimate the aggregate possible range of loss due to most proceedings being in preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur, and significant factual matters unresolved.  In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties.  Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions are thus inherently difficult.  Insurance policies contain customary limitations, conditions and exclusions that can affect the amount of insurance proceeds ultimately received.  A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.  Further, adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt us and our franchisees.Additionally, the restaurant industry has been subject to a number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have contributed to the obesity of certain of their customers.  Adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may harm the reputation of our restaurants, even if the allegations are not directed against our restaurants or are not valid, and even if we are not found liable or the concerns relate only to a single restaurant or a limited number of restaurants.  Moreover, complaints, litigation or adverse publicity experienced by one or more of Wendy’s franchisees could also hurt our business as a whole.We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of the Wendy’s brand and hurt our business.Our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business.  We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and other intellectual property.  The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both existing and new markets.  If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property, either in print or on the Internet, the value of our brand may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the failure of our brand to achieve and maintain market acceptance.  This could harm our image, brand or competitive position and, if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, cause us to incur significant legal fees.We franchise our brand to various franchisees.  While we try to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by all of our franchisees, we cannot assure that these franchisees will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property or the reputation of the Wendy’s restaurant system.We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions.  The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the United States in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries.  We cannot assure that all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate.  The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.In addition, we cannot assure that third parties will not claim infringement by us in the future.  Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause delays in introducing new menu items, require costly modifications to advertising and promotional materials or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.  As a result, any such claim could harm our business and cause a decline in our results of operations and financial condition. 18Our current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims that have been or may be filed.We currently maintain insurance we believe is adequate for businesses of our size and type.  However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters or acts of terrorism. In addition, we currently self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under workers’ compensation, general liability and property insurance programs.  Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs, which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.The Company currently maintains insurance coverage to address cyber incidents.  Applicable insurance policies contain customary limitations, conditions and exclusions.  There can be no assurance that the cyber policies maintained by the Company will cover substantially all of the Company’s costs and expenses incurred related to the cybersecurity incidents described below in this Item 1A and in Note 23 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in Item 8 herein.Changes in legal or regulatory requirements, including franchising laws, payment card industry rules, overtime rules, minimum wage rates, tax legislation, federal ethanol policy and accounting standards, may adversely affect our ability to open new restaurants or otherwise hurt our existing and future operations and results.Each Wendy’s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, safety and other agencies in the state and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located, as well as to Federal laws, rules and regulations and requirements of non-governmental entities such as payment card industry rules.  State and local government authorities may enact laws, rules or regulations that impact restaurant operations and the cost of conducting those operations.  There can be no assurance that we and/or our franchisees will not experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants, which could delay the opening of such restaurants in the future.  In addition, more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to tax, zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.Federal laws, rules and regulations address many aspects of our business, such as franchising, federal ethanol policy, minimum wages and taxes.  We and our franchisees are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, along with the ADA, family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted by the states that govern these and other employment law matters.  Changes in laws, rules, regulations and governmental policies, including the joint employer standard, could increase our costs and adversely affect our existing and future operations and results.Changes in accounting standards, or in the interpretation of existing standards, applicable to us could also affect our future results.  See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for a summary of new or amended accounting standards applicable to us.We do not exercise ultimate control over purchasing for our restaurant system, which could harm sales or profitability and the brand.Although we ensure that all suppliers to the Wendy’s system meet quality control standards, Wendy’s franchisees control the purchasing of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies from such suppliers through the purchasing co-op controlled by Wendy’s franchisees, QSCC.  QSCC negotiates national contracts for such food, equipment and supplies.  We are entitled to appoint two representatives (of the total of 11) on the board of directors of QSCC and participate in QSCC through our Company-operated restaurants, but we do not control the decisions and activities of QSCC except to ensure that all suppliers satisfy our quality control standards.  If QSCC does not properly estimate the product needs of the Wendy’s system, makes poor purchasing decisions, or decides to cease its operations, system sales and operating costs could be adversely affected and our results of operations and financial condition or the financial condition of Wendy’s franchisees could be hurt. 19Our international operations are subject to various factors of uncertainty and there is no assurance that international operations will be profitable.In addition to many of the risk factors described throughout this Item 1A, Wendy’s business outside of the United States is subject to a number of additional factors, including international economic and political conditions, risk of corruption and violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws of other countries, differing cultures and consumer preferences, the inability to adapt to international customer preferences, inadequate brand infrastructure within foreign countries to support our international activities, inability to obtain adequate supplies meeting our quality standards and product specifications or interruptions in obtaining such supplies, restrictions on our ability to move cash out of certain foreign countries, currency regulations and fluctuations, diverse government regulations and tax systems, uncertain or differing interpretations of rights and obligations in connection with international franchise agreements, the collection of royalties from international franchisees and intellectual property rights, the availability and cost of land, construction costs, other legal, financial or regulatory impediments to the development and/or operation of new restaurants, and the availability of experienced management, appropriate franchisees, and joint venture partners.  Although we believe we have developed the support structure required for international growth, there is no assurance that such growth will occur or that international operations will be profitable.To the extent we invest in international Company-operated restaurants or joint ventures, we would also have the risk of operating losses related to those restaurants, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are heavily dependent on computer systems and information technology and any material failure, interruption or security breach of our computer systems or technology could impair our ability to efficiently operate our business.We are significantly dependent upon our computer systems and information technology to properly conduct our business, including point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures.  Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems and information technology.  The failure of these systems and information technology to operate effectively, an interruption, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems, fraudulent manipulation of sales reporting from our franchised restaurants resulting in loss of sales and royalty payments, or a breach in security of these systems could be harmful and cause delays in customer service, result in the loss of data and reduce efficiency or cause delays in operations.  Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any problems.  Any security breach involving our or our franchisees’ point-of-sale or other systems could result in a loss of consumer confidence and potential costs associated with fraud.  Also, despite our considerable efforts and technological resources to secure our computer systems and information technology, security breaches, such as unauthorized access and computer viruses, may occur, resulting in system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  A security breach of our computer systems or information technology could require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, and incur penalties or other costs that could adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations.As part of our marketing efforts, we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain customers.  These efforts may not be successful, and pose a variety of other risks, including the improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about the Wendy’s brand, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud or out of date information.  The inappropriate use of social media vehicles by franchisees, customers, or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.  The occurrence of any such developments could have an adverse effect on business results. 20The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in cybersecurity, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of confidential information, and/or damage to our employee and business relationships, all of which could subject us to loss and harm the Wendy’s brand.A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information resources.  More specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information about customers, franchisees, vendors and employees.  A number of retailers and other companies have recently experienced serious cyber incidents and breaches of their information technology systems.  The Wendy’s system has also experienced unusual credit card activity at some Wendy’s restaurants, as further described below.  As the Company’s reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to its systems, both internal and those it has outsourced.  The three primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption, damage to the relationship with customers, franchisees and employees and private data exposure.  In addition to maintaining insurance coverage to address cyber incidents, the Company has also implemented processes, procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks.  However, these measures, as well as its increased awareness of a risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that the Company’s reputation and financial results will not be adversely affected by such an incident.Because the Company and its franchisees accept electronic forms of payment from their customers, the Company’s business requires the collection and retention of customer data, including credit and debit card numbers and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that the Company and its franchisees maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom the Company and its franchisees contract to provide credit card processing.  The Company also maintains important internal Company data, such as personally identifiable information about its employees and franchisees and information relating to its operations.  The Company’s use of personally identifiable information is regulated by foreign, federal and state laws, as well as by certain third-party agreements.  As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, the Company may incur additional costs to ensure that it remains in compliance with those laws and regulations.  If the Company’s security and information systems are compromised or if its employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws, regulations, or contract terms, and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect the Company’s reputation and could disrupt its operations and result in costly litigation, judgments, or penalties resulting from violation of federal and state laws and payment card industry regulations.  A cyber incident could also require the Company to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, increase fees payable to third parties, and incur penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect the operation of the Company’s business and results of operations.Certain of our franchisees have experienced cybersecurity incidents.The Company first reported unusual payment card activity affecting some franchise-owned restaurants in February 2016 and that malware had been discovered on certain systems.  Subsequently, on June 9, 2016, the Company reported that an additional malware variant had been identified and disabled.  On July 7, 2016, the Company, on behalf of affected franchise locations, provided information about specific restaurant locations that may have been impacted by these attacks, all of which are located in the United States, along with support for customers who may have been affected by the malware variants.Working closely with third-party forensic experts, federal law enforcement and payment card industry contacts as part of its investigation, the Company determined that specific payment card information was targeted by the additional malware variant.  This information included cardholder name, credit or debit card number, expiration date, cardholder verification value and service code.The Company believes the criminal cyberattacks resulted from service providers’ remote access credentials being compromised, allowing access, and the ability to deploy malware, to some franchisees’ point-of-sale systems.  There has been no indication in the investigation that any Company-operated restaurants were impacted by this activity.The Company worked with investigators to disable the malware involved in the first attack in 2016.  Soon after detecting the malware variant involved in the latest attack, the Company identified a method of disabling it and thereafter disabled it in all franchisee restaurants where it was discovered.  The investigation has confirmed that criminals used malware believed to have been effectively deployed on some Wendy’s franchisee systems starting in late fall 2015. 21The Company has been named as a defendant in a putative class action filed in the United States on behalf of customers, as well as five class actions brought by financial institutions in the United States that have been consolidated into a single proceeding.  In addition, certain of the Company’s present and former directors, and one non-director executive officer of the Company, were named as defendants in a putative shareholder derivative complaint alleging breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment and gross mismanagement.  These civil proceedings seek damages and other relief allegedly arising from the cybersecurity incident.  In addition, claims may also be made by payment card networks against the affected franchisees.  These claims and investigations may adversely affect how we or our franchisees operate the business, divert the attention of management from the operation of the business, have an adverse effect on our reputation, result in additional costs and adversely affect our results of operations.We may be required to recognize additional asset impairment and other asset-related charges.We have significant amounts of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets and have incurred impairment charges in the past with respect to those assets.  In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we test for impairment generally annually, or more frequently, if there are indicators of impairment, such as:•significant adverse changes in the business climate;•current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with long-lived assets;•a current expectation that more-likely-than-not (i.e., a likelihood that is more than 50%) long-lived assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life; and•a significant drop in our stock price.Based upon future economic and capital market conditions, as well as the operating performance of our reporting units, future impairment charges could be incurred.  Further, as a result of the system optimization initiative, the Company has recorded losses on remeasuring long-lived assets to fair value upon determination that the assets will be leased and/or subleased to franchisees in connection with the sale or anticipated sale of restaurants, and may incur further losses as the Company sells restaurants from time to time.The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions, and substantially all of the assets of certain subsidiaries are security, under the terms of a securitization transaction.On January 17, 2018, Wendy’s Funding, LLC (the “Master Issuer”), a limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, completed a refinancing transaction under which the Master Issuer issued Series 2018-1 3.573% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I (the “Series 2018-1 Class A-2-I Notes”) with an initial principal amount of $450.0 million and Series 2018-1 3.884% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II (the “Series 2018-1 Class A-2-II Notes”) with an initial principal amount of $475.0 million (collectively, the “Series 2018-1 Class A-2 Notes”).  Interest payments on the Series 2018-1 Class A-2 Notes are payable on a quarterly basis.  The net proceeds from the sale of the Series 2018-1 Class A-2 Notes were used to redeem the Master Issuer’s outstanding Series 2015-1 Class A-2-I Notes, to pay prepayment and transaction costs, and for general corporate purposes.Concurrently, the Master Issuer entered into a revolving financing facility of Series 2018-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 (the “Series 2018-1 Class A-1 Notes” and, together with the Series 2018-1 Class A-2 Notes, the “Series 2018-1 Senior Notes”), which allows for the drawing of up to $150.0 million under the Series 2018-1 Class A-1 Notes, which include certain credit instruments, including a letter of credit facility.  On the closing date, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its Series 2018-1 Class A-1 Notes.  The Series 2015-1 Class A-1 Notes were canceled on the closing date and the letters of credit outstanding against the Series 2015-1 Class A-1 Notes were transferred to the Series 2018-1 Class A-1 Notes.In addition to the Series 2018-1 Senior Notes, the Master Issuer also has outstanding the Series 2015-1 4.080% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II (the “Class A-2-II Notes”) and the Series 2015-1 4.497% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-III, (the “Class A-2-III Notes”) (collectively, the “remaining Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes”) that were issued on June 1, 2015.  The Series 2018-1 Senior Notes and the remaining Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes are collectively the “Senior Notes.” 22The Senior Notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Master Issuer and certain other limited-purpose, bankruptcy remote, wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company that act as guarantors (collectively, the “Securitization Entities”), except for certain real estate assets and subject to certain limitations as set forth in the applicable Indenture (as amended and supplemented) and the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement.  The assets of the Securitization Entities include most of the domestic and certain of the foreign revenue-generating assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, which principally consist of franchise-related agreements, certain company-operated restaurants, intellectual property and license agreements for the use of intellectual property.The Senior Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including (i) that the Master Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Senior Notes, (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments in the case of the Series 2018-1 Class A-2 Notes and the remaining Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes under certain circumstances, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the assets pledged as collateral for the Senior Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters.  The Senior Notes are also subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service coverage ratios, the sum of global gross sales for specified restaurants being below certain levels on certain measurement dates, certain manager termination events, an event of default, and the failure to repay or refinance the Series 2018-1 Class A-2 Notes or the remaining Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes on the applicable scheduled maturity date.  The Senior Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal, or other amounts due on or with respect to the Senior Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective, and certain judgments.In the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the Indenture (including, without limitation, upon an event of default under the Indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the applicable term), the funds available to the Company would be reduced or eliminated, which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business.  If the Company’s subsidiaries are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations, they may need to refinance or restructure debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital.  If the Company’s subsidiaries are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, they may not be able to meet debt payment and other obligations.The Company has a significant amount of debt outstanding. Such indebtedness, along with the other contractual commitments of its subsidiaries, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to meet debt payment obligations.The Company has approximately $2.8 billion of outstanding debt, including debt issued in the securitization transaction on June 1, 2015 and the refinancing transaction that was completed on January 17, 2018.  Additionally, a subsidiary of the Company has issued the Series 2018-1 Class A-1 Notes, which will allow the subsidiary to borrow amounts from time to time on a revolving basis, up to an aggregate principal amount of $150.0 million.This level of debt could have significant consequences on the Company’s future operations, including:•making it more difficult to meet payment and other obligations under outstanding debt;•resulting in an event of default if the Company’s subsidiaries fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of the Company’s subsidiaries’ debt becoming immediately due and payable;•reducing the availability of the Company’s cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;•subjecting the Company to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on indebtedness with variable interest rates;•limiting the Company’s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing its vulnerability to, changes in the Company’s business, the industry in which it operates and the general economy; and•placing the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that are less leveraged. 23In addition, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries also have significant contractual requirements for the purchase of soft drinks.  If consumer preferences change and the Company’s customers purchase fewer soft drinks than expected or estimated, such contractual commitments may adversely affect the financial condition of the Company.  The Company has also provided loan guarantees to various lenders on behalf of franchisees entering into debt arrangements for new restaurant development and equipment financing.  Certain subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have been indemnified.  In addition, certain subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have not been indemnified.  These commitments could have an adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity and the ability of its subsidiaries to meet payment obligations.The ability to meet payment and other obligations under the debt instruments of the Company’s subsidiaries depends on their ability to generate significant cash flow in the future.  This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, as well as other factors that are beyond the Company’s control.  There can be no assurance that the Company’s business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to it under existing or any future credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable its subsidiaries to meet their debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs.  If the Company’s subsidiaries are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations, they may need to refinance or restructure debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital.  If the Company’s subsidiaries are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, they may not be able to meet debt payment and other obligations.In addition, the Company may incur additional indebtedness in the future.  If new debt or other liabilities are added to the Company’s current consolidated debt levels, the related risks that it now faces could intensify.The securitization transaction documents impose certain restrictions on the activities of the Company and its subsidiaries.The Indenture and the management agreement entered into between a subsidiary of the Company and the Indenture trustee (the “Management Agreement”) contain various covenants that limit the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to engage in specified types of transactions.  For example, the Indenture and the Management Agreement contain covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of certain subsidiaries to:•incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;•sell certain assets;•create or incur liens on certain assets to secure indebtedness; or•consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets.As a result of these restrictions, the Company may not have adequate resources or flexibility to continue to manage the business and provide for growth of the Wendy’s system, including product development and marketing for the Wendy’s brand, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future growth prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.To service debt and meet its other cash needs, Wendy’s will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be generated or available to it.The ability of Wendy’s to make payments on, repay or refinance its debt, including debt issued in the securitization transaction on June 1, 2015 and the refinancing transaction completed on January 17, 2018, and any additional debt, and to fund planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend largely upon its future operating performance.  Future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.  In addition, the ability of Wendy’s to borrow funds in the future to make payments on its debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in its credit facilities and other debt agreements, including those for the debt issued in the securitization transaction on June 1, 2015 and the refinancing transaction completed on January 17, 2018, and other agreements it may enter into in the future.  Specifically, Wendy’s will need to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests.  There is no assurance that the Wendy’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under its credit facilities or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its debt or to fund its or the Company’s dividend and other liquidity needs. 24There can be no assurance regarding whether or to what extent the Company will pay dividends on its Common Stock in the future.Holders of the Company’s Common Stock will only be entitled to receive such dividends as its Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments.  Any dividends will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the Company’s earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time.Because the Company is a holding company, its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent upon cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand and cash flows from its subsidiaries.  The ability of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends and/or make loans or advances to the holding company will be dependent upon their respective abilities to achieve sufficient cash flows after satisfying their respective cash requirements, including subsidiary-level debt service and revolving credit agreements, to enable the payment of such dividends or the making of such loans or advances.  The ability of any of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or other payments to the Company will also be limited by restrictions in debt instruments currently existing or subsequently entered into by such subsidiaries, which is described earlier in this Item 1A.A substantial amount of the Company’s Common Stock is concentrated in the hands of certain stockholders.Nelson Peltz, the Company’s Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, Peter May, the Company’s Vice Chairman and former President and Chief Operating Officer, and Edward Garden, who resigned as a director of the Company on December 14, 2015, beneficially own shares of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock that collectively constitute more than 20% of its total voting power as of February 20, 2018.  Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden may, from time to time, acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of Common Stock.On December 1, 2011, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Trian Agreement”) with Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden, and several of their affiliates (the “Covered Persons”).  Pursuant to the Trian Agreement, the Board of Directors, including a majority of the independent directors, approved, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“Section 203”), the Covered Persons becoming the owners (as defined in Section 203(c)(9) of the DGCL) of or acquiring an aggregate of up to (and including), but not more than, 32.5% (subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Agreement) of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock, such that no such persons would be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 203 solely as a result of such ownership.  Certain other provisions of the Trian Agreement terminated when the Covered Persons’ beneficial ownership of the Company’s Common Stock decreased to less than 25% of the outstanding voting power of the Company in January, 2014.This concentration of ownership gives Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden significant influence over the outcome of actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets.  They are also in a position to have significant influence to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.  If in the future Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden were to acquire more than a majority of the Company’s outstanding voting power, they would be able to determine the outcome of the election of members of the Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring majority stockholder approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets.  They would also be in a position to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.The Company’s certificate of incorporation contains certain anti-takeover provisions and permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and limits its ability to raise capital from affiliates.Certain provisions in the Company’s certificate of incorporation are intended to discourage or delay a hostile takeover of control of the Company.  The Company’s certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of “blank check” preferred stock, which will have such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.  Accordingly, the Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of its common stock.  The preferred stock could be used to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that is determined by the Board of Directors to be undesirable.  Although the Company has no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock, it cannot assure that it will not do so in the future.The Company’s certificate of incorporation prohibits the issuance of preferred stock to affiliates, unless offered ratably to the holders of the Company’s Common Stock, subject to an exception in the event that the Company is in financial distress and the issuance is approved by its audit committee.

.We wish to caution readers that in addition to the important factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we have included below the most significant factors that have affected, or in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results during fiscal 2017, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.Our success depends in part upon the continued retention of certain key personnel.There were several changes to the senior management team in May, 2016.  Todd Penegor, who had been Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and International, assumed the duties of President and Chief Executive Officer.  Gunther Plosch was appointed Chief Financial Officer.  Robert D. Wright, formerly Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, was appointed Executive Vice President, Chief Operations Officer and International.  Liliana M. Esposito, Chief Communications Officer, assumed additional responsibilities for quality assurance.  In addition, in October, 2016, E.J. Wunsch was appointed General Counsel and Secretary.  His title became Chief Legal Officer and Secretary in February, 2017.We believe that over time our success has been dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management team.  The failure by us to retain members of our senior management team in the future could adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts we have undertaken to increase the efficiency and profitability of our business.Competition from other restaurant companies as well as grocery chains and other retail food outlets, or poor customer experience at Wendy’s restaurants, could hurt our brand.The market segments in which Company-operated and franchised Wendy’s restaurants compete are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, price, food quality and presentation, service, location, convenience, and the nature and condition of the restaurant facility.  If customers have a poor experience at a Wendy’s restaurant, whether at a Company-operated or franchised restaurant, we may experience a decrease in guest traffic.  Further, Wendy’s restaurants compete with a variety of locally-owned restaurants, as well as competitive regional and national chains and franchises.  Several of these chains compete by offering menu items that are targeted at certain consumer groups or dietary trends.  Additionally, many of our competitors have introduced lower cost, value meal menu options.  Our revenues and those of our franchisees may be hurt by this product and price competition.Moreover, new companies, including operators outside the quick-service restaurant industry, may enter our market areas and target our customer base.  For example, additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases have come from deli sections and in-store cafes of a number of major grocery store chains, as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets.  Such competitors may have, among other things, lower operating costs, better locations, better facilities, better management, better products, more effective marketing and more efficient operations.  Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing and marketing strategies in the quick-service restaurant industry better than we can.  Many of our competitors spend significantly more on advertising and marketing than we do, which may give them a competitive advantage through higher levels of brand awareness among consumers.  Wendy’s also competes with grocery chains and other retail outlets which sell food that will be prepared at home.  Competition with these chains and other outlets has increased as the gap between the price of food at home compared to food purchased at restaurants has widened.All such competition may adversely affect our revenues and profits by reducing revenues of Company-operated restaurants and royalty revenue from franchised restaurants.Changes in consumer tastes and preferences, and in discretionary consumer spending, could result in a decline in sales at Company-operated restaurants and in the royalties that we receive from franchisees.The quick-service restaurant industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions, discretionary spending priorities, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants.  Our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income.  Accordingly, we may experience declines in sales during economic downturns.  Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending or a decline in consumer food-away-from-home spending could hurt our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition. 12If Company-operated and franchised restaurants are unable to adapt to changes in consumer preferences and trends, Company-operated and franchised restaurants may lose customers and the resulting revenues from Company-operated restaurants and the royalties that we receive from franchisees may decline.Disruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.Disruptions in the national and global economies could result in higher unemployment rates and declines in consumer confidence and spending.  If such disruptions occur, they may result in significant declines in consumer food-away-from-home spending and customer traffic in our restaurants and those of our franchisees.  There can be no assurance that government responses to the disruptions will restore consumer confidence.  Ongoing disruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.Changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken and grains), supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs could harm results of operations.Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken and grains), supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs.  Commodity cost pressures, and any increase in these costs, especially beef or chicken prices, could adversely affect future operating results.  In addition, our business is susceptible to increases in these costs as a result of other factors beyond its control, such as weather conditions, global demand, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulations.  Further, prices for feed ingredients used to produce beef and chicken could be adversely affected by changes in global weather patterns, which are inherently unpredictable, and by federal ethanol policy.  Increases in gasoline prices could result in the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors, which would increase our costs.  Significant increases in expenses incurred by consumers, such as living expenses or gasoline prices, could also result in a decrease in customer traffic at our restaurants, which could adversely affect our business.  We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results.  In addition, we may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to our customers.Shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of perishable food products could damage the Wendy’s brand reputation and adversely affect our sales and operating results.Wendy’s and its franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet brand specifications.  Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, disease or food-borne illnesses, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which could lower our revenues, increase operating costs, damage brand reputation and otherwise harm our business and the businesses of our franchisees.Food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. Coli) involving Wendy’s, its supply chain or other food service companies, could create negative publicity and adversely affect sales and operating results.Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe, quality food products.  However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. Coli), have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future.Food safety events could adversely affect the price and availability of beef, poultry or other meats.  As a result, Wendy’s restaurants could experience a significant increase in food costs if there are food safety events whether or not such events involve Wendy’s restaurants or restaurants of competitors.In addition, food safety events, whether or not involving Wendy’s, could result in negative publicity for Wendy’s or for the industry or market segments in which we operate.  Increased use of social media could create and/or amplify the effects of negative publicity.  This negative publicity, as well as any other negative publicity concerning types of food products Wendy’s serves, may reduce demand for Wendy’s food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types.  A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could result in a decline in sales and operating results at Company-operated restaurants or in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants. 13Consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of beef, poultry, french fries or other products we sell, concerns regarding the ingredients in our products and/or cooking processes used in our restaurants, or concerns regarding the effects of disease outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics could affect demand for our products.Consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of beef, poultry, french fries or other products we sell, concerns regarding the ingredients in our products and/or cooking processes used in our restaurants, or concerns regarding the effects of disease outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics could result in less demand for our products and a decline in sales at Company-operated restaurants and in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.Increased use of social media could create and/or amplify the effects of negative publicity and adversely affect sales and operating results.Events reported in the media, including social media, whether or not accurate or involving Wendy’s, could create and/or amplify negative publicity for Wendy’s or for the industry or market segments in which we operate.  This could reduce demand for Wendy’s food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types.  A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of negative publicity from social media could result in a decline in sales and operating results at Company-operated restaurants or in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.Growth of our restaurant business is dependent on new restaurant openings, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.Our restaurant business derives earnings from sales at Company-operated restaurants, franchise royalties received from franchised restaurants and franchise fees from franchise restaurant operators for each new unit opened.  Growth in our restaurant revenues and earnings is dependent on new restaurant openings.  Numerous factors beyond our control may affect restaurant openings.  These factors include but are not limited to:•our ability to attract new franchisees;•the availability of site locations for new restaurants;•the ability of potential restaurant owners to obtain financing;•the ability of restaurant owners to hire, train and retain qualified operating personnel;•construction and development costs of new restaurants, particularly in highly-competitive markets;•the ability of restaurant owners to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all; and•adverse weather conditions.Wendy’s franchisees could take actions that could harm our business.As of January 1, 2017, approximately 95% of restaurants in the Wendy’s system were operated by franchisees.  Wendy’s franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with the standards set forth in agreements with them.  Wendy’s also provides training and support to franchisees.  However, franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and the franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants.  Specifically, franchisees are solely responsible for developing and utilizing their own policies, procedures and documents, making their own hiring, firing and disciplinary decisions, scheduling hours and establishing wages, and managing their day-to-day employment processes and procedures, all of which is done independent of Wendy’s and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules or regulations.  Further, franchisees have discretion as to the prices charged to customers.  As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee.  If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with required standards, then royalty payments to us could be adversely affected and the brand’s image and reputation could be harmed, both of which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.In addition, the failure of franchisees to adequately engage in succession planning may affect their restaurant operations and development of new Wendy’s restaurants, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results. 14Our success depends on franchisees’ participation in brand strategies.Wendy’s franchisees are an integral part of our business.  Wendy’s may be unable to successfully implement the strategies that it believes are necessary for further growth if franchisees do not participate in that implementation.  Our business and operating results could be adversely affected if a significant number of franchisees do not participate in brand strategies.Our Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at Company-operated and participating franchised restaurants or improve our results of operations, and franchisees may not participate in the Image Activation program to the extent expected by the Company.The Company and its franchisees reimaged 521 North America system restaurants and built 99 new North America restaurants in 2016.  The North America system now has 32% of restaurants on the new image.  The Company has plans for significantly more new and reimaged Company and franchisee restaurants in 2017 and beyond.In order to promote Image Activation new restaurant development, Wendy’s has an incentive program for franchisees that provides for reductions in royalty and national advertising payments for up to the first two years of operation for qualifying new restaurants opened by December 31, 2020, with the value of the incentives declining in the later years of the program.  Wendy’s also has incentive programs for 2017 available to franchisees that commence Image Activation restaurant remodels by December 15, 2017.  The remodel incentive programs provide for reductions in royalty payments for one year after the completion of construction.  Wendy’s also had incentive programs that were available for franchisees’ participation in Wendy’s Image Activation program in 2014, 2015 and 2016.The Company’s Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at Company-operated restaurants or improve results of operations.  There can be no assurance that sales at participating franchised restaurants will achieve or maintain projected levels or that after giving effect to the incentives provided to franchisees the Company’s results of operations will improve.  There can also be no assurance that franchisees will participate in the Image Activation program to the extent expected by the Company.Further, it is possible that Wendy’s may provide other financial incentives to franchisees to participate in the Image Activation program.  These incentives could also result in additional expense and/or a reduction of royalties or other revenues received from franchisees in the future.  If Wendy’s provides additional incentives to franchisees related to financing of the Image Activation program, Wendy’s may incur costs related to loan guarantees, interest rate subsidies and/or costs related to collectability of loans.In addition, most of the Wendy’s system consists of franchised restaurants.  Many of our franchisees will need to borrow funds in order to participate in the Image Activation program.  Other than the incentive programs described above, Wendy’s generally does not provide franchisees with financing but it continues to develop third-party financing sources for franchisees.  If our franchisees are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or not at all, they may be unwilling or unable to invest in the reimaging of their existing restaurants and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our financial results are affected by the operating results of franchisees.As of January 1, 2017, approximately 95% of the Wendy’s system were franchise restaurants.  We receive revenue in the form of royalties, which are generally based on a percentage of sales at franchised restaurants, rent and fees from franchisees.  Accordingly, a substantial portion of our financial results is to a large extent dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees.  If sales trends or economic conditions worsen for franchisees, their financial results may worsen and our royalty, rent and other fee revenues may decline.  In addition, accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts may increase.  When Company-operated restaurants are sold, one of our subsidiaries is often required to remain responsible for lease payments for these restaurants to the extent that the purchasing franchisees default on their leases.  During periods of declining sales and profitability of franchisees, the incidence of franchisee defaults for these lease payments increases and we are then required to make those payments and seek recourse against the franchisee or agree to repayment terms.  Additionally, if franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements, or if we decide to restructure franchise agreements in order to induce franchisees to renew these agreements, then our royalty revenues may decrease.  Further, we may decide from time to time to acquire restaurants from franchisees that experience significant financial hardship, which may reduce our cash and cash equivalents. 15The system optimization initiative involves risks that could adversely affect our business and financial results.The Company completed its plan to reduce its Company-operated restaurant ownership to approximately 5% with the sale of 310 restaurants during 2016.  There are a number of risks associated with the system optimization initiative, including the impact of the sale of restaurants on ongoing operations, any tax impact from the sale of restaurants, and the future impact to the Company’s earnings, restaurant operating margin, cash flow and depreciation.  If Wendy’s is unable to manage these risks effectively, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.Further, Wendy’s generally retains ownership or the leasehold interest to the real estate when it sells restaurants under the system optimization initiative and leases or subleases the real estate to franchisees.  This increases the risks described above under the heading “Our financial results are affected by the operating results of franchisees.”Wendy’s may be unable to manage effectively the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.Wendy’s has from time to time acquired the interests of and sold Wendy’s restaurants to franchisees.  Wendy’s will continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions of franchised restaurants and strategic dispositions of Company-operated restaurants to existing and new franchisees.  The success of these transactions is dependent upon the availability of sellers and buyers, the availability of financing, and the brand’s ability to negotiate transactions on terms deemed acceptable.  In addition, the operations of restaurants that the brand acquires may not be integrated successfully, and the intended benefits of such transactions may not be realized.  Acquisitions of franchised restaurants pose various risks to brand operations, including:•diversion of management’s attention to the integration of acquired restaurant operations;•increased operating expenses and the inability to achieve expected cost savings and operating efficiencies;•exposure to liabilities arising out of sellers’ prior operations of acquired restaurants; and•incurrence or assumption of debt to finance acquisitions or improvements and/or the assumption of long-term, non-cancelable leases.In addition, engaging in acquisitions and dispositions places increased demands on the brand’s operational and financial management resources and may require us to continue to expand these resources.  If Wendy’s is unable to manage the acquisition and disposition of restaurants effectively, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.Current restaurant locations may become unattractive, and attractive new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all.The success of any restaurant depends in substantial part on its location.  There can be no assurance that our current restaurant locations will continue to be attractive as demographic patterns change.  Neighborhood or economic conditions where our restaurants are located could decline in the future, thus resulting in potentially reduced sales in those locations.  In addition, rising real estate prices in some areas may restrict our ability and the ability of franchisees to purchase or lease new desirable locations.  If desirable locations cannot be obtained at reasonable prices, the brand’s ability to execute its growth strategies could be adversely affected.Wendy’s leasing and ownership of significant amounts of real estate exposes it to possible liabilities and losses, including liabilities associated with environmental matters.As of January 1, 2017, Wendy’s leased or owned the land and/or the building for 330 Company-operated Wendy’s restaurants.  Wendy’s also owned 519 and leased 979 properties that were either leased or subleased principally to franchisees as of January 1, 2017.  Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate.  In particular, the value of our real property assets could decrease, and costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends, supply or demand for the use of the restaurants, which may result from competition from similar restaurants in the area, and liability for environmental matters.Wendy’s is subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances.  These environmental laws provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner, operator or occupant of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances.  Third parties may also make claims against owners, operators or occupants of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged  16exposure to, such substances.  A number of our restaurant sites were formerly gas stations or are adjacent to current or former gas stations, or were used for other commercial activities that can create environmental impacts.  We may also acquire or lease these types of sites in the future.  We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of all of our properties.  We may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our leased and owned properties, and any such liabilities identified in the future could cause us to incur significant costs, including costs associated with litigation, fines or clean-up responsibilities.  In addition, we cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted.  We cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with any environmental laws or regulations or to satisfy any such claims.  See “Item 1. Business - General - Legal and Environmental Matters.”Wendy’s leases real property generally for initial terms of 15 to 20 years with one or more options to extend the term of the leases in consecutive five-year increments.  Many leases provide that the landlord may increase the rent over the term of the lease and any renewals thereof.  Most leases require us to pay all of the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities.  We generally cannot cancel these leases.  If an existing or future restaurant is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term.  In addition, as each lease expires, we may fail to negotiate additional renewals or renewal options, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close restaurants in desirable locations.Due to the concentration of Wendy’s restaurants in particular geographic regions, our business results could be impacted by the adverse economic conditions prevailing in those regions regardless of the state of the national economy as a whole.As of January 1, 2017, we and our franchisees operated Wendy’s restaurants in 50 states, the District of Columbia and 30 foreign countries and territories.  As of January 1, 2017 and as detailed in “Item 2. Properties,” the eight leading states by number of operating units were: Florida, Texas, Ohio, Georgia, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina.  This geographic concentration can cause economic conditions in particular areas of the country to have a disproportionate impact on our overall results of operations.  It is possible that adverse economic conditions in states or regions that contain a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the future.Our operations are influenced by adverse weather conditions.Weather, which is unpredictable, can impact Wendy’s restaurant sales.  Harsh weather conditions that keep customers from dining out result in lost opportunities for our restaurants.  A heavy snowstorm in the Northeast or Midwest or a hurricane in the Southeast can shut down an entire metropolitan area, resulting in a reduction in sales in that area.  Our first quarter includes winter months and historically has a lower level of sales at Company-operated restaurants.  Because a significant portion of our restaurant operating costs is fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of sales during these periods hurts our operating margins, and can result in restaurant operating losses.  For these reasons, a quarter-to-quarter comparison may not be a good indication of Wendy’s performance or how it may perform in the future.Our business could be hurt by increased labor costs or labor shortages.Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our restaurants.  We devote significant resources to recruiting and training its managers and hourly employees.  Increased labor costs due to competition, increased minimum wage or employee benefits costs (including various federal, state and local actions to increase minimum wages and government-mandated health care benefits), unionization activity or other factors would adversely impact our cost of sales and operating expenses.  In addition, Wendy’s success depends on its ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and staff.  If the brand is unable to do so, our results of operations could be adversely affected.Complaints or litigation may hurt the Wendy’s brand.Wendy’s customers file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to a Wendy’s restaurant, or alleging that there was a problem with food quality or operations at a Wendy’s restaurant.  We are also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims from franchisees (which tend to increase when franchisees experience declining sales and profitability) and claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, including class action lawsuits related to these matters.  The Company has also been named as a defendant in the matters described in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.”  Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management’s attention away from operations and hurt our performance.  We cannot estimate the aggregate possible range of loss due to most proceedings being in preliminary stages, with various motions  17either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur, and significant factual matters unresolved.  In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties.  Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions are thus inherently difficult.  Insurance policies contain customary limitations, conditions and exclusions that can affect the amount of insurance proceeds ultimately received.  A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.  Further, adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt us and our franchisees.Additionally, the restaurant industry has been subject to a number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have contributed to the obesity of certain of their customers.  Adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may harm the reputation of our restaurants, even if the allegations are not directed against our restaurants or are not valid, and even if we are not found liable or the concerns relate only to a single restaurant or a limited number of restaurants.  Moreover, complaints, litigation or adverse publicity experienced by one or more of Wendy’s franchisees could also hurt our business as a whole.We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of the Wendy’s brand and hurt our business.Our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business.  We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and other intellectual property.  The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both existing and new markets.  If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property, either in print or on the Internet, the value of our brand may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the failure of our brand to achieve and maintain market acceptance.  This could harm our image, brand or competitive position and, if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, cause us to incur significant legal fees.We franchise our brand to various franchisees.  While we try to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by all of our franchisees, we cannot assure that these franchisees will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property or the reputation of the Wendy’s restaurant system.We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions.  The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the United States in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries.  We cannot assure that all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate.  The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.In addition, we cannot assure that third parties will not claim infringement by us in the future.  Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause delays in introducing new menu items, require costly modifications to advertising and promotional materials or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.  As a result, any such claim could harm our business and cause a decline in our results of operations and financial condition.Our current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims that have been or may be filed.We currently maintain insurance we believe is adequate for businesses of our size and type.  However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters or acts of terrorism. In addition, we currently self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under workers compensation, general liability and property insurance programs.  Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs, which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.The Company currently maintains insurance coverage to address cyber incidents.  Applicable insurance policies contain customary limitations, conditions and exclusions.  There can be no assurance that the cyber policies maintained by the Company will cover substantially all of the Company’s costs and expenses incurred related to the cybersecurity incidents described below in this Item 1A and in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.” 18Changes in legal or regulatory requirements, including franchising laws, payment card industry rules, overtime rules, minimum wage rates, government-mandated health care benefits, tax legislation, federal ethanol policy and accounting standards, may adversely affect our ability to open new restaurants or otherwise hurt our existing and future operations and results.Each Wendy’s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, safety and other agencies in the state and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located, as well as to Federal laws, rules and regulations and requirements of non-governmental entities such as payment card industry rules.  State and local government authorities may enact laws, rules or regulations that impact restaurant operations and the cost of conducting those operations.  There can be no assurance that we and/or our franchisees will not experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants, which could delay the opening of such restaurants in the future.  In addition, more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to tax, zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.Federal laws, rules and regulations address many aspects of our business, such as franchising, federal ethanol policy, minimum wages and taxes.  We and our franchisees are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, along with the ADA, family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted by the states that govern these and other employment law matters.  Changes in laws, rules, regulations and governmental policies, including the joint employer standard, could increase our costs and adversely affect our existing and future operations and results.It is possible that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) could be amended or repealed in the future.  The Company cannot predict the extent to which amendment or repeal of the PPACA, or the implementation of another government-mandated health care program, might require modifications to our benefits policies and practices, result in disruptions to our operations or our ability to attract and retain personnel, or result in increased health care costs.Changes in accounting standards, or in the interpretation of existing standards, applicable to us could also affect our future results.  See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for a summary of new or amended accounting standards applicable to us.We do not exercise ultimate control over purchasing for our restaurant system, which could harm sales or profitability and the brand.Although we ensure that all suppliers to the Wendy’s system meet quality control standards, Wendy’s franchisees control the purchasing of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies from such suppliers through the purchasing co-op controlled by Wendy’s franchisees, QSCC.  QSCC negotiates national contracts for such food, equipment and supplies.  We are entitled to appoint two representatives (of the total of 11) on the board of directors of QSCC and participates in QSCC through its Company-operated restaurants, but we do not control the decisions and activities of QSCC except to ensure that all suppliers satisfy our quality control standards.  If QSCC does not properly estimate the product needs of the Wendy’s system, makes poor purchasing decisions, or decides to cease its operations, system sales and operating costs could be adversely affected and our results of operations and financial condition or the financial condition of Wendy’s franchisees could be hurt.Our international operations are subject to various factors of uncertainty and there is no assurance that international operations will be profitable.In addition to many of the risk factors described throughout this Item 1A, Wendy’s business outside of the United States is subject to a number of additional factors, including international economic and political conditions, risk of corruption and violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws of other countries, differing cultures and consumer preferences, the inability to adapt to international customer preferences, inadequate brand infrastructure within foreign countries to support our international activities, inability to obtain adequate supplies meeting our quality standards and product specifications or interruptions in obtaining such supplies, restrictions on our ability to move cash out of certain foreign countries, currency regulations and fluctuations, diverse government regulations and tax systems, uncertain or differing interpretations of rights and obligations in connection with international franchise agreements, the collection of royalties from international franchisees and intellectual property rights, the availability and cost of land, construction costs, other legal, financial or regulatory impediments to the development and/or operation of new restaurants, and the availability of experienced management, appropriate franchisees, and joint venture partners.  Although we believe we have developed the support structure required for international growth, there is no assurance that such growth will occur or that international operations will be profitable. 19To the extent we invest in international Company-operated restaurants or joint ventures, we would also have the risk of operating losses related to those restaurants, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are heavily dependent on computer systems and information technology and any material failure, interruption or security breach of our computer systems or technology could impair our ability to efficiently operate our business.We are significantly dependent upon our computer systems and information technology to properly conduct our business, including point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures.  Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems and information technology.  The failure of these systems and information technology to operate effectively, an interruption, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems, fraudulent manipulation of sales reporting from our franchised restaurants resulting in loss of sales and royalty payments, or a breach in security of these systems could be harmful and cause delays in customer service, result in the loss of data and reduce efficiency or cause delays in operations.  Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any problems.  Any security breach involving our or our franchisees’ point-of-sale or other systems could result in a loss of consumer confidence and potential costs associated with fraud.  Also, despite our considerable efforts and technological resources to secure our computer systems and information technology, security breaches, such as unauthorized access and computer viruses, may occur, resulting in system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  A security breach of our computer systems or information technology could require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, and incur penalties or other costs that could adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations.As part of our marketing efforts, we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain customers.  These efforts may not be successful, and pose a variety of other risks, including the improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about the Wendy’s brand, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud or out of date information.  The inappropriate use of social media vehicles by franchisees, customers, or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.  The occurrence of any such developments could have an adverse effect on business results.The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in cybersecurity, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of confidential information, and/or damage to our employee and business relationships, all of which could subject us to loss and harm the Wendy’s brand.A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information resources.  More specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information about customers, franchisees, vendors and employees.  A number of retailers and other companies have recently experienced serious cyber incidents and breaches of their information technology systems.  The Wendy’s system has also experienced unusual credit card activity at some Wendy’s restaurants, as further described below.  As the Company’s reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to its systems, both internal and those it has outsourced.  The three primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption, damage to the relationship with customers, franchisees and employees and private data exposure.  In addition to maintaining insurance coverage to address cyber incidents, the Company has also implemented processes, procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks.  However, these measures, as well as its increased awareness of a risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that the Company’s reputation and financial results will not be adversely affected by such an incident.Because the Company and its franchisees accept electronic forms of payment from their customers, the Company’s business requires the collection and retention of customer data, including credit and debit card numbers and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that the Company and its franchisees maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom the Company and its franchisees contract to provide credit card processing.  The Company also maintains important internal Company data, such as personally identifiable information about its employees and franchisees and information relating to its operations.  The Company’s use of personally identifiable information is regulated by foreign, federal and state laws, as well as by certain third-party agreements.  As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, the Company may incur additional costs to ensure that it remains in compliance with those laws and regulations.  If the Company’s security and information systems are compromised or if its employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws, regulations, or contract terms, and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect the Company’s reputation and could disrupt its operations and result in costly litigation, judgments, or penalties resulting from violation of federal and state laws and payment card industry regulations.  A cyber incident could also require the Company to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, increase fees payable to third parties, and incur penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect the operation of the Company’s business and results of operations. 20Certain of Our Franchisees have Experienced Cybersecurity Incidents.The Company first reported unusual payment card activity affecting some franchise-owned restaurants in February 2016 and that malware had been discovered on certain systems.  Subsequently, on June 9, 2016, the Company reported that an additional malware variant had been identified and disabled.  On July 7, 2016, the Company, on behalf of affected franchise locations, provided information about specific restaurant locations that may have been impacted by these attacks, all of which are located in the United States, along with support for customers who may have been affected by the malware variants.Working closely with third-party forensic experts, federal law enforcement and payment card industry contacts as part of its ongoing investigation, the Company determined that specific payment card information was targeted by the additional malware variant.  This information included cardholder name, credit or debit card number, expiration date, cardholder verification value and service code.The Company believes the criminal cyberattacks resulted from service providers’ remote access credentials being compromised, allowing access, and the ability to deploy malware, to some franchisees’ point-of-sale systems.  There has been no indication in the ongoing investigation that any Company-operated restaurants were impacted by this activity.The Company worked with investigators to disable the malware involved in the first attack earlier this year.  Soon after detecting the malware variant involved in the latest attack, the Company identified a method of disabling it and thereafter disabled it in all franchisee restaurants where it was discovered.  The investigation has confirmed that criminals used malware believed to have been effectively deployed on some Wendy’s franchisee systems starting in late fall 2015.The Company has been named as a defendant in a putative class action filed in the United States on behalf of customers, as well as five class actions brought by financial institutions in the United States that have been consolidated into a single proceeding.  In addition, certain of the Company’s present and former directors, and one non-director executive officer of the Company, were named as defendants in a putative shareholder derivative complaint alleging breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment and gross mismanagement.  These civil proceedings seek damages and other relief allegedly arising from the cybersecurity incident.  In addition, claims may also be made by payment card networks against the affected franchisees.  These claims and investigations may adversely affect how we or our franchisees operate the business, divert the attention of management from the operation of the business, have an adverse effect on our reputation, result in additional costs and adversely affect our results of operations.We may be required to recognize additional asset impairment and other asset-related charges.We have significant amounts of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets and have incurred impairment charges in the past with respect to those assets.  In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we test for impairment generally annually, or more frequently, if there are indicators of impairment, such as:•significant adverse changes in the business climate;•current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with long-lived assets;•a current expectation that more-likely-than-not (i.e., a likelihood that is more than 50%) long-lived assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life; and•a significant drop in our stock price.Based upon future economic and capital market conditions, as well as the operating performance of our reporting units, future impairment charges could be incurred.  Further, as a result of the system optimization initiative, the Company has recorded losses on remeasuring long-lived assets to fair value upon determination that the assets will be leased and/or subleased to franchisees in connection with the sale or anticipated sale of restaurants, and may incur further losses as the Company continues to sell restaurants under the system optimization initiative.The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions, and substantially all of the assets of certain subsidiaries are security, under the terms of a securitization transaction that was completed on June 1, 2015.On June 1, 2015, Wendy’s Funding, LLC (“Wendy’s Funding” or the “Master Issuer”), a limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of The Wendy’s Company, entered into a base indenture and a related supplemental indenture (collectively, the “Indenture”) under which the Master Issuer may issue multiple series of notes.  On the same date, the Master  21Issuer issued Series 2015-1 3.371% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I (the “Class A-2-I Notes”) with an initial principal amount of $875.0 million, Series 2015-1 4.080% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II (the “Class A-2-II Notes”) with an initial principal amount of $900.0 million and the Series 2015-1 4.497% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-III, (the “Class A-2-III Notes”) with an initial principal amount of $500.0 million (collectively, the “Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes”).  In addition, the Master Issuer entered into a revolving financing facility of Series 2015-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 (the “Series 2015-1 Class A-1 Notes” and, together with the Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes, the “Series 2015-1 Senior Notes”), which allow for the drawing of up to $150.0 million under the Series 2015-1 Class A-1 Notes, which include certain credit instruments, including a letter of credit facility.  The Series 2015-1 Class A-1 Notes were issued under the Indenture and allow for drawings on a revolving basis. The Series 2015-1 Senior Notes were issued in a securitization transaction pursuant to which certain of the Company’s domestic and foreign revenue-generating assets, consisting principally of franchise-related agreements, real estate assets, and intellectual property and license agreements for the use of intellectual property, were contributed or otherwise transferred to the Master Issuer and certain other limited-purpose, bankruptcy remote, wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company that act as guarantors (the “Guarantors”) of the Series 2015-1 Senior Notes and that have pledged substantially all of their assets, excluding certain real estate assets and subject to certain limitations, to secure the Series 2015-1 Senior Notes. The Series 2015-1 Senior Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including (i) that the Master Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Series 2015-1 Senior Notes, (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments in the case of the Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes under certain circumstances, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the assets pledged as collateral for the Series 2015-1 Senior Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters.  The Series 2015-1 Senior Notes are also subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service coverage ratios, the sum of global gross sales for specified restaurants being below certain levels on certain measurement dates, certain manager termination events, an event of default, and the failure to repay or refinance the Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes on the applicable scheduled maturity date.  The Series 2015-1 Senior Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal, or other amounts due on or with respect to the Series 2015-1 Senior Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective, and certain judgments.In the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the Indenture (including, without limitation, upon an event of default under the Indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the applicable term), the funds available to the Company would be reduced or eliminated, which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business.  If the Company’s subsidiaries are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations, they may need to refinance or restructure debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital.  If the Company’s subsidiaries are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, they may not be able to meet debt payment and other obligations.The Company has a significant amount of debt outstanding. Such indebtedness, along with the other contractual commitments of its subsidiaries, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to meet debt payment obligations.The Company has approximately $2.5 billion of outstanding debt, including debt issued in the securitization transaction on June 1, 2015.  Additionally, a subsidiary of the Company has issued the Series 2015-1 Class A-1 Notes, which will allow the subsidiary to borrow amounts from time to time on a revolving basis, up to an aggregate principal amount of $150.0 million.This level of debt could have significant consequences on the Company’s future operations, including:•making it more difficult to meet payment and other obligations under outstanding debt;•resulting in an event of default if the Company’s subsidiaries fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of the Company’s subsidiaries’ debt becoming immediately due and payable;•reducing the availability of the Company’s cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; 22•subjecting the Company to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on indebtedness with variable interest rates;•limiting the Company’s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing its vulnerability to, changes in the Company’s business, the industry in which it operates and the general economy; and•placing the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that are less leveraged.In addition, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries also have significant contractual requirements for the purchase of soft drinks.  If consumer preferences change and the Company’s customers purchase fewer soft drinks than expected or estimated, such contractual commitments may adversely affect the financial condition of the Company.  The Company has also provided loan guarantees to various lenders on behalf of franchisees entering into debt arrangements for new restaurant development and equipment financing, and two guarantees to lenders for franchisees, in connection with the refinancing of a franchisee’s debt and the sale of restaurants to a franchisee.  Certain subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have been indemnified.  In addition, certain subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have not been indemnified.  The Company has also provided an irrevocable stand-by letter of credit to a lender to support a financing program for franchisees that participate in the Company’s Image Activation Program.  These commitments could have an adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity and the ability of its subsidiaries to meet payment obligations.The ability to meet payment and other obligations under the debt instruments of the Company’s subsidiaries depends on their ability to generate significant cash flow in the future.  This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, as well as other factors that are beyond the Company’s control.  There can be no assurance that the Company’s business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to it under existing or any future credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable its subsidiaries to meet their debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs.  If the Company’s subsidiaries are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations, they may need to refinance or restructure debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital.  If the Company’s subsidiaries are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, they may not be able to meet debt payment and other obligations.In addition, the Company may incur additional indebtedness in the future.  If new debt or other liabilities are added to the Company’s current consolidated debt levels, the related risks that it now faces could intensify.The securitization transaction documents impose certain restrictions on the activities of the Company and its subsidiaries.The Indenture and the management agreement entered into between a subsidiary of the Company and the Indenture trustee (the “Management Agreement”) contain various covenants that limit the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to engage in specified types of transactions.  For example, the Indenture and the Management Agreement contain covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of certain subsidiaries to:•incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;•sell certain assets;•create or incur liens on certain assets to secure indebtedness; or•consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets.As a result of these restrictions, the Company may not have adequate resources or flexibility to continue to manage the business and provide for growth of the Wendy’s system, including product development and marketing for the Wendy’s brand, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future growth prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.To service debt and meet its other cash needs, Wendy’s will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be generated or available to it.The ability of Wendy’s to make payments on, repay or refinance its debt, including debt issued in the securitization transaction on June 1, 2015 and any additional debt, and to fund planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend largely upon its future operating performance.  Future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial,  23competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.  In addition, the ability of Wendy’s to borrow funds in the future to make payments on its debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in its credit facilities and other debt agreements, including those for the debt issued in the securitization transaction on June 1, 2015 and other agreements it may enter into in the future.  Specifically, Wendy’s will need to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests.  There is no assurance that the Wendy’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under its credit facilities or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its debt or to fund its or the Company’s dividend and other liquidity needs.There can be no assurance regarding whether or to what extent the Company will pay dividends on its Common Stock in the future.Holders of the Company’s Common Stock will only be entitled to receive such dividends as its Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments.  Any dividends will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the Company’s earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time.Because the Company is a holding company, its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent upon cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand and cash flows from its subsidiaries.  The ability of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends and/or make loans or advances to the holding company will be dependent upon their respective abilities to achieve sufficient cash flows after satisfying their respective cash requirements, including subsidiary-level debt service and revolving credit agreements, to enable the payment of such dividends or the making of such loans or advances.  The ability of any of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or other payments to the Company will also be limited by restrictions in debt instruments currently existing or subsequently entered into by such subsidiaries, which is described earlier in this Item 1A.A substantial amount of the Company’s Common Stock is concentrated in the hands of certain stockholders.Nelson Peltz, the Company’s Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, Peter May, the Company’s Vice Chairman and former President and Chief Operating Officer, and Edward Garden, who resigned as a director of the Company on December 14, 2015, beneficially own shares of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock that collectively constitute more than 20% of its total voting power as of February 22, 2017.  Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden may, from time to time, acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of Common Stock.On December 1, 2011, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Trian Agreement”) with Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden, and several of their affiliates (the “Covered Persons”).  Pursuant to the Trian Agreement, the Board of Directors, including a majority of the independent directors, approved, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“Section 203”), the Covered Persons becoming the owners (as defined in Section 203(c)(9) of the DGCL) of or acquiring an aggregate of up to (and including), but not more than, 32.5% (subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Agreement) of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock, such that no such persons would be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 203 solely as a result of such ownership (such approval, the “Section 203 Approval”).The Trian Agreement (other than the provisions relating to the Section 203 Approval and certain miscellaneous provisions that survive the termination of the agreement) terminated pursuant to the termination provisions of the Trian Agreement after funds affiliated with the Covered Persons sold 16.2 million shares of the Company’s Common Stock on January 15, 2014, thereby decreasing the Covered Persons’ beneficial ownership to less than 25% of the outstanding voting power of the Company as of that date.  The terminated provisions of the Trian Agreement included provisions restricting the Covered Persons in the following areas: (i) beneficial ownership of Company voting securities; (ii) solicitation of proxies or submission of a proposal for the vote of stockholders under certain circumstances; (iii) certain affiliate transactions with the Company; and (iv) voting of certain Company voting securities.This concentration of ownership gives Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden significant influence over the outcome of actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets.  They are also in a position to have significant influence to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.  If in the future Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden were to acquire more than a majority of the Company’s outstanding voting power, they would be able to determine the outcome of the election of members of the Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring majority stockholder approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets.  They would also be in a position to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company. 24The Company’s certificate of incorporation contains certain anti-takeover provisions and permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and limits its ability to raise capital from affiliates.Certain provisions in the Company’s certificate of incorporation are intended to discourage or delay a hostile takeover of control of the Company.  The Company’s certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of “blank check” preferred stock, which will have such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.  Accordingly, the Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of its common stock.  The preferred stock could be used to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that is determined by the Board of Directors to be undesirable.  Although the Company has no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock, it cannot assure that it will not do so in the future.The Company’s certificate of incorporation prohibits the issuance of preferred stock to affiliates, unless offered ratably to the holders of the Company’s Common Stock, subject to an exception in the event that the Company is in financial distress and the issuance is approved by its audit committee.  This prohibition limits the ability to raise capital from affiliates"
11,WEN,WENDY'S CO,2016-03-03,"Risk Factors
.We wish to caution readers that in addition to the important factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we have included below the most significant factors that have affected, or in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results during fiscal 2016, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.Our success depends in part upon the continued retention of certain key personnel.The Company announced on October 5, 2015 that President and Chief Executive Officer Emil Brolick planned to retire from management duties with the Company in May 2016.  The Company also announced that Mr. Brolick was expected to be succeeded by current Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and International Todd Penegor.  On January 4, 2016, Mr. Penegor assumed the position of President of the Company.  Mr. Brolick is expected to continue as Chief Executive Officer until the transition of Mr. Penegor’s duties as Chief Financial Officer has occurred, which is expected by May 2016.  Mr. Brolick is also expected to continue to serve on the Board of Directors upon his retirement to ensure continuity of leadership and strategic focus for the Company.The Company is currently conducting an external search for a Chief Financial Officer to succeed Mr. Penegor.As President, Mr. Penegor will maintain his current responsibilities for finance, restaurant development, information technology and international, and will assume responsibility for operations, which will continue to be led by Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer Robert D. Wright.We believe that over time our success has been dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management team.  The failure by us to retain members of our senior management team in the future could adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts we have undertaken to increase the efficiency and profitability of our business.Competition from other restaurant companies, or poor customer experience at Wendy’s restaurants, could hurt our brand.The market segments in which company-owned and franchised Wendy’s restaurants compete are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, price, food quality and presentation, service, location, convenience, and the nature and condition of the restaurant facility.  If customers have a poor experience at a Wendy’s restaurant, whether at a company-owned or franchised restaurant, we may experience a decrease in guest traffic.  Further, Wendy’s restaurants compete with a variety of locally-owned restaurants, as well as competitive regional and national chains and franchises.  Several of these chains compete by offering menu items that are targeted at certain consumer groups or dietary trends.  Additionally, many of our competitors have introduced lower cost, value meal menu options.  Our revenues and those of our franchisees may be hurt by this product and price competition.Moreover, new companies, including operators outside the quick-service restaurant industry, may enter our market areas and target our customer base.  For example, additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases have come from deli sections and in-store cafes of a number of major grocery store chains, as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets.  Such competitors may have, among other things, lower operating costs, better locations, better facilities, better management, better products, more effective marketing and more efficient operations.  Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing and marketing strategies in the quick-service restaurant industry better than we can.  Many of our competitors spend significantly more on advertising and marketing than we do, which may give them a competitive advantage through higher levels of brand awareness among consumers.  All such competition may adversely affect our revenues and profits by reducing revenues of company-owned restaurants and royalty revenue from franchised restaurants. 12Changes in consumer tastes and preferences, and in discretionary consumer spending, could result in a decline in sales at company-owned restaurants and in the royalties that we receive from franchisees.The quick-service restaurant industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions, discretionary spending priorities, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants.  Our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income.  Accordingly, we may experience declines in sales during economic downturns.  Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending or a decline in consumer food-away-from-home spending could hurt our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.If company-owned and franchised restaurants are unable to adapt to changes in consumer preferences and trends, company-owned and franchised restaurants may lose customers and the resulting revenues from company-owned restaurants and the royalties that we receive from franchisees may decline.Disruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.Disruptions in the national and global economies could result in higher unemployment rates and declines in consumer confidence and spending.  If such disruptions occur, they may result in significant declines in consumer food-away-from-home spending and customer traffic in our restaurants and those of our franchisees.  There can be no assurance that government responses to the disruptions will restore consumer confidence.  Ongoing disruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.Changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken and corn), supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs could harm results of operations.Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken and corn), supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs.  Commodity cost pressures, and any increase in these costs, especially beef or chicken prices, could adversely affect future operating results.  In addition, our business is susceptible to increases in these costs as a result of other factors beyond its control, such as weather conditions, global demand, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulations.  Further, prices for feed ingredients used to produce beef and chicken could be adversely affected by changes in global weather patterns, which are inherently unpredictable, and by federal ethanol policy.  Increases in gasoline prices could result in the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors, which would increase our costs.  Significant increases in gasoline prices could also result in a decrease in customer traffic at our restaurants, which could adversely affect our business.  We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results.  In addition, we may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to our customers.Shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of perishable food products could damage the Wendy’s brand reputation and adversely affect our sales and operating results.Wendy’s and its franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet brand specifications.  Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, disease or food-borne illnesses, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which could lower our revenues, increase operating costs, damage brand reputation and otherwise harm our business and the businesses of our franchisees.Food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. Coli) involving Wendy’s or its supply chain, could create negative publicity and adversely affect sales and operating results.Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe, quality food products.  However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. Coli), have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future.Food safety events could adversely affect the price and availability of beef, poultry or other meats.  As a result, Wendy’s restaurants could experience a significant increase in food costs if there are food safety events whether or not such events involve Wendy’s restaurants or restaurants of competitors. 13In addition, food safety events, whether or not involving Wendy’s, could result in negative publicity for Wendy’s or for the industry or market segments in which we operate.  Increased use of social media could create and/or amplify the effects of negative publicity.  This negative publicity, as well as any other negative publicity concerning types of food products Wendy’s serves, may reduce demand for Wendy’s food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types.  A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could result in a decline in sales and operating results at company-owned restaurants or in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.Consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of beef, poultry, french fries or other products we sell, concerns regarding the ingredients in our products and/or cooking processes used in our restaurants, or concerns regarding the effects of disease outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics could affect demand for our products.Consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of beef, poultry, french fries or other products we sell, concerns regarding the ingredients in our products and/or cooking processes used in our restaurants, or concerns regarding the effects of disease outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics could result in less demand for our products and a decline in sales at company-owned restaurants and in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.Increased use of social media could create and/or amplify the effects of negative publicity and adversely affect sales and operating results.Events reported in the media, including social media, whether or not accurate or involving Wendy’s, could create and/or amplify negative publicity for Wendy’s or for the industry or market segments in which we operate.  This could reduce demand for Wendy’s food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types.  A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of negative publicity from social media could result in a decline in sales and operating results at company-owned restaurants or in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.Growth of our restaurant business is dependent on new restaurant openings, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.Our restaurant business derives earnings from sales at company-owned restaurants, franchise royalties received from franchised restaurants and franchise fees from franchise restaurant operators for each new unit opened.  Growth in our restaurant revenues and earnings is dependent on new restaurant openings.  Numerous factors beyond our control may affect restaurant openings.  These factors include but are not limited to:•our ability to attract new franchisees;•the availability of site locations for new restaurants;•the ability of potential restaurant owners to obtain financing;•the ability of restaurant owners to hire, train and retain qualified operating personnel;•construction and development costs of new restaurants, particularly in highly-competitive markets;•the ability of restaurant owners to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all; and•adverse weather conditions.Wendy’s franchisees could take actions that could harm our business.Wendy’s franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with the standards set forth in agreements with them.  Wendy’s also provides training and support to franchisees.  However, franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and the franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants.  Specifically, franchisees are solely responsible for developing and utilizing their own policies, procedures and documents, making their own hiring, firing and disciplinary decisions, scheduling hours and establishing wages, and managing their day-to-day employment processes and procedures, all of which is done independent of Wendy’s and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules or regulations.  Further, franchisees have discretion as to the prices charged to customers.  As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee.  If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with required standards, then royalty payments to us could be adversely affected and the brand’s image and reputation could be harmed, both of which in turn could hurt our business and operating results. 14Our success depends on franchisees’ participation in brand strategies.Wendy’s franchisees are an integral part of our business.  Wendy’s may be unable to successfully implement the strategies that it believes are necessary for further growth if franchisees do not participate in that implementation.  Our business and operating results could be adversely affected if a significant number of franchisees do not participate in brand strategies.Our Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at company-owned and participating franchised restaurants or improve our results of operations.Throughout 2016, the Company expects Wendy’s and its franchisees to reimage approximately 430 existing company-owned and franchised restaurants and open approximately 110 new company-owned and franchised restaurants under its Image Activation program, with plans for significantly more new and reimaged Company and franchisee restaurants in 2017 and beyond.In order to promote Image Activation new restaurant development, Wendy’s has an incentive program for franchisees that provides for reductions in royalty payments for the first three years of operation for qualifying new restaurants opened by December 31, 2016.  Wendy’s also has incentive programs for franchisees that commence Image Activation restaurant remodels during 2016 and 2017.  The remodel incentive programs provide reductions in royalty payments for one year or two years after the completion of construction depending upon the type of remodel.  In 2015, Wendy’s added an additional incentive to the 2016 remodel program described above to include waiving the franchise agreement renewal fee for certain types of remodels.  In addition, Wendy’s had incentive programs that included reductions in royalty payments in 2015 and 2014 as well as cash incentives for franchisees’ participation in Wendy’s Image Activation program throughout 2014 and 2013.  These incentives will result in a reduction of royalties or other revenues received from franchisees during the periods covered.In addition to the Image Activation incentive programs described above, Wendy’s executed an agreement to partner with a third-party lender to establish a financing program for franchisees that participate in our Image Activation program.  Under the program, the lender is providing loans to franchisees to be used for the reimaging of restaurants according to the guidelines and specifications under the Image Activation program.  To support the program, Wendy’s has provided to the lender a $6.0 million irrevocable stand-by letter of credit. The Company’s Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at company-owned restaurants or improve results of operations.  There can be no assurance that sales at participating franchised restaurants will achieve or maintain projected levels or that after giving effect to the incentives provided to franchisees the Company’s results of operations will improve.Further, it is possible that Wendy’s may provide other financial incentives to franchisees to participate in the Image Activation program.  These incentives could also result in additional expense and/or a reduction of royalties or other revenues received from franchisees in the future.  If Wendy’s provides additional incentives to franchisees related to financing of the Image Activation program, Wendy’s may incur costs related to loan guarantees, interest rate subsidies and/or costs related to collectability of loans.In addition, most of the Wendy’s system consists of franchised restaurants.  Many of our franchisees will need to borrow funds in order to participate in the Image Activation program.  Other than the incentive programs described above, Wendy’s generally does not provide franchisees with financing but it continues to develop third-party financing sources for franchisees.  If our franchisees are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or not at all, they may be unwilling or unable to invest in the reimaging of their existing restaurants and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our financial results are affected by the operating results of franchisees.As of January 3, 2016, approximately 90% of the Wendy’s system were franchise restaurants.  We receive revenue in the form of royalties, which are generally based on a percentage of sales at franchised restaurants, rent and fees from franchisees.  Accordingly, a substantial portion of our financial results is to a large extent dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees.  If sales trends or economic conditions worsen for franchisees, their financial results may worsen and our royalty, rent and other fee revenues may decline.  In addition, accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts may increase.  When company-owned restaurants are sold, one of our subsidiaries is often required to remain responsible for lease payments for these restaurants to the extent that the purchasing franchisees default on their leases.  During periods of declining sales and profitability of franchisees, the incidence of franchisee defaults for these lease payments increases and we are then required to make those payments and seek recourse against the franchisee or agree to repayment terms.  Additionally, if franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements, or if we decide to restructure franchise agreements in order to induce franchisees to renew these agreements, then our royalty revenues may decrease.  Further, we may decide from time to time to acquire restaurants from franchisees that experience significant financial hardship, which may reduce our cash and cash equivalents. 15The system optimization initiative involves risks that could adversely affect our business and financial results.In July 2013, the Company announced a system optimization initiative, as part of its brand transformation, which includes a shift from company-owned restaurants to franchised restaurants over time, through acquisitions and dispositions, as well as helping to facilitate franchisee-to-franchisee restaurant transfers.  In February 2015, the Company announced plans to sell approximately 540 additional restaurants to franchisees and reduce its ongoing company-owned restaurant ownership to approximately 5% of the total system by the end of 2016.  The Company expects to complete its plan to reduce its company-owned restaurant ownership to approximately 5% with the sale of approximately 315 restaurants during 2016.  There are a number of risks associated with the system optimization initiative, including the difficulty in predicting the ultimate costs associated with the sale of restaurants, employee termination costs, the timing of payments made and received, the results of negotiations with landlords, the impact of the sale of restaurants on ongoing operations, any tax impact from the sale of restaurants, and the future impact to the Company’s earnings, restaurant operating margin, cash flow and depreciation.  If Wendy’s is unable to manage these risks effectively, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.Further, Wendy’s generally retains ownership or the leasehold interest to the real estate when it sells restaurants under the system optimization initiative and leases or subleases the real estate to franchisees.  This increases the risks described above under the heading “Our financial results are affected by the operating results of franchisees.”Wendy’s may be unable to manage effectively the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.Wendy’s has from time to time acquired the interests of and sold Wendy’s restaurants to franchisees.  Wendy’s will continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions of franchised restaurants and strategic dispositions of company-owned restaurants to existing and new franchisees.  The success of these transactions is dependent upon the availability of sellers and buyers, the availability of financing, and the brand’s ability to negotiate transactions on terms deemed acceptable.  In addition, the operations of restaurants that the brand acquires may not be integrated successfully, and the intended benefits of such transactions may not be realized.  Acquisitions of franchised restaurants pose various risks to brand operations, including:•diversion of management’s attention to the integration of acquired restaurant operations;•increased operating expenses and the inability to achieve expected cost savings and operating efficiencies;•exposure to liabilities arising out of sellers’ prior operations of acquired restaurants; and•incurrence or assumption of debt to finance acquisitions or improvements and/or the assumption of long-term, non-cancelable leases.In addition, engaging in acquisitions and dispositions places increased demands on the brand’s operational and financial management resources and may require us to continue to expand these resources.  If Wendy’s is unable to manage the acquisition and disposition of restaurants effectively, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.Current restaurant locations may become unattractive, and attractive new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all.The success of any restaurant depends in substantial part on its location.  There can be no assurance that our current restaurant locations will continue to be attractive as demographic patterns change.  Neighborhood or economic conditions where our restaurants are located could decline in the future, thus resulting in potentially reduced sales in those locations.  In addition, rising real estate prices in some areas may restrict our ability and the ability of franchisees to purchase or lease new desirable locations.  If desirable locations cannot be obtained at reasonable prices, the brand’s ability to execute its growth strategies could be adversely affected.Wendy’s leasing and ownership of significant amounts of real estate exposes it to possible liabilities and losses, including liabilities associated with environmental matters.As of January 3, 2016, Wendy’s leased or owned the land and/or the building for 632 company-owned Wendy’s restaurants.  Wendy’s also owned 340 and leased 720 properties that were either leased or subleased principally to franchisees as of January 3, 2016.  Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate.  In particular, the value of our real property assets could decrease, and costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends, supply or demand for the use of the restaurants, which may result from competition from similar restaurants in the area, and liability for environmental matters. 16Wendy’s is subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances.  These environmental laws provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner, operator or occupant of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances.  Third parties may also make claims against owners, operators or occupants of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such substances.  A number of our restaurant sites were formerly gas stations or are adjacent to current or former gas stations, or were used for other commercial activities that can create environmental impacts.  We may also acquire or lease these types of sites in the future.  We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of all of our properties.  We may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our leased and owned properties, and any such liabilities identified in the future could cause us to incur significant costs, including costs associated with litigation, fines or clean-up responsibilities.  In addition, we cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted.  We cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with any environmental laws or regulations or to satisfy any such claims.  See “Item 1. Business - General - Legal and Environmental Matters.”Wendy’s leases real property generally for initial terms of 15 to 20 years with one or more options to extend the term of the leases in consecutive five-year increments.  Many leases provide that the landlord may increase the rent over the term of the lease and any renewals thereof.  Most leases require us to pay all of the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities.  We generally cannot cancel these leases.  If an existing or future restaurant is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term.  In addition, as each lease expires, we may fail to negotiate additional renewals or renewal options, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close restaurants in desirable locations.Due to the concentration of Wendy’s restaurants in particular geographic regions, our business results could be impacted by the adverse economic conditions prevailing in those regions regardless of the state of the national economy as a whole.As of January 3, 2016, we and our franchisees operated Wendy’s restaurants in 50 states, the District of Columbia and 28 foreign countries and territories.  As of January 3, 2016 and as detailed in “Item 2. Properties,” the 8 leading states by number of operating units were: Florida, Ohio, Texas, Georgia, California, Michigan, Pennsylvania and North Carolina.  This geographic concentration can cause economic conditions in particular areas of the country to have a disproportionate impact on our overall results of operations.  It is possible that adverse economic conditions in states or regions that contain a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the future.Our operations are influenced by adverse weather conditions.Weather, which is unpredictable, can impact Wendy’s restaurant sales.  Harsh weather conditions that keep customers from dining out result in lost opportunities for our restaurants.  A heavy snowstorm in the Northeast or Midwest or a hurricane in the Southeast can shut down an entire metropolitan area, resulting in a reduction in sales in that area.  Our first quarter includes winter months and historically has a lower level of sales at company-owned restaurants.  Because a significant portion of our restaurant operating costs is fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of sales during these periods hurts our operating margins, and can result in restaurant operating losses.  For these reasons, a quarter-to-quarter comparison may not be a good indication of Wendy’s performance or how it may perform in the future.Our business could be hurt by increased labor costs or labor shortages.Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our company-owned restaurants.  We devote significant resources to recruiting and training its managers and hourly employees.  Increased labor costs due to competition, increased minimum wage or employee benefits costs (including various federal, state and local actions to increase minimum wages and government-mandated health care benefits), unionization activity or other factors would adversely impact our cost of sales and operating expenses.  In addition, Wendy’s success depends on its ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and staff.  If the brand is unable to do so, our results of operations could be adversely affected.Complaints or litigation may hurt the Wendy’s brand.Wendy’s customers file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to a Wendy’s restaurant, or alleging that there was a problem with food quality or operations at a Wendy’s restaurant.  We are also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims from franchisees (which tend to increase when franchisees experience declining sales and profitability)  17and claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, including class action lawsuits related to these matters.  The Company has also been named as a defendant in the matter described in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.”  Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management’s attention away from operations and hurt our performance.  We cannot estimate the aggregate possible range of loss due to most proceedings being in preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur, and significant factual matters unresolved.  In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties.  Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions are thus inherently difficult.  A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.  Further, adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt us and our franchisees.Additionally, the restaurant industry has been subject to a number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have contributed to the obesity of certain of their customers.  Adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may harm the reputation of our restaurants, even if the allegations are not directed against our restaurants or are not valid, and even if we are not found liable or the concerns relate only to a single restaurant or a limited number of restaurants.  Moreover, complaints, litigation or adverse publicity experienced by one or more of Wendy’s franchisees could also hurt our business as a whole.We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of the Wendy’s brand and hurt our business.Our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business.  We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and other intellectual property.  The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both existing and new markets.  If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property, either in print or on the Internet, the value of our brand may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the failure of our brand to achieve and maintain market acceptance.  This could harm our image, brand or competitive position and, if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, cause us to incur significant legal fees.We franchise our brand to various franchisees.  While we try to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by all of our franchisees, we cannot assure that these franchisees will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property or the reputation of the Wendy’s restaurant system.We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions.  The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the United States in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries.  We cannot assure that all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate.  The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.In addition, we cannot assure that third parties will not claim infringement by us in the future.  Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause delays in introducing new menu items, require costly modifications to advertising and promotional materials or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.  As a result, any such claim could harm our business and cause a decline in our results of operations and financial condition.Our current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims that may be filed.We currently maintain insurance we believe is adequate for businesses of our size and type.  However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters or acts of terrorism. In addition, we currently self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under workers compensation, general liability and property insurance programs.  Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs, which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 18Changes in legal or regulatory requirements, including franchising laws, payment card industry rules, overtime rules, minimum wage rates, government-mandated health care benefits, tax legislation, federal ethanol policy and accounting standards, may adversely affect our ability to open new restaurants or otherwise hurt our existing and future operations and results.Each Wendy’s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, safety and other agencies in the state and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located, as well as to Federal laws, rules and regulations and requirements of non-governmental entities such as payment card industry rules.  State and local government authorities may enact laws, rules or regulations that impact restaurant operations and the cost of conducting those operations.  There can be no assurance that we and/or our franchisees will not experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants, which could delay the opening of such restaurants in the future.  In addition, more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to tax, zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.Federal laws, rules and regulations address many aspects of our business, such as franchising, federal ethanol policy, minimum wages and taxes.  We and our franchisees are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, along with the ADA, family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted by the states that govern these and other employment law matters.  Changes in laws, rules, regulations and governmental policies, including the joint employer standard, could increase our costs and adversely affect our existing and future operations and results.Changes in government-mandated health care benefits under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) are anticipated to continue to increase our costs and the costs of our franchisees.  Our compliance with the PPACA resulted in significant modifications to our benefits policies and practices.  Because we experienced modest enrollment and participation in our health plans by newly full-time employees in 2015, the cost increases did not result in modifications to our business practices.  However, future cost increases could be material and any future compliance-related modifications to our benefits policies and practices, or to our business practices, could be disruptive to our operations and impact our ability to attract and retain personnel.Changes in accounting standards, or in the interpretation of existing standards, applicable to us could also affect our future results.We do not exercise ultimate control over purchasing for our restaurant system, which could harm sales or profitability and the brand.Although we ensure that all suppliers to the Wendy’s system meet quality control standards, Wendy’s franchisees control the purchasing of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies from such suppliers through the purchasing co-op controlled by Wendy’s franchisees, QSCC.  QSCC negotiates national contracts for such food, equipment and supplies.  We are entitled to appoint two representatives (of the total of 11) on the board of directors of QSCC and participates in QSCC through its company-owned restaurants, but we do not control the decisions and activities of QSCC except to ensure that all suppliers satisfy our quality control standards.  If QSCC does not properly estimate the product needs of the Wendy’s system, makes poor purchasing decisions, or decides to cease its operations, system sales and operating costs could be adversely affected and our results of operations and financial condition or the financial condition of Wendy’s franchisees could be hurt.Our international operations are subject to various factors of uncertainty and there is no assurance that international operations will be profitable.In addition to many of the risk factors described throughout this Item 1A, Wendy’s business outside of the United States is subject to a number of additional factors, including international economic and political conditions, risk of corruption and violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws of other countries, differing cultures and consumer preferences, the inability to adapt to international customer preferences, inadequate brand infrastructure within foreign countries to support our international activities, inability to obtain adequate supplies meeting our quality standards and product specifications or interruptions in obtaining such supplies, restrictions on our ability to move cash out of certain foreign countries, currency regulations and fluctuations, diverse government regulations and tax systems, uncertain or differing interpretations of rights and obligations in connection with international franchise agreements and the collection of royalties from international franchisees, the availability and cost of land, construction costs, other legal, financial or regulatory impediments to the development and/or operation of new restaurants, and the availability of experienced management, appropriate franchisees, and joint venture partners.  Although we believe we have developed the support structure required for international growth, there is no assurance that such growth will occur or that international operations will be profitable. 19To the extent we invest in international company-operated restaurants or joint ventures, we would also have the risk of operating losses related to those restaurants, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are heavily dependent on computer systems and information technology and any material failure, interruption or security breach of our computer systems or technology could impair our ability to efficiently operate our business.We are significantly dependent upon our computer systems and information technology to properly conduct our business, including point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures.  Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems and information technology.  The failure of these systems and information technology to operate effectively, an interruption, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems, fraudulent manipulation of sales reporting from our franchised restaurants resulting in loss of sales and royalty payments, or a breach in security of these systems could be harmful and cause delays in customer service, result in the loss of data and reduce efficiency or cause delays in operations.  Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any problems.  Any security breach involving our or our franchisees’ point-of-sale or other systems could result in a loss of consumer confidence and potential costs associated with fraud.  Also, despite our considerable efforts and technological resources to secure our computer systems and information technology, security breaches, such as unauthorized access and computer viruses, may occur, resulting in system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  A security breach of our computer systems or information technology could require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, and incur penalties or other costs that could adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations.As part of our marketing efforts, we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain customers.  These efforts may not be successful, and pose a variety of other risks, including the improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about the Wendy’s brand, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud or out of date information.  The inappropriate use of social media vehicles by franchisees, customers, or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.  The occurrence of any such developments could have an adverse effect on business results.The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in cybersecurity, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of confidential information, and/or damage to our employee and business relationships, all of which could subject us to loss and harm the Wendy’s brand.A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of information resources.  More specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data or steal confidential information about customers, franchisees, vendors and employees.  A number of retailers and other companies have recently experienced serious cyber incidents and breaches of their information technology systems.  The Company is also investigating unusual credit card activity at some Wendy’s restaurants, as further described below.  As the Company’s reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to its systems, both internal and those it has outsourced.  The three primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption, damage to the relationship with customers, franchisees and employees and private data exposure.  In addition to maintaining insurance coverage to address cyber incidents, the Company has also implemented processes, procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks.  However, these measures, as well as its increased awareness of a risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that the Company’s reputation and financial results will not be adversely affected by such an incident.Because the Company and its franchisees accept electronic forms of payment from their customers, the Company’s business requires the collection and retention of customer data, including credit and debit card numbers and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that the Company and its franchisees maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom the Company and its franchisees contract to provide credit card processing.  The Company also maintains important internal Company data, such as personally identifiable information about its employees and franchisees and information relating to its operations.  The Company’s use of personally identifiable information is regulated by foreign, federal and state laws, as well as by certain third-party agreements.  As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, the Company may incur additional costs to ensure that it remains in compliance with those laws and regulations.  If the Company’s security and information systems are compromised or if its employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws, regulations, or contract terms, and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect the Company’s reputation and could disrupt its operations and result in costly litigation, judgments, or penalties resulting from violation of federal and state laws and payment card industry regulations.  A cyber incident could also require the Company to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, increase fees payable to third parties, and incur penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect the operation of the Company’s business and results of operations. 20As reported in the news media in late January, the Company has engaged cybersecurity experts to conduct a comprehensive investigation into unusual credit card activity at some Wendy’s restaurants.  Out of the locations investigated to date, some have been found by the cybersecurity experts to have malware on a certain system.  The investigation is ongoing and the Company is continuing to work closely with cybersecurity experts and law enforcement officials.We may be required to recognize additional asset impairment and other asset-related charges.We have significant amounts of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets and have incurred impairment charges in the past with respect to those assets.  In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we test for impairment generally annually, or more frequently, if there are indicators of impairment, such as:•significant adverse changes in the business climate;•current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with long-lived assets;•a current expectation that more-likely-than-not (i.e., a likelihood that is more than 50%) long-lived assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life; and•a significant drop in our stock price.Based upon future economic and capital market conditions, as well as the operating performance of our reporting units, future impairment charges could be incurred.  Further, as a result of the system optimization initiative, the Company has recorded losses on remeasuring long-lived assets to fair value upon determination that the assets will be leased and/or subleased to franchisees in connection with the sale or anticipated sale of restaurants, and may incur further losses as the Company continues to sell restaurants under the system optimization initiative.The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions, and substantially all of the assets of certain subsidiaries are security, under the terms of a securitization transaction that was completed on June 1, 2015.On June 1, 2015, Wendy’s Funding, LLC (“Wendy’s Funding” or the “Master Issuer”), a limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of The Wendy’s Company, entered into a base indenture and a related supplemental indenture (collectively, the “Indenture”) under which the Master Issuer may issue multiple series of notes.  On the same date, the Master Issuer issued Series 2015-1 3.371% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I (the “Class A-2-I Notes”) with an initial principal amount of $875.0 million, Series 2015-1 4.080% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II (the “Class A-2-II Notes”) with an initial principal amount of $900.0 million and the Series 2015-1 4.497% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-III, (the “Class A-2-III Notes”) with an initial principal amount of $500.0 million (collectively, the “Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes”).  In addition, the Master Issuer entered into a revolving financing facility of Series 2015-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 (the “Series 2015-1 Class A-1 Notes” and, together with the Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes, the “Series 2015-1 Senior Notes”), which allow for the drawing of up to $150.0 million under the Series 2015-1 Class A-1 Notes, which include certain credit instruments, including a letter of credit facility.  The Series 2015-1 Class A-1 Notes were issued under the Indenture and allow for drawings on a revolving basis. The Series 2015-1 Senior Notes were issued in a securitization transaction pursuant to which certain of the Company’s domestic and foreign revenue-generating assets, consisting principally of franchise-related agreements, real estate assets, and intellectual property and license agreements for the use of intellectual property, were contributed or otherwise transferred to the Master Issuer and certain other limited-purpose, bankruptcy remote, wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company that act as guarantors (the “Guarantors”) of the Series 2015-1 Senior Notes and that have pledged substantially all of their assets, excluding certain real estate assets and subject to certain limitations, to secure the Series 2015-1 Senior Notes. The Series 2015-1 Senior Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including (i) that the Master Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Series 2015-1 Senior Notes, (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments in the case of the Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes under certain circumstances, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the assets pledged as collateral for the Series 2015-1 Senior Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters. The Series 2015-1 Senior Notes are also subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service coverage ratios, the sum of global gross sales for specified restaurants being below certain levels on certain measurement dates, certain manager termination events, an event of default, and the failure  21to repay or refinance the Series 2015-1 Class A-2 Notes on the applicable scheduled maturity date.  The Series 2015-1 Senior Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal, or other amounts due on or with respect to the Series 2015-1 Senior Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective, and certain judgments.In the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the Indenture (including, without limitation, upon an event of default under the Indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the applicable term), the funds available to the Company would be reduced or eliminated, which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business.  If the Company’s subsidiaries are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations, they may need to refinance or restructure debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital.  If the Company’s subsidiaries are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, they may not be able to meet debt payment and other obligations.The Company has a significant amount of debt outstanding. Such indebtedness, along with the other contractual commitments of its subsidiaries, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to meet debt payment obligations.The Company has approximately $2.4 billion of outstanding debt, including debt issued in the securitization transaction on June 1, 2015.  Additionally, a subsidiary of the Company has issued the Series 2015-1 Class A-1 Notes, which will allow the subsidiary to borrow amounts from time to time on a revolving basis, up to an aggregate principal amount of $150.0 million.This level of debt could have significant consequences on the Company’s future operations, including:•making it more difficult to meet payment and other obligations under outstanding debt;•resulting in an event of default if the Company’s subsidiaries fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of the Company’s subsidiaries’ debt becoming immediately due and payable;•reducing the availability of the Company’s cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;•subjecting the Company to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on indebtedness with variable interest rates;•limiting the Company’s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing its vulnerability to, changes in the Company’s business, the industry in which it operates and the general economy; and•placing the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that are less leveraged.In addition, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries also have significant contractual requirements for the purchase of soft drinks.  If consumer preferences change and the Company’s customers purchase fewer soft drinks than expected or estimated, such contractual commitments may adversely affect the financial condition of the Company.  The Company has also provided loan guarantees to various lenders on behalf of franchisees entering into debt arrangements for new restaurant development and equipment financing, and two guarantees to lenders for franchisees, in connection with the refinancing of a franchisee’s debt and the sale of restaurants to a franchisee.  Certain subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have been indemnified.  In addition, certain subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have not been indemnified.  The Company has also provided an irrevocable stand-by letter of credit to a lender to support a financing program for franchisees that participate in the Company’s Image Activation Program.  These commitments could have an adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity and the ability of its subsidiaries to meet payment obligations.The ability to meet payment and other obligations under the debt instruments of the Company’s subsidiaries depends on their ability to generate significant cash flow in the future.  This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, as well as other factors that are beyond the Company’s control.  There can be no assurance that the Company’s business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to it under existing or any future credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable its subsidiaries to meet their debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs.  If the Company’s subsidiaries are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt  22obligations, they may need to refinance or restructure debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital.  If the Company’s subsidiaries are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, they may not be able to meet debt payment and other obligations.In addition, the Company may incur additional indebtedness in the future.  If new debt or other liabilities are added to the Company’s current consolidated debt levels, the related risks that it now faces could intensify.The securitization transaction documents impose certain restrictions on the activities of the Company and its subsidiaries.The Indenture and the management agreement entered into between a subsidiary of the Company and the Indenture trustee (the “Management Agreement”) contain various covenants that limit the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to engage in specified types of transactions.  For example, the Indenture and the Management Agreement contain covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of certain subsidiaries to:•incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;•sell certain assets;•create or incur liens on certain assets to secure indebtedness; or•consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets.As a result of these restrictions, the Company may not have adequate resources or flexibility to continue to manage the business and provide for growth of the Wendy’s system, including product development and marketing for the Wendy’s brand, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s future growth prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.To service debt and meet its other cash needs, Wendy’s will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be generated or available to it.The ability of Wendy’s to make payments on, repay or refinance its debt, including debt issued in the securitization transaction on June 1, 2015 and any additional debt, and to fund planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend largely upon its future operating performance.  Future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.  In addition, the ability of Wendy’s to borrow funds in the future to make payments on its debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in its credit facilities and other debt agreements, including those for the debt issued in the securitization transaction on June 1, 2015 and other agreements it may enter into in the future.  Specifically, Wendy’s will need to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests.  There is no assurance that the Wendy’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under its credit facilities or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its debt or to fund its or the Company’s dividend and other liquidity needs.There can be no assurance regarding whether or to what extent the Company will pay dividends on its Common Stock in the future.Holders of the Company’s Common Stock will only be entitled to receive such dividends as its Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments.  Any dividends will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the Company’s earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time.Because the Company is a holding company, its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent upon cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand and cash flows from its subsidiaries.  The ability of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends and/or make loans or advances to the holding company will be dependent upon their respective abilities to achieve sufficient cash flows after satisfying their respective cash requirements, including subsidiary-level debt service and revolving credit agreements, to enable the payment of such dividends or the making of such loans or advances.  The ability of any of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or other payments to the Company will also be limited by restrictions in debt instruments currently existing or subsequently entered into by such subsidiaries, which is described earlier in this Item 1A. 23A substantial amount of the Company’s Common Stock is concentrated in the hands of certain stockholders.Nelson Peltz, the Company’s Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, Peter May, the Company’s Vice Chairman and former President and Chief Operating Officer, and Edward Garden, who resigned as a director of the Company on December 14, 2015, beneficially own shares of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock that collectively constitute more than 20% of its total voting power as of February 29, 2016.  Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden may, from time to time, acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of Common Stock.On December 1, 2011, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Trian Agreement”) with Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden, and several of their affiliates (the “Covered Persons”).  Pursuant to the Trian Agreement, the Board of Directors, including a majority of the independent directors, approved, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“Section 203”), the Covered Persons becoming the owners (as defined in Section 203(c)(9) of the DGCL) of or acquiring an aggregate of up to (and including), but not more than, 32.5% (subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Agreement) of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock, such that no such persons would be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 203 solely as a result of such ownership (such approval, the “Section 203 Approval”).The Trian Agreement (other than the provisions relating to the Section 203 Approval and certain miscellaneous provisions that survive the termination of the agreement) terminated pursuant to the termination provisions of the Trian Agreement after funds affiliated with the Covered Persons sold 16.2 million shares of the Company’s Common Stock on January 15, 2014, thereby decreasing the Covered Persons’ beneficial ownership to less than 25% of the outstanding voting power of the Company as of that date.  The Covered Persons sold an additional 2.0 million shares of the Company’s Common Stock on February 25, 2014.  On July 17, 2015, the Company repurchased 18.4 million shares of the Company’s Common Stock from the Covered Persons.  The terminated provisions of the Trian Agreement included provisions restricting the Covered Persons in the following areas: (i) beneficial ownership of Company voting securities; (ii) solicitation of proxies or submission of a proposal for the vote of stockholders under certain circumstances; (iii) certain affiliate transactions with the Company; and (iv) voting of certain Company voting securities.This concentration of ownership gives Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden significant influence over the outcome of actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets.  They are also in a position to have significant influence to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.  If in the future Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden were to acquire more than a majority of the Company’s outstanding voting power, they would be able to determine the outcome of the election of members of the Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring majority stockholder approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets.  They would also be in a position to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.The Company’s certificate of incorporation contains certain anti-takeover provisions and permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and limits its ability to raise capital from affiliates.Certain provisions in the Company’s certificate of incorporation are intended to discourage or delay a hostile takeover of control of the Company.  The Company’s certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of “blank check” preferred stock, which will have such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.  Accordingly, the Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of its common stock.  The preferred stock could be used to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that is determined by the Board of Directors to be undesirable.  Although the Company has no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock, it cannot assure that it will not do so in the future.The Company’s certificate of incorporation prohibits the issuance of preferred stock to affiliates, unless offered ratably to the holders of the Company’s Common Stock, subject to an exception in the event that the Company is in financial distress and the issuance is approved by its audit committee.  This prohibition limits the ability to raise capital from affiliates"
9,WEN,WENDY'S CO,2015-02-26,"Risk Factors
.We wish to caution readers that in addition to the important factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we have included below the most significant factors that have affected, or in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results during fiscal 2015, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.Our success depends in part upon the continued retention of certain key personnel.There have been a number of changes in our senior management team beginning in 2011, including the appointment of a new President and Chief Executive Officer in September 2011.  We believe that over time our success has been dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management team.  The failure by us to retain members of our senior management team in the future could adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts we have undertaken to increase the efficiency and profitability of our business.Competition from other restaurant companies, or poor customer experience at Wendy’s restaurants, could hurt our brand.The market segments in which company-owned and franchised Wendy’s restaurants compete are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, price, food quality and presentation, service, location, convenience, and the nature and condition of the restaurant facility.  If customers have a poor experience at a Wendy’s restaurant, whether at a company-owned or franchised restaurant, we may experience a decrease in guest traffic.  Further, Wendy’s restaurants compete with a variety of locally-owned restaurants, as well as competitive regional and national chains and franchises.  Several of these chains compete by offering menu items that are targeted at certain consumer groups or dietary trends.  Additionally, many of our competitors have introduced lower cost, value meal menu options.  Our revenues and those of our franchisees may be hurt by this product and price competition.Moreover, new companies, including operators outside the quick-service restaurant industry, may enter our market areas and target our customer base.  For example, additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases have come from deli sections and in-store cafes of a number of major grocery store chains, as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets.  Such competitors may have, among other things, lower operating costs, better locations, better facilities, better management, better products, more effective marketing and more efficient operations.  Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing and marketing strategies in the quick-service restaurant industry better than we can.  Many of our competitors spend significantly more on advertising and marketing than we do, which may give them a competitive advantage through higher levels of brand awareness among consumers.  All such competition may adversely affect our revenues and profits by reducing revenues of company-owned restaurants and royalty revenue from franchised restaurants.Changes in consumer tastes and preferences, and in discretionary consumer spending, could result in a decline in sales at company-owned restaurants and in the royalties that we receive from franchisees.The quick-service restaurant industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions, discretionary spending priorities, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants.  Our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income.  Accordingly, we may experience declines in sales during economic downturns.  Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending or a decline in consumer food-away-from-home spending could hurt our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.If company-owned and franchised restaurants are unable to adapt to changes in consumer preferences and trends, company-owned and franchised restaurants may lose customers and the resulting revenues from company-owned restaurants and the royalties that we receive from franchisees may decline.Disruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.Disruptions in the national and global economies could result in higher unemployment rates and declines in consumer confidence and spending.  If such disruptions occur, they may result in significant declines in consumer food-away-from-home spending and customer traffic in our restaurants and those of our franchisees.  There can be no assurance that government responses  12to the disruptions will restore consumer confidence.  Ongoing disruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.Changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken and corn), supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs could harm results of operations.Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken and corn), supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs.  The Company experienced significant increases in certain commodity costs in 2014, and the Company expects ongoing commodity cost pressures in 2015.  Ongoing commodity cost pressures, and any increase in these costs, especially beef or chicken prices, could adversely affect future operating results.  In addition, our business is susceptible to increases in these costs as a result of other factors beyond its control, such as weather conditions, global demand, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulations.  Additionally, prices for feed ingredients used to produce beef and chicken could be adversely affected by changes in global weather patterns, which are inherently unpredictable, and by federal ethanol policy.  Increases in gasoline prices could result in the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors, which would increase our costs.  Significant increases in gasoline prices could also result in a decrease in customer traffic at our restaurants, which could adversely affect our business.  We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results.  In addition, we may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to our customers.Shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of perishable food products could damage the Wendy’s brand reputation and adversely affect our sales and operating results.Wendy’s and its franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet brand specifications.  Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, disease or food-borne illnesses, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which could lower our revenues, increase operating costs, damage brand reputation and otherwise harm our business and the businesses of our franchisees.Food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. Coli) involving Wendy’s or its supply chain, could create negative publicity and adversely affect sales and operating results.Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe, quality food products.  However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. Coli), have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future.Food safety events could adversely affect the price and availability of beef, poultry or other meats.  As a result, Wendy’s restaurants could experience a significant increase in food costs if there are food safety events whether or not such events involve Wendy’s restaurants or restaurants of competitors.In addition, food safety events, whether or not involving Wendy’s, could result in negative publicity for Wendy’s or for the industry or market segments in which we operate.  Increased use of social media could create and/or amplify the effects of negative publicity.  This negative publicity, as well as any other negative publicity concerning types of food products Wendy’s serves, may reduce demand for Wendy’s food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types.  A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could result in a decline in sales and operating results at company-owned restaurants or in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.Consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of beef, poultry, french fries or other products we sell, concerns regarding the ingredients in our products and/or cooking processes used in our restaurants, or concerns regarding the effects of disease outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics could affect demand for our products.Consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of beef, poultry, french fries or other products we sell, concerns regarding the ingredients in our products and/or cooking processes used in our restaurants, or concerns regarding the effects of disease outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics could result in less demand for our products and a decline in sales at company-owned restaurants and in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants. 13Increased use of social media could create and/or amplify the effects of negative publicity and adversely affect sales and operating results.Events reported in the media, including social media, whether or not accurate or involving Wendy’s, could create and/or amplify negative publicity for Wendy’s or for the industry or market segments in which we operate.  This could reduce demand for Wendy’s food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types.  A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of negative publicity from social media could result in a decline in sales and operating results at company-owned restaurants or in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.Growth of our restaurant business is dependent on new restaurant openings, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.Our restaurant business derives earnings from sales at company-owned restaurants, franchise royalties received from franchised restaurants and franchise fees from franchise restaurant operators for each new unit opened.  Growth in our restaurant revenues and earnings is dependent on new restaurant openings.  Numerous factors beyond our control may affect restaurant openings.  These factors include but are not limited to:•our ability to attract new franchisees;•the availability of site locations for new restaurants;•the ability of potential restaurant owners to obtain financing;•the ability of restaurant owners to hire, train and retain qualified operating personnel;•construction and development costs of new restaurants, particularly in highly-competitive markets;•the ability of restaurant owners to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all; and•adverse weather conditions.Wendy’s franchisees could take actions that could harm our business.Wendy’s franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with the standards set forth in agreements with them.  Wendy’s also provides training and support to franchisees.  However, franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and the franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants.  As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee.  If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with required standards, royalty payments to us will be adversely affected and the brand’s image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.Our success depends on franchisees’ participation in brand strategies.Wendy’s franchisees are an integral part of our business.  Wendy’s may be unable to successfully implement the strategies that it believes are necessary for further growth if franchisees do not participate in that implementation.  Our business and operating results could be adversely affected if a significant number of franchisees do not participate in brand strategies.The Company’s Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at company-owned and participating franchised restaurants or improve our results of operations.Throughout 2015, the Company expects Wendy’s and its franchisees to reimage approximately 450 existing company-owned and franchised restaurants and open approximately 80 new company-owned and franchised restaurants under its Image Activation program, with plans for significantly more new and reimaged Company and franchisee restaurants in 2016 and beyond.Wendy’s has incentive programs for franchisees that commence Image Activation restaurant remodels during 2015, 2016 and 2017.  The incentive programs provide reductions in royalty payments for one year or two years after the completion of construction depending upon the type of remodel.  Wendy’s also had incentive programs that included reductions in royalty payments in 2014 as well as cash incentives for franchisees’ participation in Wendy’s Image Activation program throughout 2014 and 2013.  These incentives will result in a reduction of royalties or other revenues received from franchisees during the periods covered. 14In addition to the Image Activation incentive programs described above, Wendy’s executed an agreement to partner with a third-party lender to establish a financing program for franchisees that participate in our Image Activation program.  Under the program, the lender is providing loans to franchisees to be used for the reimaging of restaurants according to the guidelines and specifications under the Image Activation program.  To support the program, Wendy’s has provided to the lender a $6.0 million irrevocable stand-by letter of credit.The Company’s Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at company-owned restaurants or improve results of operations.  There can be no assurance that sales at participating franchised restaurants will achieve or maintain projected levels or that after giving effect to the incentives provided to franchisees the Company’s results of operations will improve.Further, it is possible that Wendy’s may provide other financial incentives to franchisees to participate in the Image Activation program.  These incentives could also result in additional expense and/or a reduction of royalties or other revenues received from franchisees in the future.  If Wendy’s provides additional incentives to franchisees related to financing of the Image Activation program, Wendy’s may incur costs related to loan guarantees, interest rate subsidies and/or costs related to collectability of loans.In addition, most of the Wendy’s system consists of franchised restaurants.  Many of our franchisees will need to borrow funds in order to participate in the Image Activation program.  Other than the incentive programs described above, Wendy’s generally does not provide franchisees with financing but it continues to develop third-party financing sources for franchisees.  If our franchisees are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or not at all, they may be unwilling or unable to invest in the reimaging of their existing restaurants and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our financial results are affected by the operating results of franchisees.As of December 28, 2014, approximately 85% of the Wendy’s system were franchise restaurants.  We receive revenue in the form of royalties, which are generally based on a percentage of sales at franchised restaurants, rent and fees from franchisees.  Accordingly, a substantial portion of our financial results is to a large extent dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees.  If sales trends or economic conditions worsen for franchisees, their financial results may worsen and our royalty, rent and other fee revenues may decline.  In addition, accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts may increase.  When company-owned restaurants are sold, one of our subsidiaries is often required to remain responsible for lease payments for these restaurants to the extent that the purchasing franchisees default on their leases.  During periods of declining sales and profitability of franchisees, the incidence of franchisee defaults for these lease payments increases and we are then required to make those payments and seek recourse against the franchisee or agree to repayment terms.  Additionally, if franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements, or if we decide to restructure franchise agreements in order to induce franchisees to renew these agreements, then our royalty revenues may decrease.  Further, we may decide from time to time to acquire restaurants from franchisees that experience significant financial hardship, which may reduce our cash and cash equivalents.The system optimization initiative involves risks that could adversely affect our business and financial results.In August 2014, the Company announced a plan to sell all of its company-owned restaurants in Canada to franchisees as part of its ongoing system optimization initiative, which it now anticipates completing by the end of the second quarter of 2015.  In February 2015, the Company announced plans to sell approximately 500 additional restaurants to franchisees and reduce its ongoing Company-owned restaurant ownership to approximately 5% of the total system by the middle of 2016, as part of its ongoing system optimization initiative.  There are a number of risks associated with the system optimization initiative, including the difficulty in predicting the ultimate costs associated with the sale of restaurants, employee termination costs, the timing of payments made and received, the results of negotiations with landlords, the impact of the sale of restaurants on ongoing operations, any tax impact from the sale of restaurants, and the future impact to the Company’s earnings, restaurant operating margin, cash flow and depreciation.  If Wendy’s is unable to manage these risks effectively, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.Further, Wendy’s generally retains ownership or the leasehold interest to the real estate when it sells restaurants under the system optimization initiative and leases or subleases the real estate to franchisees.  This increases the risks described above under the heading “Our financial results are affected by the operating results of franchisees.” 15Wendy’s may be unable to manage effectively the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.Wendy’s has from time to time acquired the interests of and sold Wendy’s restaurants to franchisees.  Wendy’s intends to evaluate strategic acquisitions of franchised restaurants and strategic dispositions of company-owned restaurants to existing and new franchisees.  The success of these transactions is dependent upon the availability of sellers and buyers, the availability of financing, and the brand’s ability to negotiate transactions on terms deemed acceptable.  In addition, the operations of restaurants that the brand acquires may not be integrated successfully, and the intended benefits of such transactions may not be realized.  Acquisitions of franchised restaurants pose various risks to brand operations, including:•diversion of management’s attention to the integration of acquired restaurant operations;•increased operating expenses and the inability to achieve expected cost savings and operating efficiencies;•exposure to liabilities arising out of sellers’ prior operations of acquired restaurants; and•incurrence or assumption of debt to finance acquisitions or improvements and/or the assumption of long-term, non-cancelable leases.In addition, engaging in acquisitions and dispositions places increased demands on the brand’s operational and financial management resources and may require us to continue to expand these resources.  If Wendy’s is unable to manage the acquisition and disposition of restaurants effectively, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.Current restaurant locations may become unattractive, and attractive new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all.The success of any restaurant depends in substantial part on its location.  There can be no assurance that our current restaurant locations will continue to be attractive as demographic patterns change.  Neighborhood or economic conditions where our restaurants are located could decline in the future, thus resulting in potentially reduced sales in those locations.  In addition, rising real estate prices in some areas may restrict our ability and the ability of franchisees to purchase or lease new desirable locations.  If desirable locations cannot be obtained at reasonable prices, the brand’s ability to execute its growth strategies could be adversely affected.Wendy’s leasing and ownership of significant amounts of real estate exposes it to possible liabilities and losses, including liabilities associated with environmental matters.As of December 28, 2014, Wendy’s leased or owned the land and/or the building for 957 Wendy’s restaurants.  Wendy’s also owned 230 and leased 488 properties that were either leased or subleased principally to franchisees as of December 28, 2014.  Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate.  In particular, the value of our real property assets could decrease, and costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends, supply or demand for the use of the restaurants, which may result from competition from similar restaurants in the area, and liability for environmental matters.Wendy’s is subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances.  These environmental laws provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner, operator or occupant of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances.  Third parties may also make claims against owners, operators or occupants of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such substances.  A number of our restaurant sites were formerly gas stations or are adjacent to current or former gas stations, or were used for other commercial activities that can create environmental impacts.  We may also acquire or lease these types of sites in the future.  We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of all of our properties.  We may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our leased and owned properties, and any such liabilities identified in the future could cause us to incur significant costs, including costs associated with litigation, fines or clean-up responsibilities.  In addition, we cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted.  We cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with any environmental laws or regulations or to satisfy any such claims.  See “Item 1. Business - General - Legal and Environmental Matters.”Wendy’s leases real property generally for initial terms of 15 to 20 years with one or more options to extend the term of the leases in consecutive five-year increments.  Many leases provide that the landlord may increase the rent over the term of the lease and any renewals thereof.  Most leases require us to pay all of the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities.  We generally  16cannot cancel these leases.  If an existing or future restaurant is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term.  In addition, as each lease expires, we may fail to negotiate additional renewals or renewal options, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close restaurants in desirable locations.Due to the concentration of Wendy’s restaurants in particular geographic regions, our business results could be impacted by the adverse economic conditions prevailing in those regions regardless of the state of the national economy as a whole.As of December 28, 2014, we and our franchisees operated Wendy’s restaurants in 50 states, the District of Columbia and 28 foreign countries and territories.  As of December 28, 2014 and as detailed in “Item 2. Properties,” the 8 leading states by number of operating units were: Florida, Ohio, Texas, Georgia, California, Michigan, Pennsylvania and North Carolina.  This geographic concentration can cause economic conditions in particular areas of the country to have a disproportionate impact on our overall results of operations.  It is possible that adverse economic conditions in states or regions that contain a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the future.Our operations are influenced by adverse weather conditions.Weather, which is unpredictable, can impact Wendy’s restaurant sales.  Harsh weather conditions that keep customers from dining out result in lost opportunities for our restaurants.  A heavy snowstorm in the Northeast or Midwest or a hurricane in the Southeast can shut down an entire metropolitan area, resulting in a reduction in sales in that area.  Our first quarter includes winter months and historically has a lower level of sales at company-owned restaurants.  Because a significant portion of our restaurant operating costs is fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of sales during these periods hurts our operating margins, and can result in restaurant operating losses.  For these reasons, a quarter-to-quarter comparison may not be a good indication of Wendy’s performance or how it may perform in the future.Wendy’s business could be hurt by increased labor costs or labor shortages.Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our company-owned restaurants.  Wendy’s devotes significant resources to recruiting and training its managers and hourly employees.  Increased labor costs due to competition, increased minimum wage or employee benefits costs (including various federal, state and local actions to increase minimum wages and government-mandated health care benefits), unionization activity or other factors would adversely impact our cost of sales and operating expenses.  In addition, Wendy’s success depends on its ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and staff.  If the brand is unable to do so, our results of operations could be adversely affected.The Company, through a subsidiary, has withdrawn from a multiemployer pension plan.  Wendy’s assumed an estimated withdrawal liability in the fourth quarter of 2013, but the final withdrawal liability will be determined through discussions with the pension fund administrator.Prior to the fourth quarter of 2013, the unionized employees at The New Bakery Co. of Ohio, Inc. (the “Bakery Company”), a 100% owned subsidiary of Wendy’s, now known as The New Bakery Company, LLC, were covered by the Bakery and Confectionery Union and Industry International Pension Fund (the “Union Pension Fund”), a multiemployer pension plan.  The Bakery Company remitted contributions based on hours worked by covered, unionized employees pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement that expired on March 31, 2013 and the Rehabilitation Plan adopted by the Union Pension Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 due to the underfunded status of the plan.In December of 2013, the Bakery Company terminated its participation in the Union Pension Fund and formally notified the plan’s trustees of its withdrawal from the plan.  The  Union Pension Fund administrator has acknowledged the withdrawal, which required Wendy’s to assume an estimated withdrawal liability of $13.5 million based on the applicable requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as amended, and which was included in “Cost of sales” during the fourth quarter of 2013.  As a result, Wendy’s made payments to the Union Pension Fund totaling $0.7 million during 2014 which were recorded as a reduction to the withdrawal liability.  The Bakers Local No. 57, Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers & Grain Millers International Union of America, AFL-CIO (the “Union”) filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board (the “NLRB”) related to the Bakery Company’s withdrawal from the Union Pension Fund.  On July 22, 2014, The New Bakery of Zanesville, LLC (“Zanesville”), a 100% owned subsidiary of Wendy’s, and the Union entered into a settlement agreement with the NLRB.  The terms of the settlement include an agreement by Zanesville and the Union to recommence negotiations.  Zanesville and the Union have recommenced negotiations.  Any final withdrawal liability will be determined through discussions between Zanesville and the Union Pension Fund administrator at the conclusion of the negotiations with the Union. 17The unionized employees became eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan as of December 5, 2013.Complaints or litigation may hurt the Wendy’s brand.Wendy’s customers file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to a Wendy’s restaurant, or alleging that there was a problem with food quality or operations at a Wendy’s restaurant.  We are also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims from franchisees (which tend to increase when franchisees experience declining sales and profitability) and claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, including class action lawsuits related to these matters.  Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management’s attention away from operations and hurt our performance.  We cannot estimate the aggregate possible range of loss due to most proceedings being in preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur, and significant factual matters unresolved.  In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties.  Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions are thus inherently difficult.  A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.  Further, adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt us and our franchisees.Additionally, the restaurant industry has been subject to a number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have contributed to the obesity of certain of their customers.  Adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may harm the reputation of our restaurants, even if the allegations are not directed against our restaurants or are not valid, and even if we are not found liable or the concerns relate only to a single restaurant or a limited number of restaurants.  Moreover, complaints, litigation or adverse publicity experienced by one or more of Wendy’s franchisees could also hurt our business as a whole.We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of the Wendy’s brand and hurt our business.Our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business.  We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and other intellectual property.  The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both existing and new markets.  If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property, either in print or on the Internet, the value of our brand may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the failure of our brand to achieve and maintain market acceptance.  This could harm our image, brand or competitive position and, if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, cause us to incur significant legal fees.We franchise our brand to various franchisees.  While we try to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by all of our franchisees, we cannot assure that these franchisees will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property or the reputation of the Wendy’s restaurant system.We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions.  The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the United States in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries.  We cannot assure that all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate.  The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.In addition, we cannot assure that third parties will not claim infringement by us in the future.  Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause delays in introducing new menu items, require costly modifications to advertising and promotional materials or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.  As a result, any such claim could harm our business and cause a decline in our results of operations and financial condition.Our current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims that may be filed.We currently maintain insurance we believe is adequate for businesses of our size and type.  However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters or acts of terrorism. In addition, we currently self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under workers compensation, general liability and property insurance programs.  Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and  18management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs, which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Changes in legal or regulatory requirements, including franchising laws, payment card industry rules, overtime rules, minimum wage rates, government-mandated health care benefits, tax legislation, federal ethanol policy and accounting standards, may adversely affect our ability to open new restaurants or otherwise hurt our existing and future operations and results.Each Wendy’s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, safety and other agencies in the state and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located, as well as to Federal laws, rules and regulations and requirements of non-governmental entities such as payment card industry rules.  State and local government authorities may enact laws, rules or regulations that impact restaurant operations and the cost of conducting those operations.  There can be no assurance that we and/or our franchisees will not experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants, which could delay the opening of such restaurants in the future.  In addition, more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to tax, zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.Federal laws, rules and regulations address many aspects of our business, such as franchising, federal ethanol policy, minimum wages and taxes.  We and our franchisees are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, along with the ADA, family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted by the states that govern these and other employment law matters.  Changes in laws, rules, regulations and governmental policies, including the joint employer standard, could increase our costs and adversely affect our existing and future operations and results.Changes in government-mandated health care benefits under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) are also anticipated to increase our costs and the costs of our franchisees.  Our compliance with the PPACA may result in significant modifications to our employment and benefits policies and practices.  Wendy’s experienced a modest enrollment in its health plans with newly eligible employees.  Because participation in the health plans by newly full-time employees was modest, the cost increases did not result in modifications to our business practices.  However, future cost increases may be material and any future modifications to our business practices may be disruptive to our operations and impact our ability to attract and retain personnel.Changes in accounting standards, or in the interpretation of existing standards, applicable to us could also affect our future results.Wendy’s does not exercise ultimate control over purchasing for its restaurant system, which could harm sales or profitability and the brand.Although Wendy’s ensures that all suppliers to the Wendy’s system meet quality control standards, Wendy’s franchisees control the purchasing of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies from such suppliers through the purchasing co-op controlled by Wendy’s franchisees, QSCC.  QSCC negotiates national contracts for such food, equipment and supplies.  Wendy’s is entitled to appoint two representatives (of the total of 11) on the board of directors of QSCC and participates in QSCC through its company-owned restaurants, but does not control the decisions and activities of QSCC except to ensure that all suppliers satisfy Wendy’s quality control standards.  If QSCC does not properly estimate the product needs of the Wendy’s system, makes poor purchasing decisions, or decides to cease its operations, system sales and operating costs could be adversely affected and our results of operations and financial condition or the financial condition of Wendy’s franchisees could be hurt.Our international operations are subject to various factors of uncertainty and there is no assurance that international operations will be profitable.In addition to many of the risk factors described throughout this Item 1A, Wendy’s business outside of the United States is subject to a number of additional factors, including international economic and political conditions, risk of corruption and violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws of other countries, differing cultures and consumer preferences, the inability to adapt to international customer preferences, inadequate brand infrastructure within foreign countries to support our international activities, inability to obtain adequate supplies meeting our quality standards and product specifications or interruptions in obtaining such supplies, restrictions on our ability to move cash out of certain foreign countries, currency regulations and fluctuations, diverse government regulations and tax systems, uncertain or differing interpretations of rights and obligations in connection with international franchise agreements and the collection of royalties from international franchisees, the availability and cost of land, construction costs, other legal, financial or regulatory impediments to the development and/or operation of new restaurants, and the availability of experienced management, appropriate franchisees, and joint venture partners.  Although we  19believe we have developed the support structure required for international growth, there is no assurance that such growth will occur or that international operations will be profitable.To the extent we invest in international company-operated restaurants or joint ventures, we would also have the risk of operating losses related to those restaurants, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We rely on computer systems and information technology to run our business.  Any material failure, interruption or security breach of our computer systems or information technology may result in adverse publicity and adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations.We are significantly dependent upon our computer systems and information technology to properly conduct our business.  A failure or interruption of computer systems or information technology could result in the loss of data, business interruptions or delays in business operations.  Also, despite our considerable efforts and technological resources to secure our computer systems and information technology, security breaches, such as unauthorized access and computer viruses, may occur resulting in system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  A significant security breach of our computer systems or information technology could require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, and incur penalties or other costs that could adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations.Failure to comply with laws, regulations and third-party contracts regarding the collection, maintenance and processing of information may result in adverse publicity and adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations.We collect, maintain and process certain information about customers and employees.  Our use and protection of this information is regulated by various laws and regulations, as well as by third-party contracts.  If our systems or employees fail to comply with these laws, regulations or contract terms, it could require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, increase fees payable to third parties, and incur penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations.We may be required to recognize additional asset impairment and other asset-related charges.We have significant amounts of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets and have incurred impairment charges in the past with respect to those assets.  In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we test for impairment generally annually, or more frequently, if there are indicators of impairment, such as:•significant adverse changes in the business climate;•current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with long-lived assets;•a current expectation that more-likely-than-not (i.e., a likelihood that is more than 50%) long-lived assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life; and•a significant drop in our stock price.Based upon future economic and capital market conditions, as well as the operating performance of our reporting units, future impairment charges could be incurred.  Further, as a result of the system optimization initiative, the Company has recorded losses on remeasuring long-lived assets to fair value upon determination that the assets will be leased and/or subleased to franchisees in connection with the sale or anticipated sale of restaurants, and may incur further losses as the Company continues to sell restaurants under the system optimization initiative.We enter into swaps and other derivative contracts, which expose us to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties.We have entered into interest rate swaps and other derivative contracts as described in Note 11 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in Item 8 herein, and we may enter into additional swaps in the future.  We are exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on these instruments, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 20Wendy’s and its subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions, and substantially all of their non-real estate assets are pledged and subject to certain restrictions, under a credit agreement.On May 16, 2013, Wendy’s amended and restated its credit agreement, dated May 15, 2012 (the “Restated Credit Agreement”).  The Restated Credit Agreement is comprised of a $350.0 million senior secured term loan facility (“Term A Loans”), a partial refinancing of our existing term loan resulting in a $769.4 million senior secured term loan facility (“Term B Loans”) and a $200.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility.  The Restated Credit Agreement also contains provisions for an uncommitted increase of up to $275.0 million principal amount of the Term B Loans subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.  The revolving credit facility includes a sub-facility for the issuance of up to $70.0 million of letters of credit and allows for liens in the form of cash collateralized letters of credit up to an additional $40.0 million.  During 2013, Wendy’s transitioned the security for all of its outstanding letters of credit from the revolving credit facility to cash collateral.  Therefore, as of December 28, 2014 and December 29, 2013, there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility.On September 24, 2013, Wendy’s entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to its Restated Credit Agreement to borrow an aggregate principal amount up to $225.0 million of additional Term A Loans (“Incremental Term Loans”).  On October 24, 2013, Wendy’s borrowed $225.0 million of Incremental Term Loans under the Amendment.The obligations under the Restated Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the non-real estate assets and stock of Wendy’s and its domestic subsidiaries (other than certain unrestricted subsidiaries) and 65% of the stock of certain of its foreign subsidiaries, in each case subject to certain limitations and exceptions.  The affirmative and negative covenants in the Restated Credit Agreement include, among others, preservation of corporate existence; payment of taxes; maintenance of insurance; and limitations on: indebtedness (including guarantee obligations of other indebtedness); liens; mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions; sales of assets; dividends and other payments in respect of capital stock; investments; payments of certain indebtedness; transactions with affiliates; changes in fiscal year; negative pledge clauses and clauses restricting subsidiary distributions; and material changes in lines of business.  The financial covenants contained in the Restated Credit Agreement are (i) a consolidated interest coverage ratio, and (ii) a consolidated senior secured leverage ratio.  For purposes of these covenants, “consolidated” means the combined results of Wendy’s and its subsidiaries (other than unrestricted subsidiaries).  The covenants generally do not restrict The Wendy’s Company or any of its subsidiaries that are not subsidiaries of Wendy’s.  If Wendy’s and its subsidiaries are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain the funds necessary to make required payments of interest or principal under, or are unable to comply with covenants of, the Restated Credit Agreement, then Wendy’s would be in default under the terms of the agreement, which would preclude the payment of dividends to The Wendy’s Company, restrict access to the revolving credit facility, and, under certain circumstances, permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness.  See Note 10 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in Item 8 herein, for further information regarding the Restated Credit Agreement.Wendy’s has a significant amount of debt outstanding. Such indebtedness, along with the other contractual commitments of our subsidiaries, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to meet debt payment obligations.Wendy’s has a significant amount of debt and debt service requirements.  As of December 28, 2014, on a consolidated basis, there was approximately $1.4 billion of outstanding debt.This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:•making it more difficult to meet payment and other obligations under outstanding debt;•resulting in an event of default if our subsidiaries fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of our subsidiaries’ debt becoming immediately due and payable;•reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;•subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates, including borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged. 21In addition, certain of our subsidiaries also have significant contractual requirements for the purchase of soft drinks.  Wendy’s has also provided loan guarantees to various lenders on behalf of franchisees entering into debt arrangements for new restaurant development and equipment financing, and two guarantees to lenders for franchisees, in connection with the refinancing of a franchisee’s debt and the sale of restaurants to a franchisee.  Certain subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have been indemnified.  In addition, certain subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have not been indemnified.  Wendy’s has also provided an irrevocable stand-by letter of credit to a lender to support a financing program for franchisees that participate in our Image Activation program.  These commitments could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and the ability of our subsidiaries to meet payment obligations.The ability to meet payment and other obligations under the debt instruments of our subsidiaries depends on their ability to generate significant cash flow in the future.  This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control.  We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under existing or any future credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable our subsidiaries to meet their debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs.  If our subsidiaries are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations, they may need to refinance or restructure debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital.  If our subsidiaries are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, they may not be able to meet debt payment and other obligations.We have announced that we intend to incur substantially more debt.  This would exacerbate further the risks associated with our substantial leverage.We have announced that we intend to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, in the future.  If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current consolidated debt levels, the related risks that we now face would intensify.To service debt and meet its other cash needs, Wendy’s will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be generated or available to it.The ability of Wendy’s to make payments on, or repay or refinance, its debt, including the Restated Credit Agreement and any additional debt, and to fund planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend largely upon its future operating performance.  Future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.  In addition, the ability of Wendy’s to borrow funds in the future to make payments on its debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in its credit facilities and other debt agreements, including the Restated Credit Agreement and other agreements it may enter into in the future.  Specifically, Wendy’s will need to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests.  There is no assurance that the Wendy’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under its credit facilities or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its debt or to fund its or The Wendy’s Company’s dividend and other liquidity needs.There can be no assurance regarding whether or to what extent the Company will pay dividends on its Common Stock in the future.Holders of the Company’s Common Stock will only be entitled to receive such dividends as its Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments.  Any dividends will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the Company’s earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time.Because the Company is a holding company, its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent upon cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand and cash flows from its subsidiaries.  The ability of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends and/or make loans or advances to the holding company will be dependent upon their respective abilities to achieve sufficient cash flows after satisfying their respective cash requirements, including subsidiary-level debt service and revolving credit agreements, to enable the payment of such dividends or the making of such loans or advances.  The ability of any of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or other payments to the Company will also be limited by restrictions in debt instruments currently existing or subsequently entered into by such subsidiaries, including the Restated Credit Agreement, which is described earlier in this Item 1A. 22A substantial amount of the Company’s Common Stock is concentrated in the hands of certain stockholders.Nelson Peltz, the Company’s Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, Peter May, the Company’s Vice Chairman and former President and Chief Operating Officer, and Edward Garden, a director of the Company, beneficially own shares of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock that collectively constitute more than 24% of its total voting power as of February 25, 2015.  Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden may, from time to time, acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of Common Stock.On December 1, 2011, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Trian Agreement”) with Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden, and several of their affiliates (the “Covered Persons”).  Pursuant to the Trian Agreement, the Board of Directors, including a majority of the independent directors, approved, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“Section 203”), the Covered Persons becoming the owners (as defined in Section 203(c)(9) of the DGCL) of or acquiring an aggregate of up to (and including), but not more than, 32.5% (subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Agreement) of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock, such that no such persons would be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 203 solely as a result of such ownership (such approval, the “Section 203 Approval”).The Trian Agreement (other than the provisions relating to the Section 203 Approval and certain miscellaneous provisions that survive the termination of the agreement) terminated pursuant to the termination provisions of the Trian Agreement after funds affiliated with the Covered Persons sold 16.2 million shares of the Company’s Common Stock on January 15, 2014, thereby decreasing the Covered Persons’ beneficial ownership to less than 25% of the outstanding voting power of the Company as of that date.  The Covered Persons sold an additional 2.0 million shares of the Company’s Common Stock on February 25, 2014.  The terminated provisions of the Trian Agreement included provisions restricting the Covered Persons in the following areas: (i) beneficial ownership of Company voting securities; (ii) solicitation of proxies or submission of a proposal for the vote of stockholders under certain circumstances; (iii) certain affiliate transactions with the Company; and (iv) voting of certain Company voting securities.This concentration of ownership gives Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden significant influence over the outcome of actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets.  They are also in a position to have significant influence to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.  If in the future Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden were to acquire more than a majority of the Company’s outstanding voting power, they would be able to determine the outcome of the election of members of the Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring majority stockholder approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets.  They would also be in a position to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.The Company’s certificate of incorporation contains certain anti-takeover provisions and permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and limits its ability to raise capital from affiliates.Certain provisions in the Company’s certificate of incorporation are intended to discourage or delay a hostile takeover of control of the Company.  The Company’s certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of “blank check” preferred stock, which will have such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.  Accordingly, the Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of its common stock.  The preferred stock could be used to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that is determined by the Board of Directors to be undesirable.  Although the Company has no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock, it cannot assure that it will not do so in the future.The Company’s certificate of incorporation prohibits the issuance of preferred stock to affiliates, unless offered ratably to the holders of the Company’s Common Stock, subject to an exception in the event that the Company is in financial distress and the issuance is approved by its audit committee.  This prohibition limits the ability to raise capital from affiliates"
14,WEN,WENDY'S CO,2014-02-27,"  Risk Factors
.We wish to caution readers that in addition to the important factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we have included below the most significant factors that have affected, or in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results during fiscal 2014, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.  Our success depends in part upon the continued retention of certain key personnel.  There were a number of changes in our senior management team in 2011 through 2013, including the appointment of a new President and Chief Executive Officer. We believe that over time our success has been dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management team.  The failure by us to retain members of our senior management team in the future could adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts we have undertaken to increase the efficiency and profitability of our business.  Competition from other restaurant companies, or poor customer experience at Wendy’s restaurants, could hurt our brand.The market segments in which company-owned and franchised Wendy’s restaurants compete are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, price, food quality and presentation, service, location, convenience, and the nature and condition of the restaurant facility. If customers have a poor experience at a Wendy’s restaurant, whether at a company-owned or franchised restaurant, we may experience a decrease in guest traffic. Further, Wendy’s restaurants compete with a variety of locally-owned  11restaurants, as well as competitive regional and national chains and franchises.  Several of these chains compete by offering menu items that are targeted at certain consumer groups or dietary trends.  Additionally, many of our competitors have introduced lower cost, value meal menu options.  Our revenues and those of our franchisees may be hurt by this product and price competition.Moreover, new companies, including operators outside the quick-service restaurant industry, may enter our market areas and target our customer base.  For example, additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases have come from deli sections and in-store cafes of a number of major grocery store chains, as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets.  Such competitors may have, among other things, lower operating costs, better locations, better facilities, better management, better products, more effective marketing and more efficient operations.  Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing and marketing strategies in the quick-service restaurant industry better than we can.  Many of our competitors spend significantly more on advertising and marketing than we do, which may give them a competitive advantage through higher levels of brand awareness among consumers.  All such competition may adversely affect our revenues and profits by reducing revenues of company-owned restaurants and royalty payments from franchised restaurants.  Changes in consumer tastes and preferences, and in discretionary consumer spending, could result in a decline in sales at company-owned restaurants and in the royalties that we receive from franchisees.The quick-service restaurant industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions, discretionary spending priorities, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants. Our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income.  Accordingly, we may experience declines in sales during economic downturns.  Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending or a decline in consumer food-away-from-home spending could hurt our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.If company-owned and franchised restaurants are unable to adapt to changes in consumer preferences and trends, company-owned and franchised restaurants may lose customers and the resulting revenues from company-owned restaurants and the royalties that we receive from franchisees may decline.The disruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.  The disruptions in the national and global economies have resulted in high unemployment rates and declines in consumer confidence and spending.  If such conditions persist, they may result in significant declines in consumer food-away-from-home spending and customer traffic in our restaurants and those of our franchisees.  There can be no assurance that government responses to the disruptions will restore consumer confidence.  Ongoing disruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.Changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken and corn), supply, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs could harm results of operations.Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken and corn), supply, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs.  Any increase in these costs, especially beef or chicken prices, could harm operating results.  In addition, our brand is susceptible to increases in these costs as a result of other factors beyond its control, such as weather conditions, global demand, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulations.  Additionally, prices for feed ingredients used to produce beef and chicken could be adversely affected by changes in global weather patterns, which are inherently unpredictable, and by federal ethanol policy.  Increases in gasoline prices would result in the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors, which would increase our costs.  Significant increases in gasoline prices could also result in a decrease in customer traffic at our restaurants, which could adversely affect our business.  We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results.  In addition, we may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to our customers. 12Shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of perishable food products could damage the Wendy’s brand reputation and adversely affect our operating results. Wendy’s and its franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet brand specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, disease or food-borne illnesses, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which could lower our revenues, increase operating costs, damage brand reputation and otherwise harm our business and the businesses of our franchisees.Food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. Coli) involving Wendy’s or its supply chain, could create negative publicity and adversely affect sales and operating results.Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe, quality food products. However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. Coli), have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future. Food safety events could adversely affect the price and availability of beef, poultry or other meats. As a result, Wendy’s restaurants could experience a significant increase in food costs if there are food safety events whether or not such events involve Wendy’s restaurants or restaurants of competitors.  In addition, food safety events, whether or not involving Wendy’s, could result in negative publicity for Wendy’s or for the industry or market segments in which we operate.  Increased use of social media could create and/or amplify the effects of negative publicity.  This negative publicity, as well as any other negative publicity concerning types of food products Wendy’s serves, may reduce demand for Wendy’s food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types.  A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could result in a decline in sales and operating results at company-owned restaurants or in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.Consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of beef, poultry, french fries or other products we sell, concerns regarding the ingredients in our products and/or cooking processes used in our restaurants, or concerns regarding the effects of disease outbreaks such as “mad cow disease” and avian influenza or “bird flu,” could affect demand for our products.Consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of beef, poultry, french fries or other products we sell, concerns regarding the ingredients in our products and/or cooking processes used in our restaurants, or concerns regarding the effects of disease outbreaks such as “mad cow disease” and avian influenza or “bird flu,” could result in less demand for our products and a decline in sales at company-owned restaurants and in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.Increased use of social media could create and/or amplify the effects of negative publicity and adversely affect sales and operating results.Events reported in the media, including social media, whether or not accurate or involving Wendy’s, could create and/or amplify negative publicity for Wendy’s or for the industry or market segments in which we operate.  This could reduce demand for Wendy’s food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types.  A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of negative publicity from social media could result in a decline in sales and operating results at company-owned restaurants or in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.Growth of our restaurant businesses is dependent on new restaurant openings, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.Our restaurant businesses derive earnings from sales at company-owned restaurants, franchise royalties received from franchised restaurants and franchise fees from franchise restaurant operators for each new unit opened.  Growth in our restaurant revenues and earnings is dependent on new restaurant openings.  Numerous factors beyond our control may affect restaurant openings.  These factors include but are not limited to:•our ability to attract new franchisees; •the availability of site locations for new restaurants; 13•the ability of potential restaurant owners to obtain financing; •the ability of restaurant owners to hire, train and retain qualified operating personnel;•construction and development costs of new restaurants, particularly in highly-competitive markets;•the ability of restaurant owners to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all; and•adverse weather conditions.Wendy’s franchisees could take actions that could harm our business.Wendy’s franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with the standards set forth in agreements with them.  Wendy’s also provides training and support to franchisees.  However, franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and the franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants.  As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee.  If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with required standards, royalty payments to us will be adversely affected and the brand’s image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.Our success depends on franchisees’ participation in brand strategies.Wendy’s franchisees are an integral part of our business.  Wendy’s may be unable to successfully implement the strategies that it believes are necessary for further growth if franchisees do not participate in that implementation.  Our business and operating results could be adversely affected if a significant number of franchisees do not participate in brand strategies.The Company’s Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at company-owned and participating franchised restaurants or improve our results of operations. Throughout 2014, Wendy’s plans to reimage approximately 200 existing company-owned restaurants and open approximately 15 new company-owned restaurants under its Image Activation program, with plans for significantly more new and reimaged Company and franchisee restaurants in 2015 and beyond. Wendy’s also expects that franchisees will reimage between 150 and 200 restaurants and build approximately 45 new Image Activation restaurants in 2014. Wendy’s has an incentive program for franchisees that commence Image Activation restaurant remodels or open newly constructed Image Activation design restaurants during 2014 and for franchisees that open newly constructed Image Activation design restaurants during 2015.  The incentive program provides reductions in royalty payments for up to the first three years after the completion of construction.  In addition, the program includes cash incentives for new and remodeled restaurants in the Image Activation design during 2014.  These incentives could result in additional expense and/or a reduction of royalties or other revenues received from franchisees in the future.  Wendy’s also had an incentive program for franchisees’ participation in Wendy’s Image Activation program during 2013. The Company’s Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at company-owned restaurants or improve results of operations.  There can be no assurance that sales at participating franchised restaurants will achieve or maintain projected levels or that after giving effect to the incentives provided to franchisees the Company’s results of operations will improve. Further, it is possible that Wendy’s may provide other financial incentives to franchisees to participate in the Image Activation program.  These incentives could also result in additional expense and/or a reduction of royalties or other revenues received from franchisees in the future. If Wendy’s provides incentives to franchisees related to financing of the Image Activation program, Wendy’s may incur costs related to loan guarantees, interest rate subsidies and/or costs related to collectability of loans.In addition, most of the Wendy’s system consists of franchised restaurants. Many of our franchisees will need to borrow funds in order to participate in the Image Activation program. Other than the incentive programs described above, Wendy’s generally does not provide franchisees with financing but it is actively developing third-party financing sources for franchisees. If our franchisees are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or not at all, they may be unwilling or unable to invest in the reimaging of their existing restaurants and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our financial results are affected by the operating results of franchisees.As of December 29, 2013, approximately 82% of the Wendy’s system were franchise restaurants.  We receive revenue in the form of royalties, which are generally based on a percentage of sales at franchised restaurants, rent and fees from franchisees.   14Accordingly, a substantial portion of our financial results is to a large extent dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees.  If sales trends or economic conditions worsen for franchisees, their financial results may worsen and our royalty, rent and other fee revenues may decline.  In addition, accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts may increase.  When company-owned restaurants are sold, one of our subsidiaries is often required to remain responsible for lease payments for these restaurants to the extent that the purchasing franchisees default on their leases.  During periods of declining sales and profitability of franchisees, the incidence of franchisee defaults for these lease payments increases and we are then required to make those payments and seek recourse against the franchisee or agree to repayment terms.  Additionally, if franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements, or if we decide to restructure franchise agreements in order to induce franchisees to renew these agreements, then our royalty revenues may decrease.  Further, we may decide from time to time to acquire restaurants from franchisees that experience significant financial hardship, which may reduce our cash and cash equivalents.The system optimization initiative involves risks that could adversely affect our business and financial results.In July 2013, the Company announced a system optimization initiative, as part of its brand transformation, which includes a plan to sell approximately 425 company-owned restaurants to franchisees by the end of the first quarter of 2014.  There are a number of risks associated with the system optimization initiative, including the difficulty in predicting the ultimate costs associated with the sale of restaurants, employee termination costs, the timing of payments made and received, the results of negotiations with landlords, the impact of the sale of restaurants on ongoing operations, any tax impact from the sale of restaurants, and the future benefits to the Company’s earnings, restaurant operating margin, cash flow and depreciation.  If Wendy’s is unable to manage these risks effectively, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.Wendy’s may be unable to manage effectively the acquisition and disposition of restaurants not part of the system optimization initiative, which could adversely affect our business and financial results. Wendy’s has from time to time acquired the interests of and sold Wendy’s restaurants to franchisees not part of the system optimization initiative.  Wendy’s intends to evaluate strategic acquisitions of franchised restaurants and strategic dispositions of company-owned restaurants to existing and new franchisees not part of the system optimization initiative.  The success of these transactions is dependent upon the availability of sellers and buyers, the availability of financing, and the brand’s ability to negotiate transactions on terms deemed acceptable.  In addition, the operations of restaurants that the brand acquires may not be integrated successfully, and the intended benefits of such transactions may not be realized.  Acquisitions of franchised restaurants pose various risks to brand operations, including: •diversion of management’s attention to the integration of acquired restaurant operations;•increased operating expenses and the inability to achieve expected cost savings and operating efficiencies;•exposure to liabilities arising out of sellers’ prior operations of acquired restaurants; and•incurrence or assumption of debt to finance acquisitions or improvements and/or the assumption of long-term, non-cancelable leases.In addition, engaging in acquisitions and dispositions places increased demands on the brand’s operational and financial management resources and may require us to continue to expand these resources.  If Wendy’s is unable to manage the acquisition and disposition of restaurants effectively, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.Current restaurant locations may become unattractive, and attractive new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all. The success of any restaurant depends in substantial part on its location.  There can be no assurance that our current restaurant locations will continue to be attractive as demographic patterns change.  Neighborhood or economic conditions where our restaurants are located could decline in the future, thus resulting in potentially reduced sales in those locations.  In addition, rising real estate prices in some areas may restrict our ability and the ability of franchisees to purchase or lease new desirable locations.  If desirable locations cannot be obtained at reasonable prices, the brand’s ability to execute its growth strategies will be adversely affected.Wendy’s leasing and ownership of significant amounts of real estate exposes it to possible liabilities and losses, including liabilities associated with environmental matters. As of December 29, 2013, Wendy’s leased or owned the land and/or the building for 1,183 Wendy’s restaurants.  Wendy’s also owned 138 and leased 276 properties that were either leased or subleased principally to franchisees as of December 29, 2013.  Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate.  In particular, the value of our real  15property assets could decrease, and costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends, supply or demand for the use of the restaurants, which may result from competition from similar restaurants in the area, and liability for environmental matters.Wendy’s is subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances.  These environmental laws provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner, operator or occupant of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances.  Third parties may also make claims against owners, operators or occupants of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such substances.  A number of our restaurant sites were formerly gas stations or are adjacent to current or former gas stations, or were used for other commercial activities that can create environmental impacts.  We may also acquire or lease these types of sites in the future.  We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of all of our properties.  We may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our leased and owned properties, and any such liabilities identified in the future could cause us to incur significant costs, including costs associated with litigation, fines or clean-up responsibilities.  In addition, we cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted.  We cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with any environmental laws or regulations or to satisfy any such claims.  See “Item 1. Business - General - Legal and Environmental Matters.” Wendy’s leases real property generally for initial terms of 20 years with two to four additional options to extend the term of the leases in consecutive five-year increments.  Many leases provide that the landlord may increase the rent over the term of the lease and any renewals thereof.  Most leases require us to pay all of the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities.  We generally cannot cancel these leases.  If an existing or future restaurant is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term.  In addition, as each lease expires, we may fail to negotiate additional renewals or renewal options, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close restaurants in desirable locations.Due to the concentration of Wendy’s restaurants in particular geographic regions, our business results could be impacted by the adverse economic conditions prevailing in those regions regardless of the state of the national economy as a whole.As of December 29, 2013, we and our franchisees operated Wendy’s restaurants in 50 states, the District of Columbia and 28 foreign countries and territories.  As of December 29, 2013 and as detailed in “Item 2. Properties,” the 8 leading states by number of operating units were: Florida, Ohio, Texas, Georgia, Michigan, California, Pennsylvania and North Carolina.  This geographic concentration can cause economic conditions in particular areas of the country to have a disproportionate impact on our overall results of operations.  It is possible that adverse economic conditions in states or regions that contain a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the future.Our operations are influenced by adverse weather conditions.Weather, which is unpredictable, can impact Wendy’s restaurant sales.  Harsh weather conditions that keep customers from dining out result in lost opportunities for our restaurants.  A heavy snowstorm in the Northeast or Midwest or a hurricane in the Southeast can shut down an entire metropolitan area, resulting in a reduction in sales in that area.  Our first quarter includes winter months and historically has a lower level of sales at company-owned restaurants.  Because a significant portion of our restaurant operating costs is fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of sales during these periods hurts our operating margins, and can result in restaurant operating losses.  For these reasons, a quarter-to-quarter comparison may not be a good indication of Wendy’s performance or how it may perform in the future.Wendy’s business could be hurt by increased labor costs or labor shortages.Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our company-owned restaurants.  Wendy’s devotes significant resources to recruiting and training its managers and hourly employees.  Increased labor costs due to competition, increased minimum wage or employee benefits costs (including various federal, state and local actions to increase minimum wages and government-mandated health care benefits) or other factors would adversely impact our cost of sales and operating expenses.  In addition, Wendy’s success depends on its ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and staff.  If the brand is unable to do so, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 16The Company, through a subsidiary, has withdrawn from a multiemployer pension plan.  Wendy’s assumed an estimated withdrawal liability in the fourth quarter of 2013, but the final withdrawal liability will be determined through discussions with the pension fund administrator and resolution of a charge filed with the National Labor Relations Board.Prior to the fourth quarter of 2013, the unionized employees at The New Bakery Co. of Ohio, Inc. (the “Bakery”), a 100% owned subsidiary of Wendy’s, now known as The New Bakery Company, LLC, were covered by the Bakery and Confectionery Union and Industry International Pension Fund (the “Union Pension Fund”), a multiemployer pension plan.  The Bakery remitted contributions based on hours worked by covered, unionized employees pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement that expired on March 31, 2013 and the Rehabilitation Plan adopted by the Union Pension Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 due to the underfunded status of the plan.  In December of 2013, the Bakery terminated its participation in the Union Pension Fund and formally notified the plan’s trustees of its withdrawal from the plan.  The  Union Pension Fund administrator has acknowledged the withdrawal, which required Wendy’s to assume an estimated withdrawal liability of $13.5 million based on the applicable requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as amended, and which has been included in “Cost of sales.”  The final withdrawal liability will be determined through discussions between the Bakery and the Union Pension Fund administrator and the resolution of a charge filed with the National Labor Relations Board related to the matter brought by the Bakery and Bakers Local No. 57, Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers & Grain Millers International Union of America, AFL-CIO.  The Bakery believes it has meritorious defenses to the charge.The unionized employees became eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan as of December 5, 2013.Complaints or litigation may hurt the Wendy’s brand.Wendy’s customers file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to a Wendy’s restaurant, or alleging that there was a problem with food quality or operations at a Wendy’s restaurant.  We are also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims from franchisees (which tend to increase when franchisees experience declining sales and profitability) and claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, including class action lawsuits related to these matters.  Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management’s attention away from operations and hurt our performance.  We cannot estimate the aggregate possible range of loss due to most proceedings being in preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur, and significant factual matters unresolved.  In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties.  Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions are thus inherently difficult. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.  Further, adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt us and our franchisees.  Additionally, the restaurant industry has been subject to a number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have contributed to the obesity of certain of their customers.  Adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may harm the reputation of our restaurants, even if the allegations are not directed against our restaurants or are not valid, and even if we are not found liable or the concerns relate only to a single restaurant or a limited number of restaurants.  Moreover, complaints, litigation or adverse publicity experienced by one or more of Wendy’s franchisees could also hurt our business as a whole.We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of the Wendy’s brand and hurt our business.Our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business.  We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and other intellectual property.  The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both existing and new markets.  If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property, either in print or on the Internet, the value of our brand may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the failure of our brand to achieve and maintain market acceptance.  This could harm our image, brand or competitive position and, if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, cause us to incur significant legal fees. 17We franchise our brand to various franchisees.  While we try to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by all of our franchisees, we cannot assure you that these franchisees will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property or the reputation of the Wendy’s restaurant system.  We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions.  The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the United States in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries.  We cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate.  The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.   In addition, we cannot assure you that third parties will not claim infringement by us in the future.  Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause delays in introducing new menu items, require costly modifications to advertising and promotional materials or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.  As a result, any such claim could harm our business and cause a decline in our results of operations and financial condition.Our current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims that may be filed.We currently maintain insurance we believe is adequate for businesses of our size and type.  However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters or acts of terrorism. In addition, we currently self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under workers compensation, general liability and property insurance programs.  Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs, which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Changes in legal or regulatory requirements, including franchising laws, payment card industry rules, overtime rules, minimum wage rates, government-mandated health care benefits, tax legislation, federal ethanol policy and accounting standards, may adversely affect our ability to open new restaurants or otherwise hurt our existing and future operations and results.Each Wendy’s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, safety and other agencies in the state and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located, as well as to Federal laws, rules and regulations and requirements of non-governmental entities such as payment card industry rules. State and local government authorities may enact laws, rules or regulations that impact restaurant operations and the cost of conducting those operations.  There can be no assurance that we and/or our franchisees will not experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants, which could delay the opening of such restaurants in the future.  In addition, more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to tax, zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.  Federal laws, rules and regulations address many aspects of our business, such as franchising, federal ethanol policy, minimum wages and taxes. We and our franchisees are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, along with the ADA, family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted by the states that govern these and other employment law matters.  Changes in laws, rules, regulations and governmental policies could increase our costs and adversely affect our existing and future operations and results.Changes in government-mandated health care benefits under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) are also anticipated to increase our costs and the costs of our franchisees.  Our compliance with the PPACA may result in significant modifications to our employment and benefits policies and practices.  Because of continuing modification of existing regulations and the absence of final implementing regulations, we currently cannot predict the timing or amount of those cost increases or modifications to our business practices.  However, the cost increases may be material and such modifications to our business practices may be disruptive to our operations and impact our ability to attract and retain personnel.Changes in accounting standards, or in the interpretation of existing standards, applicable to us could also affect our future results.  18Wendy’s does not exercise ultimate control over purchasing for its restaurant system, which could harm sales or profitability and the brand.Although Wendy’s  ensures that all suppliers to the Wendy’s system meet quality control standards, Wendy’s franchisees control the purchasing of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies from such suppliers through the purchasing co-op controlled by Wendy’s franchisees, QSCC.  QSCC negotiates national contracts for such food, equipment and supplies.  Wendy’s is entitled to appoint two representatives (of the total of 11) on the board of directors of QSCC and participates in QSCC through its company-owned restaurants, but does not control the decisions and activities of QSCC except to ensure that all suppliers satisfy Wendy’s quality control standards.  If QSCC does not properly estimate the product needs of the Wendy’s system, makes poor purchasing decisions, or decides to cease its operations, system sales and operating costs could be adversely affected and our results of operations and financial condition or the financial condition of Wendy’s franchisees could be hurt. Our international operations are subject to various factors of uncertainty and there is no assurance that international operations will be profitable. In addition to many of the risk factors described throughout this Item 1A, Wendy’s business outside of the United States is subject to a number of additional factors, including international economic and political conditions, risk of corruption and violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws of other countries, differing cultures and consumer preferences, the inability to adapt to international customer preferences, inadequate brand infrastructure within foreign countries to support our international activities, inability to obtain adequate supplies meeting our quality standards and product specifications or interruptions in obtaining such supplies, restrictions on our ability to move cash out of certain foreign countries, currency regulations and fluctuations, diverse government regulations and tax systems, uncertain or differing interpretations of rights and obligations in connection with international franchise agreements and the collection of royalties from international franchisees, the availability and cost of land, construction costs, other legal, financial or regulatory impediments to the development and/or operation of new restaurants, and the availability of experienced management, appropriate franchisees, and joint venture partners.  Although we believe we have developed the support structure required for international growth, there is no assurance that such growth will occur or that international operations will be profitable. To the extent we invest in international company-operated restaurants or joint ventures, we would also have the risk of operating losses related to those restaurants, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We rely on computer systems and information technology to run our business.  Any material failure, interruption or security breach of our computer systems or information technology may result in adverse publicity and adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations. We are significantly dependent upon our computer systems and information technology to properly conduct our business.  A failure or interruption of computer systems or information technology could result in the loss of data, business interruptions or delays in business operations.  Also, despite our considerable efforts and technological resources to secure our computer systems and information technology, security breaches, such as unauthorized access and computer viruses, may occur resulting in system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  A significant security breach of our computer systems or information technology could require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, and incur penalties or other costs that could adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations. Failure to comply with laws, regulations and third-party contracts regarding the collection, maintenance and processing of information may result in adverse publicity and adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations. We collect, maintain and process certain information about customers and employees.  Our use and protection of this information is regulated by various laws and regulations, as well as by third-party contracts.  If our systems or employees fail to comply with these laws, regulations or contract terms, it could require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, increase fees payable to third parties, and incur penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations. We may be required to recognize additional asset impairment and other asset-related charges.We have significant amounts of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets and have incurred impairment charges in the past with respect to those assets.  In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we test for impairment generally annually, or more frequently, if there are indicators of impairment, such as: 19•significant adverse changes in the business climate;•current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with long-lived assets; •a current expectation that more-likely-than-not (e.g., a likelihood that is more than 50%) long-lived assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life; and•a significant drop in our stock price.Based upon future economic and capital market conditions, as well as the operating performance of our reporting units, future impairment charges could be incurred.We enter into swaps and other derivative contracts, which expose us to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties.We have entered into interest rate swaps and other derivative contracts as described in Note 11 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in Item 8 herein, and we may enter into additional swaps in the future.  We are exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on these instruments, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Wendy’s and its subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions, and substantially all of their non-real estate assets are pledged and subject to certain restrictions, under a credit agreement.   On May 16, 2013, Wendy’s amended and restated  its credit agreement, dated May 15, 2012 (the “Restated Credit Agreement”).  The Restated Credit Agreement is comprised of a $350.0 million senior secured term loan facility (“Term A Loans”), a partial refinancing of our existing term loan resulting in a $769.4 million senior secured term loan facility (“Term B Loans”) and a $200.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility.  The Restated Credit Agreement also contains provisions for an uncommitted increase of up to $275.0 million principal amount of the Term B Loans subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.  The revolving credit facility includes a sub-facility for the issuance of up to $70.0 million of letters of credit and allows for liens in the form of cash collateralized letters of credit up to an additional $40.0 million.  During 2013, Wendy’s transitioned the security for all of its outstanding letters of credit from the revolving credit facility to cash collateral.  Therefore, as of December 29, 2013, there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility.  On September 24, 2013, Wendy’s entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to its Restated Credit Agreement to borrow an aggregate principal amount up to $225.0 million of additional Term A Loans (“Incremental Term Loans”).  On October 24, 2013, Wendy’s borrowed $225.0 million of Incremental Term Loans under the Amendment.  The obligations under the Restated Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the non-real estate assets and stock of Wendy’s and its domestic subsidiaries (other than certain unrestricted subsidiaries) and 65% of the stock of certain of its foreign subsidiaries, in each case subject to certain limitations and exceptions.  The affirmative and negative covenants in the Restated Credit Agreement include, among others, preservation of corporate existence; payment of taxes; maintenance of insurance; and limitations on: indebtedness (including guarantee obligations of other indebtedness); liens; mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions; sales of assets; dividends and other payments in respect of capital stock; investments; payments of certain indebtedness; transactions with affiliates; changes in fiscal year; negative pledge clauses and clauses restricting subsidiary distributions; and material changes in lines of business.  The financial covenants contained in the Restated Credit Agreement are (i) a consolidated interest coverage ratio, and (ii) a consolidated senior secured leverage ratio. For purposes of these covenants, “consolidated” means the combined results of Wendy’s and its subsidiaries (other than unrestricted subsidiaries).  The covenants generally do not restrict The Wendy’s Company or any of its subsidiaries that are not subsidiaries of Wendy’s.  If Wendy’s and its subsidiaries are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain the funds necessary to make required payments of interest or principal under, or are unable to comply with covenants of, the Restated Credit Agreement, then Wendy’s would be in default under the terms of the agreement, which would preclude the payment of dividends to The Wendy’s Company, restrict access to the revolving credit facility, and, under certain circumstances, permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness.  See Note 10 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in Item 8 herein, for further information regarding the Restated Credit Agreement.  20Wendy’s has a significant amount of debt outstanding. Such indebtedness, along with the other contractual commitments of our subsidiaries, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to meet debt payment obligations.Wendy’s has a significant amount of debt and debt service requirements.  As of December 29, 2013, on a consolidated basis, there was approximately $1.5 billion of outstanding debt.This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:•making it more difficult to meet payment and other obligations under outstanding debt;•resulting in an event of default if our subsidiaries fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of our subsidiaries’ debt becoming immediately due and payable;•reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;•subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates, including borrowings under the Restated Credit Agreement;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries also have significant contractual requirements for the purchase of soft drinks. Wendy’s has also provided loan guarantees to various lenders on behalf of franchisees entering into debt arrangements for new restaurant development and equipment financing, and one guarantee to a lender for a franchisee, in connection with the refinancing of the franchisee’s debt.  Certain subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have been indemnified.  In addition, certain subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have not been indemnified.  These commitments could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and the ability of our subsidiaries to meet payment obligations.The ability to meet payment and other obligations under the debt instruments of our subsidiaries depends on their ability to generate significant cash flow in the future.  This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control.  We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under existing or any future credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable our subsidiaries to meet their debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs.  If our subsidiaries are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations, they may need to refinance or restructure debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital.  If our subsidiaries are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, they may not be able to meet debt payment and other obligations.We and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could exacerbate further the risks associated with our substantial leverage.We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, in the future.  The terms of the Restated Credit Agreement restrict, but do not completely prohibit, us or our subsidiaries from doing so.  If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current consolidated debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.To service debt and meet its other cash needs, Wendy’s will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be generated or available to it.The ability of Wendy’s to make payments on, or repay or refinance, its debt, including the Restated Credit Agreement, and to fund planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend largely upon its future operating performance. Future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.  In addition, the ability of Wendy’s to borrow funds in the future to make payments on its debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in its credit facilities and other debt agreements, including the Restated Credit Agreement and other agreements it may enter into in the future.  Specifically, Wendy’s will need to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests.  There is no assurance that the Wendy’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from  21operations or that future borrowings will be available under its credit facilities or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its debt or to fund its or The Wendy’s Company’s dividend and other liquidity needs.As a result of the indemnification provisions of the Purchase and Sale Agreement pursuant to which the sale of Arby’s occurred on July 4, 2011, Wendy’s Restaurants may incur expenses and liabilities for taxes related to periods up to the date of sale.As a result of the indemnification provisions of the Purchase and Sale Agreement pursuant to which the sale of Arby’s occurred on July 4, 2011, Wendy’s Restaurants may incur expenses and liabilities for taxes related to periods up to the date of sale, such as income, sales and use, and other operating taxes.  As of December 29, 2013, Wendy’s Restaurants had accrued $0.8 million for certain tax liabilities related to Arby’s which are the obligations of Wendy’s Restaurants pursuant to the indemnification provisions of the Purchase and Sale Agreement and it is possible that further accruals may occur in future periods as audits by various taxing authorities are resolved.  Further accruals in future periods would adversely affect our results of operations.There can be no assurance regarding whether or to what extent the Company will pay dividends on its Common Stock in the future.Holders of the Company’s Common Stock will only be entitled to receive such dividends as its Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments.  Any dividends will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the Company’s earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time.Because the Company is a holding company, its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent upon cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand and cash flows from its subsidiaries.  The ability of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends and/or make loans or advances to the holding company will be dependent upon their respective abilities to achieve sufficient cash flows after satisfying their respective cash requirements, including subsidiary-level debt service and revolving credit agreements, to enable the payment of such dividends or the making of such loans or advances. The ability of any of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or other payments to the Company will also be limited by restrictions in debt instruments currently existing or subsequently entered into by such subsidiaries, including the Restated Credit Agreement, which is described earlier in this Item 1A.A substantial amount of the Company’s Common Stock is concentrated in the hands of certain stockholders.Nelson Peltz, the Company’s Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, Peter May, the Company’s Vice Chairman and former President and Chief Operating Officer, and Edward Garden, a director of the Company, beneficially own shares of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock that collectively constitute more than 24% of its total voting power as of February 26, 2014.  Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden may, from time to time, acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of Common Stock.On December 1, 2011, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Trian Agreement”) with Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden, and several of their affiliates (the “Covered Persons”).  Pursuant to the Trian Agreement, the Board of Directors, including a majority of the independent directors, approved, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“Section 203”), the Covered Persons becoming the owners (as defined in Section 203(c)(9) of the DGCL) of or acquiring an aggregate of up to (and including), but not more than, 32.5% (subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Agreement) of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock, such that no such persons would be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 203 solely as a result of such ownership (such approval, the “Section 203 Approval”).The Trian Agreement (other than the provisions relating to the Section 203 Approval and certain miscellaneous provisions that survive the termination of the agreement) terminated pursuant to the termination provisions of the Trian Agreement after funds affiliated with the Covered Persons sold 16.2 million shares of the Company’s Common Stock on January 15, 2014, thereby decreasing the Covered Persons’ beneficial ownership to less than 25% of the outstanding voting power of the Company as of that date. The terminated provisions of the Trian Agreement included provisions restricting the Covered Persons in the following areas: (i) beneficial ownership of Company voting securities; (ii) solicitation of proxies or submission of a proposal for the vote of stockholders under certain circumstances; (iii) certain affiliate transactions with the Company; and (iv) voting of certain Company voting securities.This concentration of ownership gives Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden significant influence over the outcome of actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets.  They are also in a position to have significant influence to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.  If in the future Messrs. Peltz, May and Garden were to acquire more than a majority of the Company’s  22outstanding voting power, they would be able to determine the outcome of the election of members of the Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring majority stockholder approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets.  They would also be in a position to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.The Company’s certificate of incorporation contains certain anti-takeover provisions and permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and limits its ability to raise capital from affiliates.Certain provisions in the Company’s certificate of incorporation are intended to discourage or delay a hostile takeover of control of the Company.  The Company’s certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of “blank check” preferred stock, which will have such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.  Accordingly, the Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of its common stock.  The preferred stock could be used to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that is determined by the Board of Directors to be undesirable.  Although the Company has no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock, it cannot assure you that it will not do so in the future.The Company’s certificate of incorporation prohibits the issuance of preferred stock to affiliates, unless offered ratably to the holders of the Company’s Common Stock, subject to an exception in the event that the Company is in financial distress and the issuance is approved by its audit committee.  This prohibition limits the ability to raise capital from affiliates"
0,WEN,WENDY'S CO,2013-02-28,"  Risk Factors
.We wish to caution readers that in addition to the important factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we have included below the most significant factors that have affected, or in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results during 2013, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.  Our success depends in part upon the continued retention of certain key personnel.  There were a number of changes in our senior management team in 2011 and 2012, including the appointment of a new President and Chief Executive Officer. We believe that over time our success has been dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management team.  The failure by us to retain members of our senior management team in the future could adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts we have undertaken to increase the efficiency and profitability of our businesses.  Competition from other restaurant companies, or poor customer experience at Wendy's restaurants, could hurt our brand.The market segments in which company-owned and franchised Wendy’s restaurants compete are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, price, food quality and presentation, service, location, convenience, and the nature and condition of the restaurant facility. If customers have a poor experience at a Wendy’s restaurant, whether at a company-owned or franchised restaurant, we may experience a decrease in guest traffic. Further, Wendy’s restaurants compete with a variety of locally-owned restaurants, as well as competitive regional and national chains and franchises.  Several of these chains compete by offering menu items that are targeted at certain consumer groups or dietary trends.  Additionally, many of our competitors have introduced lower cost, value meal menu options.  Our revenues and those of our franchisees may be hurt by this product and price competition.Moreover, new companies, including operators outside the quick service restaurant industry, may enter our market areas and target our customer base.  For example, additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases have come from deli sections and in-store cafes of a number of major grocery store chains, as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets.  Such competitors may have, among other things, lower operating costs, better locations, better facilities, better management, better products, more effective marketing and more efficient operations.  Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, 11marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing and marketing strategies in the quick service restaurant industry better than we can.  Many of our competitors spend significantly more on advertising and marketing than we do, which may give them a competitive advantage through higher levels of brand awareness among consumers.  All such competition may adversely affect our revenues and profits by reducing revenues of company-owned restaurants and royalty payments from franchised restaurants.  Changes in consumer tastes and preferences, and in discretionary consumer spending, could result in a decline in sales at company-owned restaurants and in the royalties that we receive from franchisees.The quick service restaurant industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions, discretionary spending priorities, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants. Our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income.  Accordingly, we may experience declines in sales during economic downturns.  Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending or a decline in consumer food-away-from-home spending could hurt our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.If company-owned and franchised restaurants are unable to adapt to changes in consumer preferences and trends, company-owned and franchised restaurants may lose customers and the resulting revenues from company-owned restaurants and the royalties that we receive from franchisees may decline.The disruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.  The disruptions in the national and global economies have resulted in high unemployment rates and declines in consumer confidence and spending.  If such conditions persist, they may result in significant declines in consumer food-away-from-home spending and customer traffic in our restaurants and those of our franchisees.  There can be no assurance that government responses to the disruptions will restore consumer confidence.  Ongoing disruptions in the national and global economies may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.Changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken and corn), supply, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs could harm results of operations.Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken and corn), supply, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs.  Any increase in these costs, especially beef or chicken prices, could harm operating results.  In addition, our brand is susceptible to increases in these costs as a result of other factors beyond its control, such as weather conditions, global demand, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulations.  Additionally, prices for feed ingredients used to produce beef and chicken could be adversely affected by changes in global weather patterns, which are inherently unpredictable, and by federal ethanol policy.  Increases in gasoline prices would result in the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors, which would increase our costs.  Significant increases in gasoline prices could also result in a decrease in customer traffic at our restaurants, which could adversely affect our business.  We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results.  In addition, we may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to our customers.Shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of perishable food products could damage the Wendy’s brand reputation and adversely affect our operating results. Wendy’s and its franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet brand specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, disease or food-borne illnesses, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which could lower our revenues, increase operating costs, damage brand reputation and otherwise harm our business and the businesses of our franchisees.12Food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. Coli) involving Wendy’s or its supply chain, could create negative publicity and adversely affect sales and operating results.Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe, quality food products. However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. Coli), have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future. Food safety events could adversely affect the price and availability of beef, poultry or other meats. As a result, Wendy’s restaurants could experience a significant increase in food costs if there are food safety events whether or not such events involve Wendy’s restaurants or restaurants of competitors.  In addition, food safety events, whether or not involving Wendy’s, could result in negative publicity for Wendy’s or for the industry or market segments in which we operate.  Increased use of social media could create and/or amplify the effects of negative publicity.  This negative publicity, as well as any other negative publicity concerning types of food products Wendy’s serves, may reduce demand for Wendy’s food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types.  A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could result in a decline in sales and operating results at company-owned restaurants or in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.Consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of beef, poultry, french fries or other products we sell or concerns regarding the effects of disease outbreaks such as “mad cow disease” and avian influenza or “bird flu,” could affect demand for our products.Consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of beef, poultry, french fries or other products we sell or concerns regarding the effects of disease outbreaks such as “mad cow disease” and avian influenza or “bird flu,” could result in less demand for our products and a decline in sales at company-owned restaurants and in the royalties that we receive from franchisees.Increased use of social media could create and/or amplify the effects of negative publicity and adversely affect sales and operating results.Events reported in the media, including social media, whether or not accurate or involving Wendy’s, could create and/or amplify negative publicity for Wendy’s or for the industry or market segments in which we operate.  This could reduce demand for Wendy’s food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types.  A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of negative publicity from social media could result in a decline in sales and operating results at company-owned restaurants or in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.Growth of our restaurant businesses is dependent on new restaurant openings, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.Our restaurant businesses derive earnings from sales at company-owned restaurants, franchise royalties received from franchised restaurants and franchise fees from franchise restaurant operators for each new unit opened.  Growth in our restaurant revenues and earnings is dependent on new restaurant openings.  Numerous factors beyond our control may affect restaurant openings.  These factors include but are not limited to:•our ability to attract new franchisees; •the availability of site locations for new restaurants;•the ability of potential restaurant owners to obtain financing; •the ability of restaurant owners to hire, train and retain qualified operating personnel;•construction and development costs of new restaurants, particularly in highly-competitive markets;•the ability of restaurant owners to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all; and•adverse weather conditions.13Wendy’s franchisees could take actions that could harm our business.Wendy’s franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with the standards set forth in agreements with them.  Wendy’s also provides training and support to franchisees.  However, franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and the franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants.  As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee.  If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with required standards, royalty payments to us will be adversely affected and the brand’s image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.Our success depends on franchisees’ participation in brand strategies.Wendy’s franchisees are an integral part of our business.  Wendy’s may be unable to successfully implement the strategies that it believes are necessary for further growth if franchisees do not participate in that implementation.  Our business and operating results could be adversely affected if a significant number of franchisees do not participate in brand strategies.The Company’s Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at company-owned and participating franchised restaurants or improve our results of operations. Throughout 2013, the Company plans to reimage approximately 100 existing company-owned restaurants and open approximately 25 new company-owned restaurants under its Image Activation program, with plans for significantly more new and reimaged Company and franchisee restaurants in 2014 and beyond. The Company also expects that franchisees will reimage approximately 100 and build 40 new restaurants in 2013. Wendy’s initiated a cash incentive program for franchisees during the third quarter of 2012.  In January 2013, the program was expanded to include variable cash incentives for Tier 1, 2, and 3 remodels and to allow for a maximum of $100,000 each, for up to three incentives per franchisee.  The cash incentive program is for the reimaging of restaurants completed in 2013 and totals $10.0 million.  The Company intends to use its cash on hand and operating cash flows to fund the Image Activation program and new restaurant growth.The Company’s Image Activation program may not positively affect sales at company-owned restaurants or improve results of operations.  There can be no assurance that sales at participating restaurants will achieve or maintain projected levels or that the Company’s results of operations will improve. In addition, most of the Wendy’s system consists of franchised restaurants. Many of our franchisees will need to borrow funds in order to participate in the Image Activation program. Other than the cash incentive program described above, the Company generally does not provide franchisees with financing but it is actively developing third party financing sources for franchisees. If our franchisees are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or not at all, they may be unwilling or unable to invest in the reimaging of their existing restaurants and our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, it is possible that the Company or its subsidiaries may provide other financial incentives to franchisees to participate in the Image Activation program. These incentives could result in additional expense and/or a reduction of royalties or other revenues received from franchisees in the future. If the Company provides incentives to franchisees related to financing of the Image Activation program, the Company may incur costs related to loan guarantees, interest rate subsidies and/or costs related to collectability of loans.Our financial results are affected by the operating results of franchisees.As of December 30, 2012, approximately 78% of the Wendy’s system were franchise restaurants.  We receive revenue in the form of royalties, which are generally based on a percentage of sales at franchised restaurants, rent and fees from franchisees.  Accordingly, a substantial portion of our financial results is to a large extent dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees.  If sales trends or economic conditions worsen for franchisees, their financial results may worsen and our royalty, rent and other fee revenues may decline.  In addition, accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts may increase.  When company-owned restaurants are sold, one of our subsidiaries is often required to remain responsible for lease payments for these restaurants to the extent that the purchasing franchisees default on their leases.  During periods of declining sales and profitability of franchisees, the incidence of franchisee defaults for these lease payments increases and we are then required to make those payments and seek recourse against the franchisee or agree to repayment terms.  Additionally, if franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements, or if we decide to restructure franchise agreements in order to induce franchisees to renew these agreements, then our royalty revenues may decrease.  Further, we may decide from time to time to acquire restaurants from franchisees that experience significant financial hardship, which may reduce our cash and equivalents.14Wendy’s may be unable to manage effectively the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, which could adversely affect our business and financial results. Wendy’s has from time to time acquired the interests of and sold Wendy’s restaurants to franchisees.  Wendy’s intends to evaluate strategic acquisitions of franchised restaurants and strategic dispositions of company-owned restaurants to existing and new franchisees.  The success of these transactions is dependent upon the availability of sellers and buyers, the availability of financing, and the brand’s ability to negotiate transactions on terms deemed acceptable.  In addition, the operations of restaurants that the brand acquires may not be integrated successfully, and the intended benefits of such transactions may not be realized.  Acquisitions of franchised restaurants pose various risks to brand operations, including: •diversion of management attention to the integration of acquired restaurant operations;•increased operating expenses and the inability to achieve expected cost savings and operating efficiencies;•exposure to liabilities arising out of sellers’ prior operations of acquired restaurants; and•incurrence or assumption of debt to finance acquisitions or improvements and/or the assumption of long-term, non-cancelable leases.In addition, engaging in acquisitions and dispositions places increased demands on the brand’s operational and financial management resources and may require us to continue to expand these resources.  If Wendy’s is unable to manage the acquisition and disposition of restaurants effectively, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.Current restaurant locations may become unattractive, and attractive new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all. The success of any restaurant depends in substantial part on its location. There can be no assurance that our current restaurant locations will continue to be attractive as demographic patterns change. Neighborhood or economic conditions where our restaurants are located could decline in the future, thus resulting in potentially reduced sales in those locations. In addition, rising real estate prices in some areas may restrict our ability and the ability of franchisees to purchase or lease new desirable locations. If desirable locations cannot be obtained at reasonable prices, the brand’s ability to execute its growth strategies will be adversely affected.Wendy’s leasing and ownership of significant amounts of real estate exposes it to possible liabilities and losses, including liabilities associated with environmental matters. As of December 30, 2012, Wendy’s leased or owned the land and/or the building for 1,427 Wendy’s restaurants. Accordingly,  we are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate. In particular, the value of our real property assets could decrease, and costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends, supply or demand for the use of the restaurants, which may result from competition from similar restaurants in the area, and liability for environmental matters.Wendy’s is subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances. These environmental laws provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner, operator or occupant of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. Third parties may also make claims against owners, operators or occupants of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such substances.  A number of our restaurant sites were formerly gas stations or are adjacent to current or former gas stations, or were used for other commercial activities that can create environmental impacts. We may also acquire or lease these types of sites in the future. We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of all of our properties. We may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our leased and owned properties, and any such liabilities identified in the future could cause us to incur significant costs, including costs associated with litigation, fines or clean-up responsibilities.  In addition, we cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted.  We cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with any environmental laws or regulations or to satisfy any such claims.  See “Item 1. Business - General - Environmental and Other Matters.” Wendy’s leases real property generally for initial terms of 20 years with two to four additional options to extend the term of the leases in consecutive five-year increments. Many leases provide that the landlord may increase the rent over the term of the lease and any renewals thereof. Most leases require us to pay all of the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. We generally cannot cancel these leases. If an existing or future restaurant is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless 15be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each lease expires, we may fail to negotiate additional renewals or renewal options, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations.Due to the concentration of Wendy’s restaurants in particular geographic regions, our business results could be impacted by the adverse economic conditions prevailing in those regions regardless of the state of the national economy as a whole.As of December 30, 2012, we and our franchisees operated Wendy’s restaurants in 50 states, the District of Columbia and 27 foreign countries and territories.  As of December 30, 2012 and as detailed in “Item 2. Properties,” the 8 leading states by number of operating units were: Florida, Ohio, Texas, Georgia, Michigan, California, Pennsylvania and North Carolina.  This geographic concentration can cause economic conditions in particular areas of the country to have a disproportionate impact on our overall results of operations.  It is possible that adverse economic conditions in states or regions that contain a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the future.Our operations are influenced by adverse weather conditions.Weather, which is unpredictable, can impact Wendy’s restaurant sales.  Harsh weather conditions that keep customers from dining out result in lost opportunities for our restaurants.  A heavy snowstorm in the Northeast or Midwest or a hurricane in the Southeast can shut down an entire metropolitan area, resulting in a reduction in sales in that area.  Our first quarter includes winter months and historically has a lower level of sales at company-owned restaurants.  Because a significant portion of our restaurant operating costs is fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of sales during these periods hurts our operating margins, and can result in restaurant operating losses.  For these reasons, a quarter-to-quarter comparison may not be a good indication of Wendy’s performance or how it may perform in the future.Wendy’s business could be hurt by increased labor costs or labor shortages.Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our company-owned restaurants.  Wendy’s devotes significant resources to recruiting and training its managers and hourly employees.  Increased labor costs due to competition, increased minimum wage or employee benefits costs (including government-mandated health care benefits) or other factors would adversely impact our cost of sales and operating expenses.  In addition, Wendy’s success depends on its ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and staff.  If the brand is unable to do so, our results of operations could be adversely affected.The Company, through a subsidiary, could become obligated to pay additional contributions due to the unfunded vested benefits of a multiemployer pension plan.  A future incurrence of withdrawal liability could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations. The unionized employees at The New Bakery Co. of Ohio, Inc. (the “Bakery”), a 100% owned subsidiary of Wendy’s, are covered by the Bakery and Confectionery Union and Industry International Pension Fund (the “Union Pension Fund”), a multiemployer pension plan with a plan year end of December 31 that provides defined benefits to certain employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement (the “CBA”).  In 2010, the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement (the “New CBA”) which expires on March 31, 2013, were agreed to by the Bakery and Bakers Local No. 57, Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers & Grain Millers International Union of America, AFL-CIO.  Included in the terms of the New CBA, the Bakery agreed to participate in the Union Pension Fund. The future cost of the Union Pension Fund depends on a number of factors, including the funding status of the plan and the ability of other participating companies to meet ongoing funding obligations. Participating employers in the Union Pension Fund are jointly responsible for any plan underfunding.  Assets contributed to the Union Pension Fund are not segregated or otherwise restricted to provide benefits only to the employees of the Bakery.  While Wendy’s pension cost for the Union Pension Fund is established by the New CBA, the Union Pension Fund may impose increased contribution rates and surcharges based on the funded status of the plan and in accordance with the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the “PPA”), which requires underfunded multiemployer pension plans to implement rehabilitation plans to improve funded status.  Factors that could impact the funded status of the Union Pension Fund include investment performance, changes in the participant demographics, financial stability of contributing employers and changes in actuarial assumptions.  As of January 1, 2012, the Union Pension Fund was in Green Zone Status, as defined in the PPA and had been operating under a Rehabilitation Plan. In April 2012, Wendy’s received a Notice of Critical Status from the Union Pension Fund which sets forth that the plan was considered to be in Red Zone Status, as defined in the PPA, for the 2012 plan year due to funding problems.  As the fund is in 16critical status, all contributing employers, including Wendy’s, will be required to pay a 5% surcharge on contributions for all hours worked from June 1, 2012 through December 30, 2012 and a 10% surcharge on contributions for all hours worked on and after January 1, 2013 until a contribution rate is negotiated at the expiration of the New CBA that will be consistent with a revised Rehabilitation Plan which must be adopted by the Union Pension Fund in accordance with the provisions of the PPA.    The surcharges and the possible effect of the revised Rehabilitation Plan to be adopted by the Union Pension Fund as described above are not anticipated to have a material effect on the Company's results of operations.  However, in the event other contributing employers are unable to, or fail to, meet their ongoing funding obligations, the financial impact on the Company to contribute to any plan underfunding may be material.      Wendy’s could also be obligated to pay additional contributions (known as complete or partial withdrawal liabilities) due to the unfunded vested benefits of the Union Pension Fund.  The withdrawal liability (which could be material) would equal Wendy’s proportionate share of the unfunded vested benefits based on the year in which the liability is triggered.  A withdrawal liability would be triggered if Wendy’s (1) ceases to make contributions to the Union Pension Fund, (2) closes its bakery facility, or (3) decides not to renew the collective bargaining agreement.  No factors for which the Bakery would incur a withdrawal liability occurred during fiscal 2012.  A future incurrence of withdrawal liability could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations.Complaints or litigation may hurt the Wendy’s brand.Wendy’s customers file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to a Wendy’s restaurant, or alleging that there was a problem with food quality or operations at a Wendy’s restaurant.  We are also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims from franchisees (which tend to increase when franchisees experience declining sales and profitability) and claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, including class action lawsuits related to these matters.  Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management’s attention away from operations and hurt our performance.  We cannot estimate the aggregate possible range of loss due to most proceedings being in preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur, and significant factual matters unresolved.  In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties.  Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions are thus inherently difficult. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.  Further, adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt us and our franchisees.  Additionally, the restaurant industry has been subject to a number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of certain of their customers.  Adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may harm the reputation of our restaurants, even if the allegations are not directed against our restaurants or are not valid, and even if we are not found liable or the concerns relate only to a single restaurant or a limited number of restaurants.  Moreover, complaints, litigation or adverse publicity experienced by one or more of Wendy’s franchisees could also hurt our business as a whole.We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of the Wendy’s brand and hurt our business.Our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business.  We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and other intellectual property.  The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both existing and new markets. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property, either in print or on the Internet, the value of our brand may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the failure of our brand to achieve and maintain market acceptance.  This could harm our image, brand or competitive position and, if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, cause us to incur significant legal fees.We franchise our brand to various franchisees.  While we try to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by all of our franchisees, we cannot assure you that these franchisees will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property or the reputation of the Wendy’s restaurant system.  We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions.  The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the United States in 17which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries.  We cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate.  The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.   In addition, we cannot assure you that third parties will not claim infringement by us in the future.  Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause delays in introducing new menu items, require costly modifications to advertising and promotional materials or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.  As a result, any such claim could harm our business and cause a decline in our results of operations and financial condition.Our current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims that may be filed.We currently maintain insurance we believe is adequate for businesses of our size and type.  However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters or acts of terrorism.  In addition, we currently self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under workers compensation, general liability and property insurance programs.  Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs, which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Changes in legal or regulatory requirements, including franchising laws, payment card industry rules, overtime rules, minimum wage rates, government-mandated health care benefits, tax legislation, federal ethanol policy and accounting standards, may hurt our ability to open new restaurants or otherwise hurt our existing and future operations and results.Each Wendy’s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, safety and other agencies in the state and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located, as well as to Federal laws, rules and regulations and requirements of non-governmental entities such as payment card industry rules. State and local government authorities may enact laws, rules or regulations that impact restaurant operations and the cost of conducting those operations.  There can be no assurance that we and/or our franchisees will not experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants, which could delay the opening of such restaurants in the future.  In addition, more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to tax, zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.  Federal laws, rules and regulations address many aspects of our business, such as franchising, federal ethanol policy, minimum wages and taxes. We and our franchisees are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, along with the ADA, family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted by the states that govern these and other employment law matters.  Changes in accounting standards, or in the interpretation of existing standards, applicable to us could also affect our future results. Changes in government-mandated health care benefits under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) are also anticipated to increase our costs and the costs of our franchisees. Our compliance with the PPACA may result in significant modifications to our employment and benefits policies and practices.  Because of the absence of final implementing regulations, we currently cannot predict the timing or amount of those cost increases or modifications to our business practices.  However, the cost increases may be material and such modifications to our business practices may be disruptive to our operations and impact our ability to attract and retain personnel.Wendy’s does not exercise ultimate control over purchasing for its restaurant system, which could harm sales or profitability and the brand.Although Wendy’s  ensures that all suppliers to the Wendy’s system meet quality control standards, Wendy’s franchisees control the purchasing of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies from such suppliers through the purchasing co-op controlled by Wendy’s franchisees, QSCC.  QSCC negotiates national contracts for such food, equipment and supplies.  Wendy’s is entitled to appoint two representatives (of the total of 11) on the board of directors of QSCC and participates in QSCC through its company-owned restaurants, but does not control the decisions and activities of QSCC except to ensure that all suppliers satisfy Wendy’s quality control standards.  If QSCC does not properly estimate the product needs of the Wendy’s system, makes poor purchasing decisions, or decides to cease its operations, system sales and operating costs could be adversely affected and our results of operations and financial condition or the financial condition of Wendy’s franchisees could be hurt. 18Our international operations are subject to various factors of uncertainty and there is no assurance that international operations will be profitable. In addition to many of the risk factors described throughout this Item 1A, Wendy’s business outside of the United States is subject to a number of additional factors, including international economic and political conditions, risk of corruption and violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws of other countries, differing cultures and consumer preferences, the inability to adapt to international customer preferences, inadequate brand infrastructure within foreign countries to support our international activities, inability to obtain adequate supplies meeting our quality standards and product specifications or interruptions in obtaining such supplies, currency regulations and fluctuations, diverse government regulations and tax systems, uncertain or differing interpretations of rights and obligations in connection with international franchise agreements and the collection of royalties from international franchisees, the availability and cost of land, construction costs, other legal, financial or regulatory impediments to the development and/or operation of new restaurants, and the availability of experienced management, appropriate franchisees, and joint venture partners. Although we believe we have developed the support structure required for international growth, there is no assurance that such growth will occur or that international operations will be profitable. To the extent we invest in international company-operated restaurants or joint ventures, we would also have the risk of operating losses related to those restaurants, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We rely on computer systems and information technology to run our business.  Any material failure, interruption or security breach of our computer systems or information technology may result in adverse publicity and adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations. We are significantly dependent upon our computer systems and information technology to properly conduct our business. A failure or interruption of computer systems or information technology could result in the loss of data, business interruptions or delays in business operations. Also, despite our considerable efforts and technological resources to secure our computer systems and information technology, security breaches, such as unauthorized access and computer viruses, may occur resulting in system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  A significant security breach of our computer systems or information technology could require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, and incur penalties or other costs that could adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations. Failure to comply with laws, regulations and third party contracts regarding the collection, maintenance and processing of information may result in adverse publicity and adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations. We collect, maintain and process certain information about customers and employees.  Our use and protection of this information is regulated by various laws and regulations, as well as by third party contracts.  If our systems or employees fail to comply with these laws, regulations or contract terms, it could require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, increase fees payable to third parties, and incur penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations. We may be required to recognize additional asset impairment and other asset-related charges.We have significant amounts of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets and have incurred impairment charges in the past with respect to those assets. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we test for impairment generally annually, or more frequently, if there are indicators of impairment, such as:•significant adverse changes in the business climate;•current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with long-lived assets; •a current expectation that more-likely-than-not (e.g., a likelihood that is more than 50%) long-lived assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life; and•a significant drop in our stock price.Based upon future economic and capital market conditions, as well as the operating performance of our reporting units, future impairment charges could be incurred.19We enter into swaps and other derivative contracts, which expose us to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties.We have entered into interest rate swaps and other derivative contracts as described in Note 13 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in Item 8 herein, and we may enter into additional swaps in the future.  We are exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on these instruments, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Wendy’s and its subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions, and substantially all of their non-real estate assets are pledged and subject to certain restrictions, under a Credit Agreement.  In May 2012, Wendy’s entered into a Credit Agreement, as amended (the “Credit Agreement”), which includes a senior secured term loan facility of $1,125.0 million and a senior secured revolving credit facility of $200.0 million.  The Credit Agreement also contains provisions for an uncommitted increase of up to $275.0 million principal amount of the revolving credit facility and/or term loan subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The revolving credit facility includes a sub-facility for the issuance of up to $70.0 million of letters of credit. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the non-real estate assets of Wendy’s and its domestic subsidiaries (other than certain unrestricted subsidiaries), the stock of its domestic subsidiaries (other than certain unrestricted subsidiaries), and 65% of the stock of certain of its foreign subsidiaries, in each case subject to certain limitations and exceptions.  The affirmative and negative covenants in the Credit Agreement include, among others, preservation of corporate existence; payment of taxes; and maintenance of insurance; and limitations on: indebtedness (including guarantee obligations of other indebtedness); liens; mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions; sales of assets; dividends and other payments in respect of capital stock; investments; payments of certain indebtedness; transactions with affiliates; changes in fiscal year; negative pledge clauses and clauses restricting subsidiary distributions; and material changes in lines of business.  The financial covenants contained in the Credit Agreement are (i) a consolidated interest coverage ratio, and (ii) a consolidated senior secured leverage ratio. For purposes of these covenants, “consolidated” means the combined results of Wendy’s and its subsidiaries (other than unrestricted subsidiaries).  The covenants generally do not restrict The Wendy’s Company or any of its subsidiaries that are not subsidiaries of Wendy’s.  If Wendy’s and its subsidiaries are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain the funds necessary to make required payments of interest or principal under, or are unable to comply with covenants of, the Credit Agreement, then Wendy’s would be in default under the terms of the agreement, which would preclude the payment of dividends to The Wendy’s Company, restrict access to the revolving credit facility, and, under certain circumstances, permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness.  See Note 12 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in Item 8 herein, for further information regarding the Credit Agreement. Wendy’s has a significant amount of debt outstanding. Such indebtedness, along with the other contractual commitments of our subsidiaries, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to meet debt payment obligations.Wendy’s has a significant amount of debt and debt service requirements. As of December 30, 2012, on a consolidated basis, there was approximately $1.5 billion of outstanding debt.This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:•making it more difficult to meet payment and other obligations under outstanding debt;•resulting in an event of default if our subsidiaries fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of our subsidiaries’ debt becoming immediately due and payable;•reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;•subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates, including borrowings under the Credit Agreement;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries also have significant contractual requirements for the purchase of soft drinks. Wendy’s has also provided loan guarantees to various lenders on behalf of franchisees entering into pooled debt facility arrangements for 20new store development and equipment financing, and one guarantee to a lender for a franchisee, in connection with the refinancing of the franchisee’s debt.  Certain subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have been indemnified. In addition, certain subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have not been indemnified. These commitments could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and the ability of our subsidiaries to meet payment obligations.The ability to meet payment and other obligations under the debt instruments of our subsidiaries depends on their ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under existing or any future credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable our subsidiaries to meet their debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs.  If our subsidiaries are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations, they may need to refinance or restructure debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital.  If our subsidiaries are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, they may not be able to meet debt payment and other obligations.We and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could exacerbate further the risks associated with our substantial leverage.We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, in the future. The terms of the Credit Agreement restrict, but do not completely prohibit, us or our subsidiaries from doing so.  If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current consolidated debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.To service debt and meet its other cash needs, Wendy’s will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be generated or available to it.The ability of Wendy’s to make payments on, or repay or refinance, its debt, including the Credit Agreement, and to fund planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend largely upon its future operating performance. Future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, the ability of Wendy’s to borrow funds in the future to make payments on its debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in its credit facilities and other debt agreements, including the Credit Agreement and other agreements it may enter into in the future. Specifically, Wendy’s will need to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests. There is no assurance that the Wendy’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under its credit facilities or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its debt or to fund its or The Wendy’s Company’s dividend and other liquidity needs.As a result of the indemnification provisions of the Purchase and Sale Agreement pursuant to which the sale of Arby’s occurred on July 4, 2011, Wendy’s Restaurants may incur expenses and liabilities for taxes related to periods up to the date of sale.As a result of the indemnification provisions of the Purchase and Sale Agreement pursuant to which the sale of Arby’s occurred on July 4, 2011, Wendy’s Restaurants may incur expenses and liabilities for taxes related to periods up to the date of sale, such as income, sales and use, and other operating taxes.  As of December 30, 2012, Wendy’s Restaurants had accrued $1.3 million for certain tax liabilities related to Arby’s which are the obligations of Wendy’s Restaurants pursuant to the indemnification provisions of the Purchase and Sale Agreement and it is possible that further accruals may occur in future periods as audits by various taxing authorities are resolved.  Further accruals in future periods would adversely affect our results of operationsThere can be no assurance regarding whether or to what extent the Company will pay dividends on its Common Stock in the future.Holders of the Company’s Common Stock will only be entitled to receive such dividends as its Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments.  Any dividends will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the Company’s earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time.Because the Company is a holding company, its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent upon cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand and cash flows from its subsidiaries.  The ability of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends and/or make loans or advances to the holding company will be dependent upon their respective abilities to achieve sufficient cash flows after satisfying their respective cash requirements, including subsidiary-level debt service and revolving credit agreements, 21to enable the payment of such dividends or the making of such loans or advances. The ability of any of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or other payments to the Company will also be limited by restrictions in debt instruments currently existing or subsequently entered into by such subsidiaries, including the Credit Agreement, which is described earlier in this Item 1A.A substantial amount of the Company’s Common Stock is concentrated in the hands of certain stockholders.Nelson Peltz, the Company’s Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, and Peter May, the Company’s Vice Chairman and former President and Chief Operating Officer, beneficially own shares of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock that collectively constitute more than 25% of its total voting power.  Messrs. Peltz and May may, from time to time, acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of Common Stock.  On December 1, 2011, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Trian Agreement”) with Messrs. Peltz and May and several of their affiliates (the “Covered Persons”).  Pursuant to the Trian Agreement, the Board of Directors (the “Board”), including a majority of the independent directors, approved, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“Section 203”), the Covered Persons becoming the owners (as defined in Section 203(c)(9) of the DGCL) of or acquiring an aggregate of up to (and including), but not more than, 32.5% (subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Agreement, the “Maximum Percentage”) of the outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock, such that no such persons would be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 203 solely as a result of such ownership (such approval, the “Section 203 Approval”). Pursuant to the Trian Agreement, each of the Covered Persons has agreed that, for so long as the Company has a class of equity securities listed on any national securities exchange, (i) he will not purchase or cause to be purchased, or otherwise acquire, beneficial ownership of Company voting securities that would increase the aggregate beneficial ownership of Company voting securities by the Covered Persons above the Maximum Percentage; (ii) he will not solicit proxies or submit any proposal for the vote of stockholders of the Company or recommend or request or induce any other person to take any such actions or seek to advise, encourage or influence any other person with respect to the Shares, in each case, if the result of such action would be to cause the Board to be comprised of less than a majority of independent directors; (iii) he will not engage in certain affiliate transactions with the Company without the prior approval of a majority of the Audit Committee of the Board or other committee of the Board that is comprised of independent directors; and (iv) except with respect to certain pledged shares, each of the Covered Persons shall cause the Company voting securities owned by it to be present at stockholder meetings for the purposes of establishing a quorum and shall vote any Company voting securities in excess of the shares beneficially owned by them on the date of the Trian Agreement either as recommended by the Board or in the same proportion as Company voting securities not owned by the Covered Persons are actually voted, subject to certain limited exceptions.The Trian Agreement (other than the provisions relating to the Section 203 Approval and certain miscellaneous provisions that survive the termination of the Agreement) will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the Covered Persons ceasing to own in the aggregate 25% of the outstanding voting power of the Company, (ii) December 1, 2014, (iii) at such time as the Company’s Common Stock is no longer listed on a national securities exchange, and (iv) such time as any person other than the Covered Persons or any Affiliate, Associate of, or member of a Schedule 13D group with, the Covered Persons, (a) makes an offer to purchase (x) an amount of shares that when added to the number of shares already beneficially owned by such person and its affiliates and associates equals or exceeds 50% of the outstanding voting power of the Company or (y) all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, (b) solicits proxies with respect to a majority slate of directors or (c) commences or announces an intention to commence a solicitation of proxies, becomes a “participant” in a “solicitation” or assists any “participant” in, a “solicitation” (as such terms are defined in Rule 14a-1 of Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), or submits any proposal for the vote of stockholders of the Company, or recommends or requests or induces or attempts to induce any other person to take any such actions, or to seek to advise, encourage or influence any other person with respect to the voting of Company voting securities, in each case, if the result of any such proposal or solicitation would be to change a majority of the persons serving as directors on the Board.This concentration of ownership gives Messrs. Peltz and May significant influence over the outcome of actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets.  They are also in a position to have significant influence to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.  If in the future Messrs. Peltz and May were to acquire more than a majority of the Company’s outstanding voting power, they would be able to determine the outcome of the election of members of the Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring majority stockholder approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets.  They would also be in a position to prevent or cause a change in control of the Company.22The Company’s certificate of incorporation contains certain anti-takeover provisions and permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and limits its ability to raise capital from affiliates.Certain provisions in the Company’s certificate of incorporation are intended to discourage or delay a hostile takeover of control of the Company.  The Company’s certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of “blank check” preferred stock, which will have such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.  Accordingly, the Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of its common stock.  The preferred stock could be used to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that is determined by the Board of Directors to be undesirable.  Although the Company has no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock, it cannot assure you that it will not do so in the future.The Company’s certificate of incorporation prohibits the issuance of preferred stock to affiliates, unless offered ratably to the holders of the Company’s Common Stock, subject to an exception in the event that the Company is in financial distress and the issuance is approved by its audit committee.  This prohibition limits the ability to raise capital from affiliates"
1,WEN,WENDY'S CO,2012-03-01,"  Risk Factors
.We wish to caution readers that in addition to the important factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we have included below the most significant factors that have affected, or in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results during 2012, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.  Risks Related to The Wendy’s Company and Wendy’s RestaurantsOur success depends in part upon the continued retention of certain key personnel.  In addition, we are relocating the Atlanta restaurant support center.There were a number of changes in our senior management team in 2011, including the appointment of a new President and Chief Executive Officer. We believe that over time our success has been dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management team.  The failure by us to retain members of our senior management team in the future could adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts we have undertaken to increase the efficiency and profitability of our businesses.  We expect to incur significant costs in 2012 for the closure of the Atlanta restaurant support center and its relocation to Ohio for employee severance, retention, recruiting and relocation.  In addition, we may incur redundant compensation costs for staff overlap during the relocation transition. We anticipate that our relocation activities will be substantially completed by the third quarter of 2012.  During the relocation transition period, we are likely to not retain the services of some experienced corporate personnel, which could distract from and adversely impact the performance of certain corporate, control and administrative functions.Competition from other restaurant companies, or poor customer experience at Wendy’s restaurants, could hurt our brand.The market segments in which company-owned and franchised Wendy’s restaurants compete are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, price, food quality and presentation, service, location, convenience, and the nature and condition of the restaurant facility. If customers have a poor experience at a Wendy’s restaurant, whether at a company-owned or franchised restaurant, we may experience a decrease in guest traffic. Further, Wendy’s restaurants compete with a variety of locally-owned restaurants, as well as competitive regional and national chains and franchises.  Several of these chains compete by offering menu items that are targeted at certain consumer groups or dietary trends.  Additionally, many of our competitors have introduced lower cost, value meal menu options.  Our revenues and those of our franchisees may be hurt by this product and price competition.Moreover, new companies, including operators outside the quick service restaurant industry, may enter our market areas and target our customer base.  For example, additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases have come from deli sections and in-store cafes of a number of major grocery store chains, as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets.  Such competitors may have, among other things, lower operating costs, better locations, better facilities, better management, better products, more effective marketing and more efficient operations.  Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing and marketing strategies in the quick service restaurant industry better than we can.  Many of our competitors spend significantly more on advertising and marketing than we do, which may give them a competitive advantage through higher levels of brand awareness among consumers.  All such competition may adversely affect our revenues and profits by reducing revenues of company-owned restaurants and royalty payments from franchised restaurants.  Changes in consumer tastes and preferences, and in discretionary consumer spending, could result in a decline in sales at company-owned restaurants and in the royalties that we receive from franchisees.The quick service restaurant industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions, discretionary spending priorities, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants. Our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income.  Accordingly, we may experience declines in sales during economic downturns.  Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending or a decline in consumer food-away-from-home spending could hurt our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.13If company-owned and franchised restaurants are unable to adapt to changes in consumer preferences and trends, company-owned and franchised restaurants may lose customers and the resulting revenues from company-owned restaurants and the royalties that we receive from franchisees may decline.The disruptions in the national and global economies and the financial markets may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.  The disruptions in the national and global economies and financial markets, and the related reductions in the availability of credit, have resulted in high unemployment rates and declines in consumer confidence and spending, and have made it more difficult for businesses to obtain financing.  If such conditions persist, then they may result in significant declines in consumer food-away-from-home spending and customer traffic in our restaurants and those of our franchisees.  Such conditions may also adversely impact the ability of franchisees to build or purchase restaurants, remodel existing restaurants, renew expiring franchise agreements and make timely royalty and other payments.  There can be no assurance that government responses to the disruptions and volatility in the financial markets will restore consumer confidence, stabilize the markets or increase liquidity and the availability of credit.  If we or our franchisees are unable to obtain borrowed funds on acceptable terms, or if conditions in the economy and the financial markets do not improve, our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition could be adversely affected.Additionally, we have entered into interest rate swaps and other derivative contracts as described in Note 13 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in Item 8 herein, and we may enter into additional swaps in the future.  We are exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on these instruments, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken and corn), supply, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs could harm results of operations.Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs (including beef, chicken and corn), supply, fuel, distribution and other operating costs.  Any increase in these costs, especially beef or chicken prices, could harm operating results.  In addition, our brand is susceptible to increases in these costs as a result of other factors beyond its control, such as weather conditions, global demand, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulations.  Additionally, prices for feed ingredients used to produce beef and chicken could be adversely affected by changes in global weather patterns, which are inherently unpredictable.  Increases in gasoline prices would result in the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors, which would increase our costs.  Significant increases in gasoline prices could also result in a decrease in customer traffic at our restaurants, which could adversely affect our business.  We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results.  In addition, we may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to our customers.Shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of perishable food products could damage the Wendy’s brand reputation and adversely affect our operating results. Wendy’s and its franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet brand specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, disease or food-borne illnesses, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which could lower our revenues, increase operating costs, damage brand reputation and otherwise harm our business and the businesses of our franchisees.Food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. Coli) involving Wendy’s or its supply chain, could create negative publicity and adversely affect sales at the brand.Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe, quality food products. However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. Coli), have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future. Food safety events could adversely affect the price and availability of beef, poultry or other meats. As a result, Wendy’s restaurants could experience a significant increase in food costs if there are food safety events whether or not such events involve Wendy’s restaurants or restaurants of competitors.  14In addition, food safety events, whether or not involving Wendy’s, could result in negative publicity for Wendy’s or for the industry or market segments in which we operate.  This negative publicity, as well as any other negative publicity concerning types of food products Wendy’s serves, may reduce demand for Wendy’s food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to other products or food types.  A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could result in a decline in sales at company-owned restaurants or in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants. Consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of beef, poultry, french fries or other products we sell or concerns regarding the effects of disease outbreaks such as “mad cow disease” and avian influenza or “bird flu,” could affect demand for our products.Consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of beef, poultry, french fries or other products we sell or concerns regarding the effects of disease outbreaks such as “mad cow disease” and avian influenza or “bird flu,” could result in less demand for our products and a decline in sales at company-owned restaurants and in the royalties that we receive from franchisees.Growth of our restaurant businesses is significantly dependent on new restaurant openings, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.Our restaurant businesses derive earnings from sales at company-owned restaurants, franchise royalties received from franchised restaurants and franchise fees from franchise restaurant operators for each new unit opened.  Growth in our restaurant revenues and earnings is significantly dependent on new restaurant openings.  Numerous factors beyond our control may affect restaurant openings.  These factors include but are not limited to:•our ability to attract new franchisees; •the availability of site locations for new restaurants;•the ability of potential restaurant owners to obtain financing; •the ability of restaurant owners to hire, train and retain qualified operating personnel;•construction and development costs of new restaurants, particularly in highly-competitive markets;•the ability of restaurant owners to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all; and•adverse weather conditions.Wendy’s franchisees could take actions that could harm our business.Wendy’s franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with the standards set forth in agreements with them.  Wendy’s also provides training and support to franchisees.  However, franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and the franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants.  As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee.  If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with required standards, royalty payments to us will be adversely affected and the brand’s image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.Our success depends on franchisees’ participation in brand strategies.Wendy’s franchisees are an integral part of our business.  Wendy’s may be unable to successfully implement the strategies that it believes are necessary for further growth if franchisees do not participate in that implementation.  Our business and operating results could be adversely affected if a significant number of franchisees do not participate in brand strategies.15Our financial results are affected by the operating results of franchisees.As of January 1, 2012, approximately 79% of the Wendy’s system were franchise restaurants.  We receive revenue in the form of royalties, which are generally based on a percentage of sales at franchised restaurants, rent and fees from franchisees.  Accordingly, a substantial portion of our financial results is to a large extent dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees.  If sales trends or economic conditions worsen for franchisees, their financial results may worsen and our royalty, rent and other fee revenues may decline.  In addition, accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts may increase.  When company-owned restaurants are sold, one of our subsidiaries is often required to remain responsible for lease payments for these restaurants to the extent that the purchasing franchisees default on their leases.  During periods of declining sales and profitability of franchisees, the incidence of franchisee defaults for these lease payments increases and we are then required to make those payments and seek recourse against the franchisee or agree to repayment terms.  Additionally, if franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements, or if we decide to restructure franchise agreements in order to induce franchisees to renew these agreements, then our royalty revenues may decrease.  Further, we may decide from time to time to acquire restaurants from franchisees that experience significant financial hardship, which may reduce our cash and equivalents.Wendy’s may be unable to manage effectively the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, which could adversely affect our business and financial results. Wendy’s acquires restaurants from franchisees and in some cases “re-franchises” restaurants by selling them to new or existing franchisees.  The success of these transactions is dependent upon the availability of sellers and buyers, the availability of financing, and the brand’s ability to negotiate transactions on terms deemed acceptable.  In addition, the operations of restaurants that the brand acquires may not be integrated successfully, and the intended benefits of such transactions may not be realized.  Acquisitions of franchised restaurants pose various risks to brand operations, including: •diversion of management attention to the integration of acquired restaurant operations;•increased operating expenses and the inability to achieve expected cost savings and operating efficiencies;•exposure to liabilities arising out of sellers’ prior operations of acquired restaurants; and•incurrence or assumption of debt to finance acquisitions or improvements and/or the assumption of long-term, non-cancelable leases.In addition, engaging in acquisitions and dispositions places increased demands on the brand’s operational and financial management resources and may require us to continue to expand these resources.  If Wendy’s is unable to manage the acquisition and disposition of restaurants effectively, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.Current restaurant locations may become unattractive, and attractive new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all. The success of any restaurant depends in substantial part on its location. There can be no assurance that our current restaurant locations will continue to be attractive as demographic patterns change. Neighborhood or economic conditions where our restaurants are located could decline in the future, thus resulting in potentially reduced sales in those locations. In addition, rising real estate prices in some areas may restrict our ability and the ability of franchisees to purchase or lease new desirable locations. If desirable locations cannot be obtained at reasonable prices, the brand’s ability to execute its growth strategies will be adversely affected.Wendy’s leasing and ownership of significant amounts of real estate exposes it to possible liabilities and losses, including liabilities associated with environmental matters. As of January 1, 2012, Wendy’s leased or owned the land and/or the building for 1,417 Wendy’s restaurants. Accordingly,  we are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate. In particular, the value of our real property assets could decrease, and costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends, supply or demand for the use of the restaurants, which may result from competition from similar restaurants in the area, and liability for environmental matters.16Wendy’s is subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances. These environmental laws provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner, operator or occupant of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. Third parties may also make claims against owners, operators or occupants of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such substances.  A number of our restaurant sites were formerly gas stations or are adjacent to current or former gas stations, or were used for other commercial activities that can create environmental impacts. We may also acquire or lease these types of sites in the future. We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of all of our properties. We may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our leased and owned properties, and any such liabilities identified in the future could cause us to incur significant costs, including costs associated with litigation, fines or clean-up responsibilities.  In addition, we cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted.  We cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with any environmental laws or regulations or to satisfy any such claims.  See “Item 1. Business - General - Environmental and Other Matters.” Wendy’s leases real property generally for initial terms of 20 years with two to four additional options to extend the term of the leases in consecutive five-year increments. Many leases provide that the landlord may increase the rent over the term of the lease and any renewals thereof. Most leases require us to pay all of the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. We generally cannot cancel these leases. If an existing or future restaurant is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each lease expires, we may fail to negotiate additional renewals or renewal options, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations.Due to the concentration of Wendy’s restaurants in particular geographic regions, our business results could be impacted by the adverse economic conditions prevailing in those regions regardless of the state of the national economy as a whole.As of January 1, 2012, we and our franchisees operated Wendy’s restaurants in 50 states, the District of Columbia and 27 foreign countries and territories.  As of January 1, 2012 as detailed in “Item 2. Properties,” the 8 leading states by number of operating units were: Florida, Ohio, Texas, Georgia, Michigan, California, Pennsylvania and North Carolina.  This geographic concentration can cause economic conditions in particular areas of the country to have a disproportionate impact on our overall results of operations.  It is possible that adverse economic conditions in states or regions that contain a high concentration of Wendy’s restaurants could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the future.Our operations are influenced by adverse weather conditions.Weather, which is unpredictable, can impact Wendy’s restaurant sales.  Harsh weather conditions that keep customers from dining out result in lost opportunities for our restaurants.  A heavy snowstorm in the Northeast or Midwest or a hurricane in the Southeast can shut down an entire metropolitan area, resulting in a reduction in sales in that area.  Our first quarter includes winter months and historically has a lower level of sales at company-owned restaurants.  Because a significant portion of our restaurant operating costs is fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of sales during these periods hurts our operating margins, and can result in restaurant operating losses.  For these reasons, a quarter-to-quarter comparison may not be a good indication of Wendy’s performance or how it may perform in the future.Wendy’s business could be hurt by increased labor costs or labor shortages.Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our company-owned restaurants.  Wendy’s devotes significant resources to recruiting and training its managers and hourly employees.  Increased labor costs due to competition, increased minimum wage or employee benefits costs (including government-mandated health care benefits) or other factors would adversely impact our cost of sales and operating expenses.  In addition, Wendy’s success depends on its ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and staff.  If the brand is unable to do so, our results of operations could be adversely affected.17Wendy’s plans to expand its breakfast initiative.  The breakfast daypart remains competitive and markets may prove difficult to penetrate.  The breakfast initiative at Wendy’s has been accompanied by challenging competitive conditions, varied consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns that differ from lunch, snack, dinner and late night hours.  In addition, breakfast sales can cannibalize sales during other parts of the day and may have negative impacts on food and labor costs, advertising, and restaurant margins. Wendy’s plans to expand its breakfast initiative. Capital investments will be required at company-owned restaurants that are added to the breakfast initiative, and franchisees will be required to make capital investments in their restaurants that participate in the breakfast initiative.  In addition, Wendy’s expects to incur additional advertising expense to encourage customers to purchase breakfast at Wendy’s.  As a result of all of these factors, breakfast sales and resulting profits may take longer than expected to reach targeted levels and the expansion of the breakfast initiative may be slower than planned. Complaints or litigation may hurt the Wendy’s brand.Wendy’s customers file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to a Wendy’s restaurant, or alleging that there was a problem with food quality or operations at a Wendy’s restaurant.  We are also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims from franchisees (which tend to increase when franchisees experience declining sales and profitability) and claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, including class action lawsuits related to these matters.  Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management’s attention away from operations and hurt our performance.  We cannot estimate the aggregate possible range of loss due to most proceedings being in preliminary stages, with various motions either yet to be submitted or pending, discovery yet to occur, and significant factual matters unresolved.  In addition, most cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages and many involve multiple parties.  Predicting the outcomes of settlement discussions or judicial or arbitral decisions are thus inherently difficult. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.  Further, adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt us and our franchisees.  Additionally, the restaurant industry has been subject to a number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of certain of their customers.  Adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may harm the reputation of our restaurants, even if the allegations are not directed against our restaurants or are not valid, and even if we are not found liable or the concerns relate only to a single restaurant or a limited number of restaurants.  Moreover, complaints, litigation or adverse publicity experienced by one or more of Wendy’s franchisees could also hurt our business as a whole.We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of the Wendy’s brand and hurt our business.Our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business.  We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and other intellectual property.  The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both existing and new markets. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property, either in print or on the Internet, the value of our brand may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the failure of our brand to achieve and maintain market acceptance.  This could harm our image, brand or competitive position and, if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, cause us to incur significant legal fees.We franchise our brand to various franchisees.  While we try to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by all of our franchisees, we cannot assure you that these franchisees will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property or the reputation of the Wendy’s restaurant system.  We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions.  The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the United States in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries.  We cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate.  The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.   18In addition, we cannot assure you that third parties will not claim infringement by us in the future.  Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause delays in introducing new menu items, require costly modifications to advertising and promotional materials or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.  As a result, any such claim could harm our business and cause a decline in our results of operations and financial condition.Our current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims that may be filed.We currently maintain insurance we believe is adequate for businesses of our size and type.  However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters or acts of terrorism.  In addition, we currently self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under workers compensation, general liability and property insurance programs.  Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs, which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Changes in legal or regulatory requirements, including franchising laws, accounting standards, payment card industry rules, overtime rules, minimum wage rates, government-mandated health care benefits, tax legislation and menu-board labeling requirements, may hurt our ability to open new restaurants or otherwise hurt our existing and future operations and results.Each Wendy’s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, safety and other agencies in the state and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located, as well as to Federal laws, rules and regulations and requirements of non-governmental entities such as payment card industry rules. State and local government authorities may enact laws, rules or regulations that impact restaurant operations and the cost of conducting those operations.  For example, recent efforts to require the listing of specified nutritional information on menus and menu boards could adversely affect consumer demand for our products, could make our menu boards less appealing and could increase our costs of doing business.  There can be no assurance that we and/or our franchisees will not experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants, which could delay the opening of such restaurants in the future.  In addition, more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to tax, zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.  Federal laws, rules and regulations address many aspects of our business, such as franchising, minimum wages and taxes. We and our franchisees are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, along with the ADA, family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted by the states that govern these and other employment law matters.  Federal legislation regarding changes in government-mandated health care benefits is also anticipated to increase our costs and the costs of our franchisees and may result in significant modifications to our employment and hiring practices.  Because of the absence of implementing regulations, we currently cannot predict the timing or amount of those cost increases or modifications to our business practices.  However, the cost increases may be material and such modifications to our business practices may be disruptive to our operations and impact our ability to attract and retain personnel.Wendy’s does not exercise ultimate control over purchasing for its restaurant system, which could harm sales or profitability and the brand.Although Wendy’s  ensures that all suppliers to the Wendy’s system meet quality control standards, Wendy’s franchisees control the purchasing of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies from such suppliers through the purchasing co-op controlled by Wendy’s franchisees, QSCC.  QSCC negotiates national contracts for such food, equipment and supplies.  Wendy’s is entitled to appoint two representatives (of the total of 11) on the board of directors of QSCC and participates in QSCC through its company-owned restaurants, but does not control the decisions and activities of QSCC except to ensure that all suppliers satisfy Wendy’s quality control standards.  If QSCC does not properly estimate the product needs of the Wendy’s  system, makes poor purchasing decisions, or decides to cease its operations, system sales and operating costs could be adversely affected and our results of operations and financial condition or the financial condition of Wendy’s franchisees could be hurt. 19Our international operations are subject to various factors of uncertainty and there is no assurance that international operations will be profitable. In addition to many of the risk factors described throughout this Item 1A, Wendy’s business outside of the United States is subject to a number of additional factors, including international economic and political conditions, risk of corruption and violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws of other countries, differing cultures and consumer preferences, the inability to adapt to international customer preferences, inadequate brand infrastructure within foreign countries to support our international activities, inability to obtain adequate supplies meeting our quality standards and product specifications or interruptions in obtaining such supplies, currency regulations and fluctuations, diverse government regulations and tax systems, uncertain or differing interpretations of rights and obligations in connection with international franchise agreements and the collection of royalties from international franchisees, the availability and cost of land, construction costs, other legal, financial or regulatory impediments to the development and/or operation of new restaurants, and the availability of experienced management, appropriate franchisees, and joint venture partners. Although we believe we have developed the support structure required for international growth, there is no assurance that such growth will occur or that international operations will be profitable. We rely on computer systems and information technology to run our business.  Any material failure, interruption or security breach of our computer systems or information technology may result in adverse publicity and adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations. We are significantly dependent upon our computer systems and information technology to properly conduct our business. A failure or interruption of computer systems or information technology could result in the loss of data, business interruptions or delays in business operations. Also, despite our considerable efforts and technological resources to secure our computer systems and information technology, security breaches, such as unauthorized access and computer viruses, may occur resulting in system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  A significant security breach of our computer systems or information technology could require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, and incur penalties or other costs that could adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations. Failure to comply with laws, regulations and third-party contracts regarding the collection, maintenance and processing of information may result in adverse publicity and adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations. We collect, maintain and process certain information about customers and employees.  Our use and protection of this information is regulated by various laws and regulations, as well as by third-party contracts.  If our systems or employees fail to comply with these laws, regulations or contract terms, it could require us to notify customers, employees or other groups, result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, increase fees payable to third parties, and incur penalties or remediation and other costs that could adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations. We may be required to recognize additional asset impairment and other asset-related charges.We have significant amounts of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets and have incurred impairment charges in the past with respect to those assets. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we test for impairment generally annually, or more frequently, if there are indicators of impairment, such as:•significant adverse changes in the business climate;•current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with long-lived assets; •a current expectation that more-likely-than-not (e.g., a likelihood that is more than 50%) long-lived assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life; and•a significant drop in our stock price.Based upon future economic and capital market conditions, as well as the operating performance of our reporting units, future impairment charges could be incurred.20Wendy’s Restaurants and its subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions, and substantially all of their non-real estate assets are pledged and subject to certain restrictions, under a Credit Agreement.  In May 2010, Wendy’s Restaurants entered into a $650.0 million Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which includes a $500.0 million senior secured term loan facility and a $150.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility.  The obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the non-real estate assets of Wendy’s Restaurants and its domestic subsidiaries (other than certain unrestricted subsidiaries), the stock of its domestic subsidiaries (other than certain unrestricted subsidiaries), 65% of the stock of certain of its foreign subsidiaries, as well as by mortgages on certain restaurant properties.  The affirmative and negative covenants in the Credit Agreement include, among others, preservation of corporate existence; payment of taxes; and maintenance of insurance; and limitations on: indebtedness (including guarantee obligations of other indebtedness); liens; mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions; sales of assets; dividends and other payments in respect of capital stock; investments; payments of certain indebtedness; transactions with affiliates; changes in fiscal year; negative pledge clauses and clauses restricting subsidiary distributions; and material changes in lines of business.  The financial covenants contained in the Credit Agreement are (i) a consolidated interest coverage ratio, (ii) a consolidated senior secured leverage ratio and (iii) a consolidated senior secured lease adjusted leverage ratio. The covenants generally do not restrict The Wendy’s Company or any of its subsidiaries that are not subsidiaries of Wendy’s Restaurants.  If the Borrowers are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain the funds necessary to make required payments of interest or principal under, or are unable to comply with covenants of, the Credit Agreement, then they would be in default under the terms of the agreement, which would preclude the payment of dividends to The Wendy’s Company, restrict access to the revolving credit facility, and, under certain circumstances, permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness.  See Note 12 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in Item 8 herein, for further information regarding the Credit Agreement. Wendy’s Restaurants and its subsidiaries have a significant amount of debt outstanding. Such indebtedness, along with the other contractual commitments of our subsidiaries, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to meet payment obligations under the Wendy’s Restaurants 10.0% Senior Notes due in 2016 (the “Senior Notes”) and other debt.Wendy’s Restaurants and certain of its subsidiaries have a significant amount of debt and debt service requirements. As of January 1, 2012, on a consolidated basis, there was approximately $1.3 billion of outstanding debt.This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:•making it more difficult to meet payment and other obligations under the Senior Notes and other outstanding debt;•resulting in an event of default if our subsidiaries fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of our subsidiaries’ debt becoming immediately due and payable;•reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;•subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates, including borrowings under the Credit Agreement;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries also have significant contractual requirements for the purchase of soft drinks. Wendy’s has also provided loan guarantees to various lenders on behalf of franchisees entering into pooled debt facility arrangements for new store development and equipment financing. Certain subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have been indemnified. In addition, certain subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have not been indemnified. These commitments could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and the ability of our subsidiaries to meet payment obligations under the Senior Notes and other debt.21The ability to meet payment and other obligations under the debt instruments of our subsidiaries depends on their ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under existing or any future credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable our subsidiaries to meet their payment obligations under the Senior Notes and other debt and to fund other liquidity needs. If our subsidiaries are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations, they may need to refinance or restructure debt, including the Senior Notes, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If our subsidiaries are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, they may not be able to meet payment obligations under the Senior Notes and other debt and other obligations.We and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could exacerbate further the risks associated with our substantial leverage.We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, in the future. The terms of the Senior Notes indenture and the Credit Agreement restrict, but do not completely prohibit, us or our subsidiaries from doing so. In addition, the Senior Notes indenture allows Wendy’s Restaurants to issue additional Senior Notes under certain circumstances, which will also be guaranteed by the guarantors of the Senior Notes. The indenture also allows Wendy’s Restaurants to incur certain secured debt and allows our foreign subsidiaries to incur additional debt, which would be effectively senior to the Senior Notes. In addition, the indenture does not prevent Wendy’s Restaurants from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current consolidated debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.To service debt and meet its other cash needs, Wendy’s Restaurants will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be generated or available to it.The ability of Wendy’s Restaurants to make payments on, or repay or refinance, its debt, including the Senior Notes and the Credit Agreement, and to fund planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend largely upon its future operating performance. Future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, the ability of Wendy’s Restaurants to borrow funds in the future to make payments on its debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in its credit facilities and other debt agreements, including the indenture governing the Senior Notes, the Credit Agreement and other agreements it may enter into in the future. Specifically, Wendy’s Restaurants will need to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests. There is no assurance that the Wendy’s Restaurants business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under its credit facilities or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its debt, including the Senior Notes and Credit Agreement, or to fund its or The Wendy’s Company’s dividend and other liquidity needs.As a result of the indemnification provisions of the Purchase and Sale Agreement pursuant to which the sale of Arby’s occurred on July 4, 2011, Wendy’s Restaurants may incur expenses and liabilities for taxes related to periods up to the date of sale.As a result of the indemnification provisions of the Purchase and Sale Agreement pursuant to which the sale of Arby’s occurred on July 4, 2011, Wendy’s Restaurants may incur expenses and liabilities for taxes related to periods up to the date of sale, such as income, sales and use, and other operating taxes.  Discontinued operations for the 2011 third and fourth quarters included $2.1 million for amounts accrued for certain tax liabilities related to Arby’s which are the obligations of Wendy’s Restaurants pursuant to the indemnification provisions of the Purchase and Sale Agreement and it is possible that further accruals may occur in future periods as audits by various taxing authorities are resolved.  Further accruals in future periods would adversely affect our results of operations.Risks Related to The Wendy’s CompanyThere can be no assurance regarding whether or to what extent The Wendy’s Company will pay dividends on its Common Stock in the future.Holders of The Wendy’s Company Common Stock will only be entitled to receive such dividends as its Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments.  Any dividends will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on The Wendy’s Company’s earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time.22Because The Wendy’s Company is a holding company, its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent upon cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand and cash flows from its subsidiaries.  The ability of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends and/or make loans or advances to the holding company will be dependent upon their respective abilities to achieve sufficient cash flows after satisfying their respective cash requirements, including subsidiary-level debt service and revolving credit agreements, to enable the payment of such dividends or the making of such loans or advances. The ability of any of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or other payments to The Wendy’s Company will also be limited by restrictions in debt instruments currently existing or subsequently entered into by such subsidiaries, including the Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes indenture, which are described earlier in this Item 1A.A substantial amount of The Wendy’s Company Common Stock is concentrated in the hands of certain stockholders.Nelson Peltz, The Wendy’s Company Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, and Peter May, The Wendy’s Company Vice Chairman and former President and Chief Operating Officer, beneficially own shares of The Wendy’s Company outstanding Common Stock that collectively constitute more than 25% of its total voting power.  Messrs. Peltz and May may, from time to time, acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of Common Stock.  On December 1, 2011, The Wendy’s Company entered into an agreement (the “Trian Agreement”) with Messrs. Peltz and May and several of their affiliates (the “Covered Persons”).  Pursuant to the Trian Agreement, the Board of Directors (the “Board”), including a majority of the independent directors, approved, for purposes of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“Section 203”), the Covered Persons becoming the owners (as defined in Section 203(c)(9) of the DGCL) of or acquiring an aggregate of up to (and including), but not more than, 32.5% (subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Agreement, the “Maximum Percentage”) of the outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock, such that no such persons would be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 203 solely as a result of such ownership (such approval, the “Section 203 Approval”). Pursuant to the 2011 Agreement, each of the Covered Persons has agreed that, for so long as the Company has a class of equity securities listed on any national securities exchange, (a) he will not purchase or cause to be purchased, or otherwise acquire, beneficial ownership of Company voting securities that would increase the aggregate beneficial ownership of Company voting securities by the Covered Persons above the Maximum Percentage; (b) he will not solicit proxies or submit any proposal for the vote of stockholders of the Company or recommend or request or induce any other person to take any such actions or seek to advise, encourage or influence any other person with respect to the Shares, in each case, if the result of such action would be to cause the Board to be comprised of less than a majority of independent directors; (c) he will not engage in certain affiliate transactions with the Company without the prior approval of a majority of the Audit Committee of the Board or other committee of the Board that is comprised of independent directors; and (iii) except with respect to certain pledged shares, each of the Covered Persons shall cause the Company voting securities owned by it to be present at stockholder meetings for the purposes of establishing a quorum and shall vote any Company voting securities in excess of the shares beneficially owned by them on the date of the Trian Agreement either as recommended by the Board or in the same proportion as Company voting securities not owned by the Covered Persons are actually voted, subject to certain limited exceptions.The Trian Agreement (other than the provisions relating to the Section 203 Approval and certain miscellaneous provisions that survive the termination of the Agreement) will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the Covered Persons ceasing to own in the aggregate 25% of the outstanding voting power of the Company, (ii) December 1, 2014, (iii) at such time as the Company's Common Stock is no longer listed on a national securities exchange, and (iv) such time as any person other than the Covered Persons or any Affiliate, Associate of, or member of a Schedule 13D group with, the Covered Persons, (a) makes an offer to purchase (x) an amount of shares that when added to the number of shares already beneficially owned by such person and its affiliates and associates equals or exceeds 50% of the outstanding voting power of the Company or (y) all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, (b) solicits proxies with respect to a majority slate of directors or (c) commences or announces an intention to commence a solicitation of proxies, becomes a “participant” in a “solicitation” or assists any “participant” in, a “solicitation” as such terms are defined in Rule 14a-1 of Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), or submits any proposal for the vote of stockholders of the Company, or recommends or requests or induces or attempts to induce any other person to take any such actions, or to seek to advise, encourage or influence any other person with respect to the voting of Company voting securities, in each case, if the result of any such proposal or solicitation would be to change a majority of the persons serving as directors on the Board.23This concentration of ownership gives Messrs. Peltz and May significant influence over the outcome of actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets.  They are also in a position to have significant influence to prevent or cause a change in control of The Wendy’s Company.  If in the future Messrs. Peltz and May were to acquire more than a majority of The Wendy’s Company outstanding voting power, they would be able to determine the outcome of the election of members of the Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring majority stockholder approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of The Wendy’s Company assets.  They would also be in a position to prevent or cause a change in control of The Wendy’s Company.The Wendy’s Company’s certificate of incorporation contains certain anti-takeover provisions and permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and limits its ability to raise capital from affiliates.Certain provisions in The Wendy’s Company’s certificate of incorporation are intended to discourage or delay a hostile takeover of control of The Wendy’s Company.  The Wendy’s Company’s certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of “blank check” preferred stock, which will have such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by its Board of Directors.  Accordingly, its Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of its common stock.  The preferred stock could be used to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of The Wendy’s Company that is determined by its Board of Directors to be undesirable.  Although The Wendy’s Company has no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock, it cannot assure you that it will not do so in the future.The Wendy’s Company’s certificate of incorporation prohibits the issuance of preferred stock to affiliates, unless offered ratably to the holders of The Wendy’s Company’s common stock, subject to an exception in the event that The Wendy’s Company is in financial distress and the issuance is approved by its audit committee.  This prohibition limits the ability to raise capital from affiliates.Risks Related to Wendy’s RestaurantsWendy’s Restaurants is dependent on dividends and/or loans or advances from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service obligations.  The ability of Wendy’s Restaurants’ subsidiaries to pay cash dividends and/or make loans or advances to Wendy’s Restaurants will be dependent upon their respective abilities to achieve sufficient cash flows after satisfying their respective cash requirements, including subsidiary-level debt service and revolving credit agreements, to enable the payment of such dividends or the making of such loans or advances. The ability of any of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or other payments to  Wendy’s Restaurants will also be limited by restrictions in debt instruments currently existing or subsequently entered into by such subsidiaries, including the Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes indenture, which are described above in this Item 1A"
2,WEN,WENDY'S CO,2011-03-03,"  Risk Factors
.We wish to caution readers that in addition to the important factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we have included below the most significant factors that have affected, or in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results during 2011, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.Risks Related to Wendy’s/Arby’s and Wendy’s/Arby’s RestaurantsThe impact and results of our announcement that Wendy’s/Arby’s is exploring strategic alternatives for the Arby’s brand, including a sale of the brand, are uncertain and cannot be determined.In January 2011, Wendy’s/Arby’s announced that it is exploring strategic alternatives for the Arby’s brand, including a sale of the brand.  There can be no assurance that the review of strategic alternatives will result in any agreement or transaction, or that if an agreement is executed, that a transaction will be consummated. We do not intend to disclose developments with respect to this review (whether or not material) unless and until the Board of Directors has approved a specific course of action or terminated the exploration of strategic alternatives. In connection with our exploration of strategic alternatives, we expect to incur expenses, including expenses in connection with the retention of key personnel and consultants.  The process of exploring strategic alternatives may be disruptive to our business. The inability to effectively manage the process and any resulting agreement or transaction could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our success depends in part upon the continued retention of certain key personnel.We believe that over time our success has been dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management team.  The failure by us to retain members of our senior management team could adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts we have undertaken to increase the efficiency and profitability of our businesses.  The retention of members of our senior management team may be more difficult following Wendy’s/Arby’s announcement that it is exploring strategic alternatives for the Arby’s brand, including the sale of the brand.Growth of our restaurant businesses is significantly dependent on new restaurant openings, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.Our restaurant businesses derive earnings from sales at company-owned restaurants, franchise royalties received from franchised restaurants and franchise fees from franchise restaurant operators for each new unit opened.  Growth in our restaurant revenues and earnings is significantly dependent on new restaurant openings.  Numerous factors beyond our control may affect restaurant openings.  These factors include but are not limited to:  ·our ability to attract new franchisees;  ·the availability of site locations for new restaurants;  ·the ability of potential restaurant owners to obtain financing;  ·the ability of restaurant owners to hire, train and retain qualified operating personnel;  ·construction and development costs of new restaurants, particularly in highly-competitive markets;  ·the ability of restaurant owners to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all; and  ·adverse weather conditions.Wendy’s and Arby’s franchisees could take actions that could harm our business.Wendy’s and Arby’s franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with the standards set forth in agreements with them.  Each brand also provides training and support to franchisees.  However, franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and the franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants.  As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee.  If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with required standards, royalty payments to us will be adversely affected and the brand’s image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.  14  Our success depends on franchisees’ participation in brand strategies.Wendy’s and Arby’s franchisees are an integral part of our business.  Each brand may be unable to successfully implement  brand strategies that it believes are necessary for further growth if franchisees do not participate in that implementation.  Our business and operating results could be adversely affected if a significant number of franchisees do not participate in brand strategies.Our financial results are affected by the operating results of franchisees.As of January 2, 2011, approximately 79% of the Wendy’s system and 69% of the Arby’s system were franchise restaurants.  We receive revenue in the form of royalties, which are generally based on a percentage of sales at franchised restaurants, rent and fees from franchisees.  Accordingly, a substantial portion of our financial results is to a large extent dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees.  If sales trends or economic conditions worsen for franchisees, their financial results may worsen and our royalty, rent and other fee revenues may decline.  In addition, accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts may increase.  When company-owned restaurants are sold, one of our subsidiaries is often required to remain responsible for lease payments for these restaurants to the extent that the purchasing franchisees default on their leases.  During periods of declining sales and profitability of franchisees, such as have been recently experienced by a significant number of Arby’s franchisees and a minimal number of Wendy’s franchisees, the incidence of franchisee defaults for these lease payments increases and we are then required to make those payments and seek recourse against the franchisee or agree to repayment terms.  Additionally, if franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements, or if we decide to restructure franchise agreements in order to induce franchisees to renew these agreements, then our royalty revenues may decrease.  Further, we may decide from time to time to acquire restaurants from franchisees that experience significant financial hardship, which may reduce our cash and equivalents.As of January 2, 2011, there were approximately 350 Arby’s franchised restaurants with amounts payable to Arby’s for royalties, rent and/or other fees that were at least 60 days past due.  The financial condition of a number of Arby’s franchisees was one of the factors that resulted in a net decrease of 44 and 31 in the number of franchised restaurants for fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively.  During those periods 96 and 74 franchised Arby’s restaurants were closed, respectively.  The trend of declining sales at franchised Arby’s restaurants has resulted in decreases in royalties and other franchise revenues. In addition, Arby’s franchisee accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts have increased significantly, and may continue to grow as a result of the deteriorating financial condition of some of our franchisees. Franchisees’ financial difficulties and the closure of franchised restaurants have also caused reductions in the contributions to and extent of advertising programs.  Continuation of these trends would affect our revenues and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.In December 2009, and as amended in February and August 2010, AFA entered into a revolving loan agreement with Arby’s.  The terms of this agreement allow AFA to have revolving loans of up to $14.0 million outstanding with an expiration date of March 2012 and bearing interest at 7.5% per annum.   In February 2011, the maximum principal amount was reduced to $11.0 million.  As of January 2, 2011, the outstanding balance under this agreement was $4.5 million and there were no amounts past due.  Due to declining sales and profitability of Arby’s franchisees, it is possible that our ability in the future to collect principal and interest payments from AFA could be adversely affected.Each brand may be unable to manage effectively the acquisition and disposition of restaurants, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.Each brand acquires restaurants from franchisees and in some cases “re-franchises” these restaurants by selling them to new or existing franchisees.  The success of these transactions is dependent upon the availability of sellers and buyers, the availability of financing, and the brand’s ability to negotiate transactions on terms deemed acceptable.  In addition, the operations of restaurants that each brand acquires may not be integrated successfully, and the intended benefits of such transactions may not be realized.  Acquisitions of franchised restaurants pose various risks to brand operations, including:  ·diversion of management attention to the integration of acquired restaurant operations;  ·increased operating expenses and the inability to achieve expected cost savings and operating efficiencies;  ·exposure to liabilities arising out of sellers’ prior operations of acquired restaurants; and  ·incurrence or assumption of debt to finance acquisitions or improvements and/or the assumption of long-term, non-cancelable leases. In addition, engaging in acquisitions and dispositions places increased demands on the brand’s operational and financial management resources and may require us to continue to expand these resources.  If either brand is unable to manage the acquisition and disposition of restaurants effectively, its business and financial results could be adversely affected.Arby’s does not exercise ultimate control over advertising for its restaurant system, which could harm sales and the brand. Arby’s franchisees control the provision of national advertising and marketing services to the Arby’s  franchise system through AFA, a company controlled by Arby’s franchisees.  Subject to Arby’s right to protect its trademarks, AFA has the right to approve all significant decisions regarding national marketing and advertising strategies and the creative content of advertising for the Arby’s system.  Although Arby’s has entered into a management agreement pursuant to which Arby’s, on behalf of AFA, manages the day-to-day operations of the AFA, many areas are still subject to ultimate approval by AFA’s independent board of directors, and the   15   management agreement may be terminated for any reason by Arby’s upon one year’s prior notice or by AFA upon six months prior notice.  See “Item 1. Business—The Arby’s Restaurant System—Advertising and Marketing.”  In addition, local cooperatives run by operators of Arby’s restaurants in a particular local area (including Arby’s) make their own decisions regarding local advertising expenditures, subject to the requirement to spend at least the specified minimum amounts.  Arby’s lack of control over advertising could hurt sales and the Arby’s brand.Neither Wendy’s nor Arby’s exercises ultimate control over purchasing for their respective restaurant system, which could harm sales or profitability and the brand.Although Wendy’s and Arby’s ensure that all suppliers to their respective systems meet quality control standards, each brand’s franchisees control the purchasing of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies from such suppliers through purchasing co-ops controlled by each brand’s franchisees.  The co-ops negotiate national contracts for such food, equipment and supplies.  Wendy’s is entitled to appoint two representatives on the board of directors of QSCC and participates in QSCC through its company-owned restaurants, but otherwise does not control the decisions and activities of QSCC except to ensure that all suppliers satisfy Wendy’s quality control standards.  Arby’s is entitled to appoint one representative on the board of directors of ARCOP and participates in ARCOP through its company-owned restaurants, but otherwise does not control the decisions and activities of ARCOP except to ensure that all suppliers satisfy Arby’s quality control standards.  During the 2010 second quarter, QSCC and ARCOP, in consultation with Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants, established SSG to manage and operate purchasing programs which combine the purchasing power of both Wendy’s and Arby’s company-owned and franchised restaurants to create buying efficiencies for certain non-perishable goods, equipment and services.  If any of these co-ops does not properly estimate the product needs of its respective system, makes poor purchasing decisions, or decides to cease its operations, system sales and operating costs could be adversely affected and the financial condition of Wendy’s or Arby’s or the financial condition of each system’s franchisees could be hurt.Should a sale of Arby’s occur as discussed in “Business - The Arby’s Restaurant System” in Item 1 herein, under the change of control provisions in the agreement that established SSG, the activities of SSG would be wound up.  In the wind up process, the assets, personnel and functions of SSG would be transferred to QSCC and ARCOP as such parties and Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants agree.  In contemplation of a possible sale, the parties are in discussion regarding the dissolution of SSG and transferring SSG’s assets, personnel and functions to QSCC and ARCOP.  The dissolution of SSG could be disruptive to our business and the operations of QSCC and ARCOP, result in the loss of experienced personnel and adversely affect the financial condition of Wendy’s or Arby8217;s or the financial condition of each system’s franchisees.Shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of perishable food products could damage the Wendy’s and/or Arby's brand reputation and adversely affect our operating results. Each brand and its franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet brand specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, disease or food-borne illnesses, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which could lower our revenues, increase operating costs, damage brand reputation and otherwise harm our business and the businesses of our franchisees.Food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. Coli) involving Wendy’s or Arby’s or their respective supply chains, could create negative publicity and adversely affect sales at either or both brands.Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe, quality food products. However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. Coli), have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future. Food safety events could adversely affect the price and availability of beef, poultry or other meats. As a result, Wendy’s and/or Arby’s restaurants could experience a significant increase in food costs if there are food safety events whether or not such events involve Wendy’s or Arby’s restaurants or restaurants of competitors.In addition, food safety events, whether or not involving Wendy’s or Arby’s, could result in negative publicity for Wendy’s and/or Arby’s or for the industry or market segments in which we operate.  This negative publicity, as well as any other negative publicity concerning types of food products Wendy’s or Arby’s serves, may reduce demand for Wendy’s and/or Arby’s food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to other products or food types.  A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could result in a decline in sales at company-owned restaurants or in royalties from sales at franchised restaurants. Consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of beef, poultry, French fries or other products we sell or concerns regarding the effects of disease outbreaks such as “mad cow disease” and avian influenza or “bird flu,” could affect demand for our products.Consumer concerns regarding the nutritional aspects of beef, poultry, French fries or other products we sell or concerns regarding the effects of disease outbreaks such as “mad cow disease” and avian influenza or “bird flu,” could result in less demand for our products and a decline in sales at company-owned restaurants and in the royalties that we receive from franchisees.  16   Changes in consumer tastes and preferences, and in discretionary consumer spending, could result in a decline in sales at company-owned restaurants and in the royalties that we receive from franchisees.The quick service restaurant industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions, discretionary spending priorities, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants. Our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income.  Accordingly, we may experience declines in sales during economic downturns.  Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending or a decline in consumer food-away-from-home spending could hurt our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.If company-owned and franchised restaurants are unable to adapt to changes in consumer preferences and trends, company-owned and franchised restaurants may lose customers and the resulting revenues from company-owned restaurants and the royalties that we receive from franchisees may decline.The disruptions in the national and global economies and the financial markets may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.The disruptions in the national and global economies and financial markets, and the related reductions in the availability of credit, have resulted in high unemployment rates and declines in consumer confidence and spending, and have made it more difficult for businesses to obtain financing.  If such conditions persist, then they may result in significant declines in consumer food-away-from-home spending and customer traffic in our restaurants and those of our franchisees.  Such conditions may also adversely impact the ability of franchisees to build or purchase restaurants, remodel existing restaurants, renew expiring franchise agreements and make timely royalty and other payments.  There can be no assurance that government responses to the disruptions in the financial markets will restore consumer confidence, stabilize the markets or increase liquidity and the availability of credit.  If we or our franchisees are unable to obtain borrowed funds on acceptable terms, or if conditions in the economy and the financial markets do not improve, our revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition could be adversely affected.Additionally, we have entered into interest rate swaps and other derivative contracts as described in Note 12 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in Item 8 herein, and we may enter into additional swaps in the future.  We are exposed to potential losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on these instruments, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Changes in commodity costs (including beef and chicken), supply, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs could harm results of operations.Our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs (including beef and chicken), supply, fuel, distribution and other operating costs.  Any increase in these costs, especially beef or chicken prices, could harm operating results.  In addition, each brand is susceptible to increases in these costs as a result of other factors beyond its control, such as weather conditions, global demand, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulations.  Additionally, prices for feed ingredients used to produce beef and chicken could be adversely affected by changes in global weather patterns, which are inherently unpredictable.  Increases in gasoline prices would result in the imposition of fuel surcharges by our distributors, which would increase our costs.  Significant increases in gasoline prices could also result in a decrease in customer traffic at our restaurants, which could adversely affect our business.  We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results.  In addition, we may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to our customers. Competition from other restaurant companies, or poor customer experience at Wendy’s or Arby’s restaurants, could hurt our brands.The market segments in which company-owned and franchised Wendy’s and Arby’s restaurants compete are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, price, food quality and presentation, service, location, convenience, and the nature and condition of the restaurant facility. If customers have a poor experience at a Wendy’s or Arby’s restaurant, whether at a company-owned or franchised restaurant, we may experience a decrease in guest traffic. Further, Wendy’s and Arby’s restaurants compete with a variety of locally-owned restaurants, as well as competitive regional and national chains and franchises.  Several of these chains compete by offering menu items that are targeted at certain consumer groups or dietary trends.  Additionally, many of our competitors have introduced lower cost, value meal menu options.  Our revenues and those of our franchisees may be hurt by this product and price competition.Moreover, new companies, including operators outside the quick service restaurant industry, may enter our market areas and target our customer base.  For example, additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases have come from deli sections and in-store cafes of a number of major grocery store chains, as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets.  Such competitors may have, among other things, lower operating costs, better locations, better facilities, better management, better products, more effective marketing and more efficient operations.  Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing and marketing strategies in the quick service   17  restaurant industry better than we can.  Many of our competitors spend significantly more on advertising and marketing than we do, which may give them a competitive advantage through higher levels of brand awareness among consumers.  All such competition may adversely affect our revenues and profits by reducing revenues of company-owned restaurants and royalty payments from franchised restaurants.Current restaurant locations may become unattractive, and attractive new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all. The success of any restaurant depends in substantial part on its location. There can be no assurance that our current restaurant locations will continue to be attractive as demographic patterns change. Neighborhood or economic conditions where our restaurants are located could decline in the future, thus resulting in potentially reduced sales in those locations. In addition, rising real estate prices in some areas may restrict our ability and the ability of franchisees to purchase or lease new desirable locations. If desirable locations cannot be obtained at reasonable prices, each brand’s ability to execute its growth strategies will be adversely affected. Wendy’s and Arby’s business could be hurt by increased labor costs or labor shortages.Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our company-owned restaurants.  Each brand devotes significant resources to recruiting and training its managers and hourly employees.  Increased labor costs due to competition, increased minimum wage or employee benefits costs (including government-mandated health care benefits) or other factors would adversely impact our cost of sales and operating expenses.  In addition, each brand’s success depends on its ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and staff.  If either brand is unable to do so, our results of operations could be adversely affected.Each brand’s leasing and ownership of significant amounts of real estate exposes it to possible liabilities and losses, including liabilities associated with environmental matters. As of January 2, 2011, Wendy’s leased or owned the land and/or the building for 1,394 Wendy’s restaurants and Arby’s leased or owned the land and/or the building for 1,144 Arby’s restaurants. Accordingly, each brand is subject to all of the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate. In particular, the value of our real property assets could decrease, and costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends, supply or demand for the use of the restaurants, which may result from competition from similar restaurants in the area, and liability for environmental matters.Each brand is subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances. These environmental laws provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner, operator or occupant of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. Third parties may also make claims against owners, operators or occupants of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such substances.  A number of our restaurant sites were formerly gas stations or are adjacent to current or former gas stations, or were used for other commercial activities that can create environmental impacts. We may also acquire or lease these types of sites in the future. We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of all of our properties. We may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our leased and owned properties, and any such liabilities identified in the future could cause us to incur significant costs, including costs associated with litigation, fines or clean-up responsibilities.  In addition, we cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted.  We cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with any environmental laws or regulations or to satisfy any such claims.  See “Item 1. Business-General-Environmental Matters.” Each brand leases real property generally for initial terms of 20 years with two to four additional options to extend the term of the leases in consecutive five-year increments. Many leases provide that the landlord may increase the rent over the term of the lease and any renewals thereof. Most leases require us to pay all of the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. We generally cannot cancel these leases. If an existing or future restaurant is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each lease expires, we may fail to negotiate additional renewals or renewal options, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations.Complaints or litigation may hurt each brand.Wendy’s and Arby’s customers file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to a Wendy’s or Arby’s restaurant, or alleging that there was a problem with food quality or operations at a Wendy’s or Arby’s restaurant.  We are also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims from franchisees (which tend to increase when franchisees experience declining sales and profitability) and claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, including class action lawsuits related to these matters.  Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management’s attention away from operations and hurt our performance.  A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely   18   affect our financial condition or results of operations.  Further, adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt us and our franchisees.Additionally, the restaurant industry has been subject to a number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of certain of their customers.  Adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may harm the reputation of our restaurants, even if the allegations are not directed against our restaurants or are not valid, and even if we are not found liable or the concerns relate only to a single restaurant or a limited number of restaurants.  Moreover, complaints, litigation or adverse publicity experienced by one or more of Wendy’s or Arby’s franchisees could also hurt our business as a whole.Our current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims that may be filed.We currently maintain insurance we believe is adequate for businesses of our size and type.  However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters or acts of terrorism.  In addition, we currently self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under workers compensation, general liability and property insurance programs.  Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs, which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.</div>Changes in legal or regulatory requirements, including franchising laws, accounting standards, payment card industry rules, overtime rules, minimum wage rates, government-mandated health care benefits, tax legislation and menu-board labeling requirements, may hurt our ability to open new restaurants or otherwise hurt our existing and future operations and results.Each Wendy’s and Arby’s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, safety and other agencies in the state and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located, as well as to Federal laws, rules and regulations and requirements of non-governmental entities such as payment card industry rules. State and local government authorities may enact laws, rules or regulations that impact restaurant operations and the cost of conducting those operations.  For example, recent efforts to require the listing of specified nutritional information on menus and menu boards could adversely affect consumer demand for our products, could make our menu boards less appealing and could increase our costs of doing business.  There can be no assurance that we and/or our franchisees will not experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants, which could delay the opening of such restaurants in the future.  In addition, more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to tax, zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations. Federal laws, rules and regulations address many aspects of our business, such as franchising, minimum wages and taxes. We and our franchisees are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, along with the ADA, family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted by the states that govern these and other employment law matters.  As described more fully under “Item 3. Legal Proceedings,” one of our subsidiaries was a defendant in a lawsuit alleging failure to comply with Title III of the ADA at approximately 775 company-owned restaurants acquired as part of the RTM acquisition by Arby’s in July 2005.  Under a court approved settlement of that lawsuit, Arby’s estimates that it will spend approximately $1.15 million per year of capital expenditures over a seven-year period (which commenced in 2008) to bring these restaurants into compliance with the ADA, in addition to paying certain legal fees and expenses.  We cannot predict the amount of any other future expenditures that may be required in order to permit company-owned restaurants to comply with any changes in existing regulations or to comply with any future regulations that may become applicable to our businesses. Recent Federal legislation regarding changes in government-mandated health care benefits are also anticipated to increase our costs and the costs of our franchisees and may result in significant modifications to our employment and hiring practices.  Because of the absence of implementing regulations, we currently cannot predict the timing or amount of those cost increases or modifications to our business practices.  However, the cost increases may be material and such modifications to our business practices may be disruptive to our operations and impact our ability to attract and retain personnel.Our operations are influenced by adverse weather conditions.Weather, which is unpredictable, can impact Wendy’s and Arby’s restaurant sales.  Harsh weather conditions that keep customers from dining out result in lost opportunities for our restaurants.  A heavy snowstorm in the Northeast or Midwest or a hurricane in the Southeast can shut down an entire metropolitan area, resulting in a reduction in sales in that area.  Our first quarter includes winter months and historically has a lower level of sales at company-owned restaurants.  Because a significant portion of our restaurant operating costs is fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of sales during these periods hurts our operating margins, and can result in restaurant operating losses.  For these reasons, a quarter-to-quarter comparison may not be a good indication of either brand’s performance or how it may perform in the future.  19  Due to the concentration of Wendy’s and Arby’s restaurants in particular geographic regions, our business results could be impacted by the adverse economic conditions prevailing in those regions regardless of the state of the national economy as a whole.As of January 2, 2011, we and our franchisees operated Wendy’s or Arby’s restaurants in 50 states and 24 foreign countries.  As of January 2, 2011 as detailed in “Item 2. Properties,” the 8 leading states by number of operating units were: Ohio, Florida, Texas, Michigan, Georgia, Pennsylvania, California, and North Carolina.  This geographic concentration can cause economic conditions in particular areas of the country to have a disproportionate impact on our overall results of operations.  It is possible that adverse economic conditions in states or regions that contain a high concentration of Wendy’s and Arby’s restaurants could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the future.Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants and its subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions, and substantially all of their non-real estate assets are pledged and subject to certain restrictions, under a Credit Agreement.On May 24, 2010, Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants entered into a $650,000 Credit Agreement which includes a $500,000 senior secured term loan facility and a $150,000 senior secured revolving credit facility.  The obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the non-real estate assets of Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants and its domestic subsidiaries (other than certain unrestricted subsidiaries), the stock of its domestic subsidiaries (other than certain unrestricted subsidiaries), 65% of the stock of certain of its foreign subsidiaries, as well as by mortgages on certain restaurant properties.  The affirmative and negative covenants in the Credit Agreement include, among others, preservation of corporate existence; payment of taxes; and maintenance of insurance; and limitations on: indebtedness (including guarantee obligations of other indebtedness); liens; mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions; sales of assets; dividends and other payments in respect of capital stock; investments; payments of certain indebtedness; transactions with affiliates; changes in fiscal year; negative pledge clauses and clauses restricting subsidiary distributions; and material changes in lines of business.  The financial covenants contained in the Credit Agreement are (i) a consolidated interest coverage ratio, (ii) a consolidated senior secured leverage ratio and (iii) a consolidated senior secured lease adjusted leverage ratio. The covenants generally do not restrict Wendy’s/Arby’s or any of Wendy’s/Arby’s subsidiaries that are not subsidiaries of Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants.  If the Borrowers are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain the funds necessary to make required payments of interest or principal under, or are unable to comply with covenants of, the Credit Agreement, then they would be in default under the terms of the agreement, which would preclude the payment of dividends to Wendy’s/Arby’s, restrict access to the revolving credit facility, and, under certain circumstances, permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness.  See Note 11 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in Item 8 herein, for further information regarding the Credit Agreement.Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants and its subsidiaries have a significant amount of debt outstanding. Such indebtedness, along with the other contractual commitments of our subsidiaries, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to meet payment obligations under the Senior Notes and other debt.Certain of Wendy’s/Arby’s subsidiaries have a significant amount of debt and debt service requirements. As of January 2, 2011, on a consolidated basis, there was approximately $1.6 billion of outstanding debt.This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:  ·making it more difficult to meet payment and other obligations under the Senior Notes and other outstanding debt;  ·resulting in an event of default if our subsidiaries fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of our subsidiaries’ debt becoming immediately due and payable;  ·reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;  ·subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates, including borrowings under the Credit Agreement;  ·limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and  ·placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries also have significant contractual requirements for the purchase of soft drinks. Wendy’s has also provided loan guarantees to various lenders on behalf of franchisees entering into pooled debt facility arrangements for new store development and equipment financing. Certain subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have been indemnified. In addition, certain subsidiaries also guarantee or are contingently liable for certain leases of their respective franchisees for which they have not been indemnified. These commitments could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and the ability of our subsidiaries to meet payment obligations under the Senior Notes and other debt.The ability to meet payment and other obligations under the debt instruments of our subsidiaries depends on their ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under existing or any future credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable our subsidiaries to meet their payment obligations under the Senior Notes and other debt and to fund other   20   liquidity needs. If our subsidiaries are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations, they may need to refinance or restructure debt, including the Senior Notes, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If our subsidiaries are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, they may not be able to meet payment obligations under the Senior Notes and other debt and other obligations.We and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could exacerbate further the risks associated with our substantial leverage.We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, in the future. The terms of the Senior Notes indenture and the Credit Agreement restrict, but do not completely prohibit, us or our subsidiaries from doing so. In addition, the Senior Notes indenture allows Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants to issue additional Senior Notes under certain circumstances, which will also be guaranteed by the guarantors of the Senior Notes. The indenture also allows Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants to incur certain secured debt and allows our foreign subsidiaries to incur additional debt, which would be effectively senior to the Senior Notes. In addition, the indenture does not prevent Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current consolidated debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.To service debt and meet its other cash needs, Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be generated or available to it.The ability of Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants to make payments on, or repay or refinance, its debt, including the Senior Notes and the Credit Agreement, and to fund planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend largely upon its future operating performance. Future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, the ability of Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants to borrow funds in the future to make payments on its debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in its credit facilities and other debt agreements, including the indenture governing the Senior Notes, the Credit Agreement and other agreements it may enter into in the future. Specifically, Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants will need to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests. There is no assurance that the Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under its credit facilities or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its debt, including the Senior Notes and Credit Agreement, or to fund its or Wendy’s/Arby’s dividend and other liquidity needs.We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brands and hurt our business.Our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business.  We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brands and other intellectual property.  The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both existing and new markets. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property, either in print or on the Internet, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the failure of our brands to achieve and maintain market acceptance.  This could harm our image, brand or competitive position and, if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, cause us to incur significant legal fees. We franchise our restaurant brands to various franchisees.  While we try to ensure that the quality of our brands is maintained by all of our franchisees, we cannot assure you that these franchisees will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property or the reputation of the Wendy’s and/or Arby’s restaurant system.We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions.  The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the United States in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries.  We cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate.  The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. In addition, we cannot assure you that third parties will not claim infringement by us in the future.  Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause delays in introducing new menu items, require costly modifications to advertising and promotional materials or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.  As a result, any such claim could harm our business and cause a decline in our results of operations and financial condition. Wendy's plans to expand its new breakfast initiative in 2011.  The breakfast daypart remains competitive and markets may prove difficult to penetrate. The roll out of breakfast at Wendy’s has been accompanied by challenging competitive conditions, varied consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns that differ from lunch, snack, dinner and late night hours. In addition, breakfast sales can cannibalize sales during other parts of the day and may have negative impacts on food and labor costs, advertising, and restaurant margins. Wendy's plans to expand its breakfast initiative in 2011. Capital investments will be required at company-owned restaurants that are   21  added to the breakfast initiative. In addition, franchisees will be required to make capital investments in their restaurants that participate in the breakfast initiative.  As a result of all of these factors, breakfast sales and resulting profits may take longer than expected to reach targeted levels or the planned rollout of breakfast may be delayed or may not occur. Our international operations are subject to various factors of uncertainty and there is no assurance that international operations will be profitable. In addition to many of the risk factors described throughout this Item 1A, each brand’s business outside of the United States is subject to a number of additional factors, including international economic and political conditions, differing cultures and consumer preferences, the inability to adapt to international customer preferences, inadequate brand infrastructure within foreign countries to support our international activities, inability to obtain adequate supplies meeting our quality standards and product specifications or interruptions in obtaining such supplies, currency regulations and fluctuations, diverse government regulations and tax systems, uncertain or differing interpretations of rights and obligations in connection with international franchise agreements and the collection of royalties from international franchisees, the availability and cost of land, construction costs, other legal, financial or regulatory impediments to the development and/or operation of new restaurants, and the availability of experienced management, appropriate franchisees, and joint venture partners. Although we believe we have developed the support structure required for international growth, there is no assurance that such growth will occur or that international operations will be profitable. We rely on computer systems and information technology to run our business. Any material failure, interruption or security breach of our computer systems or information technology may adversely affect the operation of our business and results of operations. We are significantly dependent upon our computer systems and information technology to properly conduct our business. A failure or interruption of computer systems or information technology could result in the loss of data, business interruptions or delays in business operations. Also, despite our considerable efforts and technological resources to secure our computer systems and information technology, security breaches, such as unauthorized access and computer viruses, may occur resulting in system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Any security breach of our computer systems or information technology may result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and profits, penalties, competitive disadvantage, or loss resulting from misappropriation of information.We may be required to recognize additional asset impairment and other asset-related charges.We have significant amounts of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets and have incurred impairment charges in the past with respect to those assets. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we test for impairment generally annually, or more frequently, if there are indicators of impairment, such as:   ·significant adverse changes in the business climate;  ·current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with long-lived assets;  ·a current expectation that more-likely-than-not (e.g., a likelihood that is more than 50%) long-lived assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of their previously estimated useful life; and  ·a significant drop in our stock price.Based upon future economic and capital market conditions, as well as the operating performance of our reporting units, future impairment charges could be incurred.Risks Related to Wendy’s/Arby’sThere can be no assurance regarding whether or to what extent Wendy’s/Arby’s will pay dividends on its Common Stock in the future.Holders of Wendy’s/Arby’s Common Stock will only be entitled to receive such dividends as its Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments.  Any dividends will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on Wendy’s/Arby’s earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and such other factors as the Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time.Because Wendy’s/Arby’s is a holding company, its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent upon cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand and cash flows from its subsidiaries.  The ability of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends and/or make loans or advances to the holding company will be dependent upon their respective abilities to achieve sufficient cash flows after satisfying their respective cash requirements, including subsidiary-level debt service and revolving credit agreements, to enable the payment of such dividends or the making of such loans or advances. The ability of any of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or other payments to Wendy’s/Arby’s will also be limited by restrictions in debt instruments currently existing or subsequently entered into by such subsidiaries, including the Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes indenture, which are described earlier in this Item 1A.  22  A substantial amount of Wendy’s/Arby’s Common Stock is concentrated in the hands of certain stockholders.Nelson Peltz, Wendy’s/Arby’s Chairman and former Chief Executive Officer, and Peter May, Wendy’s/Arby’s Vice Chairman and former President and Chief Operating Officer, beneficially own shares of Wendy’s/Arby’s outstanding Common Stock that collectively constitute approximately 24% of its total voting power.Messrs. Peltz and May may, from time to time, acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of Common Stock.  On November 5, 2008, in connection with the tender offer of Trian Fund Management, L.P. and certain affiliates thereof for up to 40 million shares of our Class A common stock, Wendy’s/Arby’s entered into an agreement (such agreement, as amended, the “Trian Agreement”) with Messrs. Peltz and May and several of their affiliates (the “Covered Persons”) which provides, among other things, that: (i) to the extent the Covered Persons acquire any rights in respect of our common stock so that the effect of such acquisition would increase their aggregate beneficial ownership in Wendy’s/Arby’s common stock to greater than 25%, the Covered Persons may not engage in a business combination (within the meaning of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law ) for a period of three years following the date of such occurrence unless such transaction would be subject to one of the exceptions set forth in Section 203(b)(3) through (7) (assuming for these purposes that 15% in the definition of interested stockholder contained in Section 203 was deemed to be 25%); (ii) for so long as Wendy’s/Arby’s has a class of equity securities that is listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange, none of the Covered Persons shall solicit proxies or submit any proposal for the vote of its stockholders or recommend or request or induce any other person to take any such actions or seek to advise, encourage or influence any other person with respect to Wendy’s/Arby’s common stock, in each case, if the result of such action would be to cause the Board of Directors to be comprised of less than a majority of independent directors; and (iii) for so long as Wendy’s/Arby’s has a class of equity securities that is listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange, none of the Covered Persons shall engage in certain affiliate transactions with Wendy’s/Arby’s without the prior approval of a majority of the Audit Committee or other committee of the Board of Directors that is comprised of independent directors. The Trian Agreement will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the Covered Persons beneficially owning less than 15% of Wendy’s/Arby’s common stock, (ii) November 5, 2011 (with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence), and (iii) at such time as any person not affiliated with the Covered Persons makes an offer to purchase an amount of Wendy’s/Arby’s common stock which when added to Wendy’s/Arby’s common stock already beneficially owned by such person and its affiliates and associates equals or exceeds 50% or more of outstanding Wendy’s/Arby’s common stock or all or substantially all of Wendy’s/Arby’s assets or solicits proxies with respect to a majority slate of directors.This concentration of ownership gives Messrs. Peltz and May significant influence over the outcome of actions requiring stockholder approval.  If in the future Messrs. Peltz and May were to acquire more than a majority of Wendy’s/Arby’s outstanding voting power, they would be able to determine the outcome of the election of members of the Board of Directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring majority stockholder approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of Wendy’s/Arby’s assets.  They would also be in a position to prevent or cause a change in control of Wendy’s/Arby’s. Wendy’s/Arby’s certificate of incorporation contains certain anti-takeover provisions and permits our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and limits its ability to raise capital from affiliates.Certain provisions in Wendy’s/Arby’s certificate of incorporation are intended to discourage or delay a hostile takeover of control of Wendy’s/Arby’s.  Wendy’s/Arby’s certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of “blank check” preferred stock, which will have such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by its Board of Directors.  Accordingly, its Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of its common stock.  The preferred stock could be used to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of Wendy’s/Arby̵7;s that is determined by its Board of Directors to be undesirable.  Although Wendy’s/Arby’s has no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock, it cannot assure you that it will not do so in the future.Wendy’s/Arby’s certificate of incorporation prohibits the issuance of preferred stock to affiliates, unless offered ratably to the holders of Wendy’s/Arby’s common stock, subject to an exception in the event that Wendy’s/Arby’s is in financial distress and the issuance is approved by its audit committee.  This prohibition limits the ability to raise capital from affiliates.Risks Related to Wendy’s/Arby’s RestaurantsWendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants is dependent on dividends and/or loans or advances from its subsidiaries to meet its debt service obligations.The ability of Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants’ subsidiaries to pay cash dividends and/or make loans or advances to Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants will be dependent upon their respective abilities to achieve sufficient cash flows after satisfying their respective cash requirements, including subsidiary-level debt service and revolving credit agreements, to enable the payment of such dividends or the making of such loans or advances. The ability of any of its subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or other payments to  Wendy’s/Arby’s Restaurants will also be limited by restrictions in debt instruments currently existing or subsequently entered into by such subsidiaries, including the Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes indenture, which are described above in this Item 1A.  23 "
7,WEN,WENDY'S CO,2007-03-01,"Risk Factors
.We wish to caution readers that in addition to the important factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the following important factors, among others, sometimes have affected, or in the future could affect, our  actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results during 2007, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.Risks Related to TriarcA substantial amount of our shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock is concentrated in the hands of certain stockholders.As of February 15, 2007, Nelson Peltz, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Peter May, our President and Chief Operating Officer, beneficially owned shares of our outstanding Class A Common Stock  and Class B Common Stock, Series 1, that collectively constituted approximately 36.8% of our Class A Common Stock, 21.5% of our Class B Common Stock and 34.0% of our total voting power.Messrs. Peltz and May may from time to time acquire additional shares of Class A Common Stock, including by exchanging some or all of their shares of Class B Common Stock for shares of Class A Common Stock.  Additionally, we may from time to time repurchase shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock. Such transactions could result in Messrs. Peltz and May together owning more than a majority of our  outstanding voting power. If that were to occur, Messrs. Peltz and May would be able to determine the outcome of the election of members of our board of directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring  majority stockholder approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. They would also be in a position to prevent or cause a change in control of us. In addition, to the  extent we issue additional shares of our Class B Common Stock for acquisitions, financings or compensation purposes, such issuances would not proportionally dilute the voting power of existing stockholders, including  Messrs. Peltz and May.Our success depends substantially upon the continued retention of certain key personnel.We believe that over time our success has been dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our and our subsidiaries senior management teams. The failure by us to retain members of our and/or  our subsidiaries senior management teams could adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts we have undertaken to increase the efficiency and profitability of our businesses. Specifically, in the event a corporate  restructuring is not completed, the loss of Nelson Peltz, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, or Peter May, our President and Chief Operating Officer, or other members of our senior management team could  adversely affect us.We are continuing to explore a possible corporate restructuring that is expected to involve the disposition of our asset management operations, whether through a sale of our ownership interest in Deerfield, a spin-off  of our ownership interest in Deerfield to our stockholders or such other means as our board of directors may conclude would be in the best interests of our stockholders. If the corporate restructuring is completed, it is  currently anticipated that Triarc would be renamed Arbys and would be led by ARGs current Chief Executive Officer, Roland Smith, and the remainder of ARGs management team. Following the corporate  restructuring, although Messrs. Peltz and May will continue to be large stockholders and directors of Arbys, it is currently expected that they and other members of our existing senior management team would no longer  be involved as senior executives of Arbys and the success of the Arbys business would depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of Arbys senior management team. See Item 1. BusinessBusiness  Strategy; Potential Corporate Restructuring.Equity investment funds started by the Principals may create a conflict of interests between the Funds and us.On November 1, 2005, the Principals started the Funds, which are separate and distinct from us and are being managed by the Principals and the Employees through the Management Company. Although the  Principals and the Employees continue to serve as officers and employees of, and receive compensation from, us, we are making the services of the Principals and the Employees available to the Management Company.  Consequently, the Principals and the Employees are no longer providing their services exclusively to us. Triarc14is being reimbursed by the Management Company for the allocable cost of these and other support services being made available to the Management Company. The arrangement by which the Principals and the  Employees provide these services was reviewed and considered by a special committee comprised of independent directors of our board of directors. See Item 1. BusinessBusiness Strategy; Potential Corporate  Restructuring.The investment strategy of the Funds is to achieve capital appreciation by investing in equity securities of publicly traded companies and effecting positive change through active hands-on influence and involvement.  In contrast, Deerfield is an asset manager focusing on fixed income and credit-related strategies with approximately $13.2 billion of assets under management as of December 31, 2006, none of which was invested in  equity securities of publicly traded companies. Although neither the Funds nor Deerfield currently plans to change its investment strategy, a change in investment strategy by either party in the future may create conflicts  of interest between the Funds and us. The Funds have invested and may continue to invest from time to time in companies that compete with Arbys or Deerfield. In addition, while the Principals have agreed to offer us  the opportunity to acquire more than 50% of the outstanding securities of a company in the quick service restaurant segment, if we decline to exercise such opportunity, the Funds could consummate such an acquisition.We  have broad discretion in the use of our cash, cash equivalents and investments.As  of December 31, 2006, we had $327.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, restricted  cash equivalents, investments other than investments held in deferred compensation  trusts and receivables from sales of investments, net of liabilities related  to investments. The foregoing amounts do not reflect regular quarterly cash  dividends of $0.08 per share on our Class A Common Stock and $0.09 per  share on our Class B Common Stock that were declared on February 1, 2007 and  are scheduled to be paid on March 15, 2007 in the aggregate amount of approximately  $8.0 million. We have not otherwise designated any specific use for our cash,  cash equivalents and investment position. In connection with the potential corporate  restructuring, in addition to expected significant severance or contractual  settlement payments, options for our remaining non-restaurant net assets are  under review and could include the allocation of such assets between our businesses  (Arbys and Deerfield) and/or additional special dividends or distributions  to our stockholders.Acquisitions have been a key element of our business strategy, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify appropriate acquisition targets in the future and that we will be able to successfully  integrate any future acquisitions into our existing operations.Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties assimilating new operations and products. In addition, acquisitions may require significant management time and capital resources. We cannot assure you  that we will have access to the capital required to finance potential acquisitions on satisfactory terms, that any acquisition would result in long-term benefits to us or that management would be able to manage effectively  the resulting business. Future acquisitions, if any, are likely to result in the incurrence of additional indebtedness, which could contain restrictive covenants, or the issuance of additional equity securities, which could  dilute our existing stockholders.We cannot assure you that our proposed corporate restructuring will be successfully implemented.We are continuing to explore the feasibility, as well as the risks and opportunities, of a possible corporate restructuring that is expected to involve the disposition of our asset management operations, whether  through a sale of our ownership interest in Deerfield, a spin-off of our ownership interest in Deerfield to our stockholders or such other means as our board of directors may conclude would be in the best interests of our  stockholders. There can be no assurance that the corporate restructuring will occur or the form, terms or timing of such restructuring if it does occur. Our failure to implement these transactions timely and economically  could materially increase our costs and impair our results of operations. Even if the restructuring is completed, there can be no assurance that the expected benefits to Triarc and its stockholders would be realized.15Our investment of excess funds may be subject to risk, particularly due to use of leverage and the riskiness of underlying assets.From time to time we place our excess cash in investment funds managed by third parties (including the Management Company). Some of these funds use substantial leverage in their trading, including through the  use of borrowed funds, total return swaps and/or other derivatives. The use of leverage generates various risks, including the exacerbation of losses, increased interest expense in the case of leverage through borrowing, and  exposure to counterparty risk in the case of leverage through derivatives. However, volatility in the value of a fund is a function not only of the amount of leverage employed but also of the riskiness of the underlying  investments. Therefore, the greater the amount of leverage used by a fund and the greater the riskiness of a funds underlying assets, the greater the risk associated with our investment in such fund.In the future, we may have to take actions that we would not otherwise take so as not to be subject to tax as a personal holding company.If at any time during the last half of our taxable year, five or fewer individuals own or are deemed to own more than 50% of the total value of our shares and if during such taxable year we receive 60% or more of  our gross income, as specially adjusted, from specified passive sources, we would be classified as a personal holding company for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If this were the case, we would be subject to additional  taxes at the rate of 15% on a portion of our income, to the extent this income is not distributed to stockholders. We do not currently expect to have any liability in 2007 for tax under the personal holding company rules.  However, we cannot assure you that we will not become liable for such tax in the future. Because we do not wish to be classified as a personal holding company or to incur any personal holding company tax, we may be  required in the future to take actions that we would not otherwise take. These actions may influence our strategic and business decisions, including causing us to conduct our business and acquire or dispose of investments  differently than we otherwise would.Our certificate of incorporation contains certain anti-takeover provisions and permits our board of directors to issue preferred stock and additional series of Class B Common Stock without stockholder  approval.Certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation are intended to discourage or delay a hostile takeover of control of us. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of blank check preferred  stock and additional series of Class B Common Stock, which will have such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors. Accordingly, our board of directors is  empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock and/or Class B Common Stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other  rights of the holders of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, Series 1. The preferred stock and additional series of Class B Common Stock could be used to discourage, delay or prevent a change in  control of us that is determined by our board of directors to be undesirable. Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock or additional series of Class B Common Stock, we cannot assure  you that we will not do so in the future.Risks Related to ArbysOur restaurant business is significantly dependent on new restaurant openings, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.Our restaurant business derives earnings from sales at company-owned restaurants, franchise royalties received from all Arbys restaurants and up-front fees from restaurant operators for each new unit opened. Growth  in our restaurant revenues and earnings is significantly dependent on new restaurant openings. Numerous factors beyond our control may affect restaurant openings. These factors include but are not limited to:                our ability to attract new franchisees;    the availability of site locations for new restaurants;    the ability of potential restaurant owners to obtain financing;    the ability of restaurant owners to hire, train and retain qualified operating personnel;16    the availability of construction materials and labor;    construction and development costs of new restaurants, particularly in highly-competitive markets;    the ability of restaurant owners to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all; and    adverse weather conditions.Although as of December 31, 2006, franchisees had signed commitments to open 295 Arbys restaurants over the next six years and have made or are required to make non-refundable deposits of $10,000 per  restaurant, we cannot assure you that franchisees will meet these commitments and that they will result in open restaurants. See Item 1. BusinessBusiness SegmentsRestaurant Franchising and Operations  (Arbys)Franchise Network.Arbys franchisees could take actions that could harm our business.Arbys franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with the standards ARG sets in its agreements with them. ARG also provides training and support to franchisees. However,  franchisees are independent third parties that ARG does not control, and the franchisees own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants. As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise  restaurant rests with the franchisee. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with ARGs standards, the Arbys image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt ARGs  business and operating results.ARGs success depends on Arbys franchisees participation in ARGs strategy.Arbys franchisees are an integral part of ARGs business. ARG may be unable to successfully implement ARGs brand strategies that it believes are necessary for further growth if Arbys franchisees do not  participate in that implementation. The failure of ARGs franchisees to focus on the fundamentals of restaurant operations such as quality, service and cleanliness would have a negative impact on ARGs success.ARGs financial results are affected by the financial results of Arbys franchisees.ARG receives revenue in the form of royalties and fees from Arbys franchisees, which are generally based on a percentage of sales at franchised restaurants. Accordingly, a substantial portion of ARGs financial  results is to a large extent dependent upon the operational and financial success of Arbys franchisees, including their implementation of ARGs strategic plans. If sales trends or economic conditions worsen for Arbys  franchisees, their financial results may worsen and ARGs collection rates may decline. When ARG divests company-owned restaurants, ARG is often required to remain responsible for lease payments for these restaurants  to the extent that the relevant franchisees default on their leases. Additionally, if Arbys franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements, or if ARG is required to restructure its franchise agreements in connection with  such renewal, it would result in decreased revenues for ARG.ARG may be unable to manage effectively its strategy of acquiring and disposing of Arbys restaurants, which could adversely affect ARGs business and financial results.ARGs strategy of acquiring Arbys restaurants from franchisees and eventually re-franchising these restaurants by selling them to new or existing franchisees is dependent upon the availability of sellers and buyers  as well as ARGs ability to negotiate transactions on terms that ARG deems acceptable. In addition, the operations of restaurants that ARG acquires may not be integrated successfully, and the intended benefits of such  transactions may not be realized. Acquisitions of Arbys restaurants pose various risks to ARGs on-going operations, including:                diversion of management attention to the integration of acquired restaurant operations;    increased operating expenses and the inability to achieve expected cost savings and operating efficiencies;    exposure to liabilities arising out of sellers prior operations of acquired restaurants; and    incurrence or assumption of debt to finance acquisitions or improvements and/or the assumption of long-term, non-cancelable leases.17In addition, engaging in acquisitions and dispositions places increased demands on ARGs operational, financial and management resources and may require ARG to continue to expand these resources. If ARG is  unable to manage the acquisition and disposition strategy effectively, its business and financial results could be adversely affected.ARG does not exercise ultimate control over advertising and purchasing for the Arbys restaurant system, which could hurt sales and the Arbys brand.Arbys franchisees control the provision of national advertising and marketing services to the Arbys franchise system through AFA Service Corporation (the AFA), a company controlled by Arbys franchisees. Subject  to ARGs right to protect its trademarks, and except to the extent that ARG participates in the AFA through its company-owned restaurants, the AFA has the right to approve all significant decisions regarding the  national marketing and advertising strategies and the creative content of advertising for the Arbys system. Although ARG has entered into a management agreement pursuant to which ARG, on behalf of the AFA,  manages the day-to-day operations of the AFA, many areas are still subject to ultimate approval by the AFAs independent board of directors and the management agreement may be terminated by either party for any  reason upon one years prior notice. See Item 1. BusinessBusiness SegmentsRestaurant Franchising and Operations (Arbys)Advertising and Marketing. In addition, local cooperatives run by operators of Arbys  restaurants in a particular local area (including ARG) make their own decisions regarding local advertising expenditures, subject to spending the required minimum amounts. ARGs lack of control over advertising could  hurt sales and the Arbys brand.In addition, although ARG ensures that all suppliers to the Arbys system meet quality control standards, Arbys franchisees control the purchasing of food, proprietary paper, equipment and other operating supplies  from such suppliers through ARCOP, Inc., a not-for-profit entity controlled by Arbys franchisees. ARCOP negotiates national contracts for such food, equipment and supplies. ARG is entitled to appoint one  representative on the board of directors of ARCOP and participate in ARCOP through its company-owned restaurants, but otherwise does not control the decisions and activities of ARCOP except to ensure that all  suppliers satisfy Arbys quality control standards. If ARCOP does not properly estimate the needs of the Arbys system with respect to one or more products, makes poor purchasing decisions, or decides to cease its  operations, system sales and operating costs could be adversely affected and the financial condition of ARG or the financial condition of Arbys franchisees could be hurt.Shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of perishable food products could damage the Arbys brand reputation and adversely affect ARGs operating results.ARG and Arbys franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet ARGs specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by  unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, disease or food-borne illnesses, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which would  likely lower ARGs revenues, damage Arbys reputation and otherwise harm ARGs business.Additional instances of mad cow disease or other food-borne illnesses, such as bird flu or salmonella, could adversely affect the price and availability of beef, poultry or other meats and create negative  publicity, which could result in a decline in sales.Instances of mad cow disease or other food-borne illnesses, such as bird flu, salmonella, e-coli or hepatitis A, could adversely affect the price and availability of beef, poultry or other meats, including if additional  incidents cause consumers to shift their preferences to other meats. As a result, Arbys restaurants could experience a significant increase in food costs if there are additional instances of mad cow disease or other food-borne  illnesses.In addition to losses associated with higher prices and a lower supply of our food ingredients, instances of food-borne illnesses could result in negative publicity for Arbys. This negative publicity, as well as any  other negative publicity concerning food products Arbys serves, may reduce demand for Arbys food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to Arbys restaurants. A decrease in guest traffic to Arbys restaurants as a  result of these health concerns or negative publicity could result in a decline in sales at company-owned restaurants or in ARGs royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.18Changes in consumer tastes and preferences and in discretionary consumer spending could result in a decline in sales at company-owned restaurants and in the royalties that ARG receives from franchisees.The quick service restaurant industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions, discretionary spending priorities, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the  type, number and location of competing restaurants. ARGs success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of  discretionary income. Accordingly, ARG may experience declines in sales during economic downturns. Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending or a decline in family food-away-from-home spending  could hurt ARGs revenues, results of operations, business and financial condition.In addition, if company-owned and franchised restaurants are unable to adapt to changes in consumer preferences and trends, ARG and Arbys franchisees may lose customers and the resulting revenues from  company-owned restaurants and the royalties that ARG receives from its franchisees may decline.Changes in food and supply costs could harm ARGs results of operations.ARGs profitability depends in part on its ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs. Any increase in food prices, especially that of beef or chicken, could harm ARGs operating results.  While fuel price increases have increased the costs of transportation and distribution generally, ARGs commodity prices have largely been unaffected by these distribution cost increases in 2006 due to purchase contracts  for commodities, which are managed by ARCOP, that have allowed only limited increases for distribution costs. As these contracts expire and are replaced in 2007, ARG expects to experience more variability in its  commodity prices. In addition, ARG is susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of other factors beyond its control, such as weather conditions, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulations. For  example, increased demand for ethanol as a fuel alternative has increased the cost of corn, which is also used as feed in the production of beef and chicken. Therefore, increases in the cost of corn could increase ARGs food  costs and harm its operating results. ARG cannot predict whether it will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting its purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely  affect ARGs operating results. In addition, ARG may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to its customers.Competition from other restaurant companies could hurt ARG.The market segments in which company-owned and franchised Arbys restaurants compete are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, price, food quality and presentation, service, location, and the  nature and condition of the restaurant facility. Arbys restaurants compete with a variety of locally-owned restaurants, as well as competitive regional and national chains and franchises. Several of these chains compete by  offering high quality sandwiches and/or menu items that are targeted at certain consumer groups. Additionally, many of our competitors have introduced lower cost, value meal menu options. ARGs revenues and those of  Arbys franchisees may be hurt by this product and price competition.Moreover, new companies, including operators outside the quick service restaurant industry, may enter Arbys market areas and target Arbys customer base. For example, additional competitive pressures for prepared  food purchases have come from deli sections and in-store cafes of several major grocery store chains, as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets. Such competitors may have, among other things, lower  operating costs, lower debt service requirements, better locations, better facilities, better management, more effective marketing and more efficient operations. All such competition may adversely affect ARGs revenues  and profits by reducing revenues of company-owned restaurants and royalty payments from franchised restaurants. Many of ARGs competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources  than ARG, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing and marketing strategies in the quick service restaurant industry better than ARG can.Current Arbys restaurant locations may become unattractive, and attractive new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all.The success of any restaurant depends in substantial part on its location. There can be no assurance that current Arbys locations will continue to be attractive as demographic patterns change. Neighborhood or19economic conditions where Arbys restaurants are located could decline in the future, thus resulting in potentially reduced sales in those locations. In addition, rising real estate prices, particularly in the Northeastern  region of the U.S., may restrict the ability of ARG or Arbys franchisees to purchase or lease new desirable locations. If desirable locations cannot be obtained at reasonable prices, ARGs ability to effect its growth  strategies will be adversely affected.ARGs business could be hurt by increased labor costs or labor shortages.Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our company-owned restaurants. ARG devotes significant resources to recruiting and training its managers and hourly employees. Increased labor costs due to  competition, increased minimum wage or employee benefits costs or other factors would adversely impact ARGs cost of sales and operating expenses. In addition, ARGs success depends on its ability to attract, motivate  and retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and staff. If ARG is unable to do so, its results of operations may be hurt.ARGs leasing and ownership of significant amounts of real estate exposes it to possible liabilities and losses, including liabilities associated with environmental matters.As of December 31, 2006, ARG leased or owned the land and/or the building for over 1,000 Arbys restaurants. Accordingly, ARG is subject to all of the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate. In  particular, the value of our real property assets could decrease, and ARGs costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends, supply or demand for the use of the  restaurants, which may result from competition from similar restaurants in the area, and liability for environmental matters.ARG is subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances. These environmental  laws provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner, operator or occupant of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or  toxic substances. Third parties may also make claims against owners, operators or occupants of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such  substances. A number of ARGs restaurant sites were formerly gas stations or are adjacent to current or former gas stations, or were used for other commercial activities that can create environmental impacts. ARG may  also acquire or lease these types of sites in the future. ARG has not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of all of its properties. ARG may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at its  leased and owned properties, and any such liabilities identified in the future could cause ARG to incur significant costs, including costs associated with litigation, fines or clean-up responsibilities.ARG leases real property generally for initial terms of 20 years. Many leases provide that the landlord may increase the rent over the term of the lease. Most leases require ARG to pay all of the costs of insurance,  taxes, maintenance and utilities. ARG generally cannot cancel these leases. If an existing or future restaurant is not profitable, and ARG decides to close it, ARG may nonetheless be committed to perform its obligations  under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each of ARGs leases expires, ARG may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially  acceptable terms or at all, which could cause ARG to close stores in desirable locations.Complaints or litigation may hurt ARG.Occasionally, ARGs customers file complaints or lawsuits against it alleging that ARG is responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to an Arbys restaurant, or alleging that there was a  problem with food quality or operations at an Arbys restaurant. ARG is also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims  from franchisees and claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters. ARG could also become subject to class action lawsuits related to  these matters in the future. Regardless of whether any claims against ARG are valid or whether ARG is found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert managements attention away from operations  and hurt ARGs performance. A judgment significantly in excess of ARGs insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect ARGs financial condition or results of operations. Further, adverse publicity  resulting from these allegations may hurt ARG and Arbys franchisees.20Additionally, the restaurant industry has been subject to a number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of certain of their customers. Adverse publicity resulting from  these allegations may harm the reputation of Arbys restaurants, even if the allegations are not directed against Arbys restaurants or are not valid, and even if ARG is not found liable or the concerns relate only to a single  restaurant or a limited number of restaurants. Moreover, complaints, litigation or adverse publicity experienced by one or more of Arbys franchisees could also hurt ARGs business as a whole.ARGs current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims it may file.ARG currently maintains insurance customary for businesses of its size and type. However, there are types of losses it may incur that cannot be insured against or that ARG believes are not economically reasonable  to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters or acts of terrorism. In addition, ARG currently self-insures a significant portion of expected losses under its workers compensation, general liability and property insurance  programs. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying ARGs reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs, which  could harm ARGs business and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.Changes in governmental regulation may hurt ARGs ability to open new restaurants or otherwise hurt ARGs existing and future operations and results.Each Arbys restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, safety and other agencies in the state and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located. There can be no assurance that ARG  and/or Arbys franchisees will not experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants, which could delay the opening of such restaurants in the future. In addition,  more stringent and varied requirements of local and tax governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.  ARG, and Arbys franchisees, are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions, along with the ADA, family leave mandates and a  variety of other laws enacted by the states that govern these and other employment law matters. As described more fully under Item 3. Legal Proceedings, one of our subsidiaries was a defendant in a lawsuit alleging  failure to comply with Title III of the ADA at approximately 775 company-owned restaurants acquired as part of the RTM acquisition in July 2005. Under a court approved settlement of that lawsuit, ARG estimates  that it will spend approximately $1.0 million per year of capital expenditures over an eight-year period beginning in 2007 to bring these restaurants into compliance with the ADA, in addition to paying certain legal fees  and expenses. ARG cannot predict the amount of any other future expenditures that may be required in order to permit company-owned restaurants to comply with any changes in existing regulations or to comply with  any future regulations that may become applicable to ARGs business.ARGs operations could be influenced by weather conditions.Weather, which is unpredictable, can impact Arbys restaurant sales. Harsh weather conditions that keep customers from dining out result in lost opportunities for Arbys restaurants. A heavy snowstorm in the  Northeast or Midwest or a hurricane in the Southeast can shut down an entire metropolitan area, resulting in a reduction in sales in that area. Our first quarter includes winter months and historically has a lower level of  sales at company-owned restaurants. Because a significant portion of ARGs restaurant operating costs is fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of sales during these periods hurts ARGs operating margins, and can result  in restaurant operating losses. For these reasons, a quarter-to-quarter comparison may not be a good indication of ARGs performance or how it may perform in the future.Due to the concentration of Arbys restaurants in particular geographic regions, ARGs business results could be impacted by the adverse economic conditions prevailing in those regions regardless of the state  of the national economy as a whole.As of December 31, 2006 ARG and Arbys franchisees operated Arbys restaurants in 48 states, the District of Columbia and four foreign countries. As of December 31, 2006, the six leading states by number of  operating units were: Ohio, with 288 restaurants; Michigan, with 191 restaurants; Indiana, with 175 restaurants; Florida, with 175 restaurants; Texas, with 156 restaurants; and Georgia, with 153 restaurants. This  geographic concentration can cause economic conditions in particular areas of the country to have a21disproportionate impact on ARGs overall results of operations. ARG believes that the adverse economic conditions in Ohio and Michigan, two states that have a significant number of Arbys restaurants, have adversely  impacted its results of operations. It is possible that adverse economic conditions in those two states or in other states or regions that contain a high concentration of Arbys restaurants could have a material adverse  impact on ARGs results of operations in the future.ARG and its subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions, and substantially all of their assets are pledged, under a credit agreement.Under its credit agreement, substantially all of the assets of ARG and its subsidiaries (other than real property) are pledged as collateral security. The credit agreement also contains financial covenants that, among  other things, require ARG and its subsidiaries to maintain certain financial ratios and restrict their ability to incur debt, pay dividends or make other distributions, enter into certain fundamental transactions (including  sales of assets and certain mergers and consolidations) and create or permit liens. If ARG and its subsidiaries are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain the funds necessary to make required payments  of interest or principal under, or are unable to comply with covenants of, the credit agreement, they would be in default under the terms of the credit agreement, which would, under certain circumstances, permit the  lenders to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness. You should read the information in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Risks Related to DeerfieldDCM may lose client assets, and thus fee revenue, for various reasons.DCMs success depends on its ability to earn investment advisory fees from the client accounts it manages. Such fees generally consist of payments based on the amount of assets in the account (management fees), and  on the profits earned by the account or the returns to certain investors in the accounts (performance fees). If there is a reduction in an accounts assets, there will be a corresponding reduction in DCMs management fees  from the account, and a likely reduction in DCMs performance fees (if any) relating to the account, since the smaller the accounts asset base the smaller will be the potential profits earned by the account. There could be  a reduction in an accounts assets as the result of investment losses in the account, the withdrawal by investors of their capital in the account, or both. Except for the REIT, investors in the accounts managed by DCM  have various types of withdrawal rights, ranging from the right of investors in separate accounts to withdraw any or all of their capital on a daily basis, the right of investors in hedge funds to withdraw their capital on a  monthly or quarterly basis, and the right of investors in CDOs to terminate the CDO in specified situations. Investors in hedge funds and managed accounts might withdraw capital for many reasons, including their  dissatisfaction with the accounts performance, adverse publicity regarding DCM, DCMs loss of key personnel, errors in reporting to investors account values or account performance, other matters resulting from  problems in DCMs systems technology, investors desire to invest the capital elsewhere, and their need (in the case of investors that are themselves investment funds) for the capital to fund withdrawals by their investors.  DCM could experience a major loss of account assets, and thus advisory fee revenue, at any time.Poor investment performance could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in DCMs revenues.Investment performance is a key factor for the retention of client assets, the growth of DCMs assets under management and the generation of management fee revenue. Poor investment performance could impair  DCMs revenues and growth because:                existing clients might withdraw funds in favor of better performing products, which would result in lower investment management fees for DCM;    DCMs subordinate management fees for a CDO may be deferred;    DCMs ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish; and    DCM might earn minimal or no performance fees.The failure of DCMs investment products to perform well both on an absolute basis and in relation to competing products, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on DCMs business.22DCM derives a substantial portion of its revenues from contracts that may be terminated on short notice.DCM derives a substantial portion of its revenues from investment management agreements with accounts that generally have the right to remove DCM as the investment manager of the account and replace it with  a substitute investment manager. Some of these investment management agreements may be terminated for various reasons, including failure to follow the accounts investment guidelines, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty  and gross negligence, or may not be renewed. With respect to DCMs agreements with some of the CDOs it manages, DCM can be removed without cause by investors that hold a specified amount of the securities issued  by the CDO. All of DCMs agreements with CDOs allow investors that hold a specified amount of securities issued by the CDO to remove DCM for cause, which typically includes DCMs violation of the management  agreement or the CDOs indenture, DCMs breach of its representations and warranties under the agreement, DCMs bankruptcy or insolvency, DCMs fraud or a criminal offense by DCM or its employees, and the failure  of certain of the CDOs performance tests. With respect to DCMs investment management agreement with the REIT, at the end of the initial term of the agreement (which occurs on December 31, 2007) or at the end of  any one-year renewal term thereafter, DCM can be removed as manager by a vote of at least two-thirds of the REITs independent directors or holders of at least a majority of the outstanding common stock of the REIT  based upon unsatisfactory performance that is materially detrimental to the REIT or a determination that the management fees payable to DCM are not fair (subject to DCMs right to prevent such a termination by  accepting a reduction of management fees that at least two-thirds of the REITs independent directors determine to be fair). During 2006, DCM generated approximately 22% of its revenue from managing the REIT.  DCMs investment management agreements with separate accounts are typically terminable by the client without penalty on 30 days notice or less. DCM may not be able to replace these agreements on favorable terms.  The revenue loss that would result from any such termination could have a material adverse effect on DCMs business.DCM could lose client assets as the result of the loss of key DCM personnel.DCM generally assigns the management of its investment products to specific teams, consisting of DCM portfolio management and other personnel. The loss of a particular member or members of such a teamfor  example, because of resignation or retirementcould cause investors in the product to withdraw, to the extent they have withdrawal rights, all or a portion of their investment in the product, and adversely affect the  marketing of the product to new investors and the products performance. In the case of some accounts, such as certain CDOs, DCM can be removed as investment manager upon its loss of specified key employees. In  addition to the loss of specific portfolio management team members, the loss of one or more members of DCMs senior management involved in supervising the portfolio teams could have similar adverse effects on DCMs  investment products.DCM may need to offer new investment strategies and products in order to continue to generate revenue.The segments of the asset management industry in which DCM operates are subject to rapid change. Investment strategies and products that had historically been attractive to investors may lose their appeal for  various reasons. Thus, strategies and products that have generated fee revenue for DCM in the past may fail to do so in the future. In such case DCM would have to develop new strategies and products in order to retain  investors or replace withdrawing investors with new investors. It could be both expensive and difficult for DCM to develop new strategies and products, and there is no assurance that DCM would be successful in this  regard. In addition, alternative asset management products represent a substantially smaller segment of the overall asset management industry than traditional asset management products (such as many corporate bond  funds). DCMs inability to expand its offerings beyond alternative asset management products could inhibit its growth and harm its competitive position in the investment management industry.Changes in the fixed income markets could adversely affect DCM.DCMs success depends largely on the attractiveness to institutional investors of investing in the fixed income markets, and changes in those markets could significantly reduce the appeal of DCMs investment  products to such investors. Such changes could include increased volatility in the prices of fixed income instruments, periods of illiquidity in the fixed income trading markets, changes in the taxation of fixed income23instruments, significant changes in the spreads in the fixed income markets (the amount by which the yields on particular fixed income instruments exceed the yields on benchmark U.S. Treasury securities), and the  lack of arbitrage opportunities between U.S. Treasury securities and their related instruments (such as interest rate swap and futures contracts). The fixed income markets can be highly volatile, and the prices of fixed  income instruments may increase or decrease for many reasons beyond DCMs control or ability to anticipate, including economic and political events and acts of terrorism. Any adverse changes in the fixed income  markets could reduce DCMs revenues.The narrowing of CDO spreads could make it difficult for DCM to launch new CDOs.It is important for DCM to be able to launch new CDO products from time to time, both to expand its CDO activities (which are a major part of DCMs business) and to replace existing CDOs as they are  terminated or mature. The ability to launch new CDOs is dependent on, among other factors, the amount by which the interest earned on the collateral held by the CDO (such as bank loans or corporate bonds) exceeds  the interest payable by the CDO on the debt obligations it issues to investors. If these spreads are not wide enough, the proposed CDO will not be attractive to investors and thus cannot be launched. There may be  sustained periods when such spreads will not be sufficient for DCM to launch new CDO products, which could have a material adverse effect on DCMs business.DCM could lose client assets as the result of adverse publicity.Asset managers such as DCM can be particularly vulnerable to losing clients because of adverse publicity. Asset managers are generally regarded as fiduciaries, and if they fail to adhere at all times to a high level of  honesty, fair dealing and professionalism they can incur large and rapid losses of client assets. Accordingly, a relatively small lapse in this regard, particularly if it resulted in a regulatory investigation or enforcement  proceeding, could materially hurt DCMs business.DCM could incur losses due to trading errors.DCM could make errors in placing transaction orders for client accounts, such as purchasing a security for an account whose investment guidelines prohibited the account from holding the security, purchasing an  unintended amount of the security, or placing a buy order when DCM intended to place a sell order. If the transaction resulted in a loss for the account, DCM might be required to reimburse the account for the loss, or  DCM might choose to do so for client relations purposes. Such reimbursements could be substantial.DCM could lose management fee income from its CDOs because of payment defaults by issuers of collateral held by the CDOs or the triggering of certain structural protections built into CDOs.Pursuant to the investment management agreements between DCM and the CDOs it manages, DCMs management fee from the CDO is generally subject to a waterfall structure, under which DCM will not  receive all or a portion of its fees if, among other things, the CDO does not have sufficient cash flows from its underlying collateral (such as corporate bonds or bank loans) to pay the required interest on the notes it has  issued to investors and certain expenses. This could occur if there are defaults by issuers of the collateral on their payments of principal or interest relating to the collateral. In that event, DCMs management fees would  be deferred until funds are available to pay the fees, if such funds become available. In addition, many CDOs have structural provisions meant to protect investors from deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying  collateral pool. If those provisions are triggered, then certain portions of DCMs management fees may be deferred indefinitely.DCM may be unable to increase its assets under management in certain of its investment vehicles, or it may have to reduce such assets, because of capacity constraints.A number of DCMs investment vehicles are limited in the amount of client assets they can accommodate by the amount of liquidity in the instruments traded by such vehicles, the arbitrage opportunities available  in those instruments, or other factors. Thus, DCM may manage investment vehicles that are relatively successful but that cannot accept additional capital because of such constraints. In addition, DCM might have to  reduce the amount of assets managed in investment vehicles that face capacity constraints. Changes in the fixed income markets could materially reduce capacity, such as an increase in the number of asset managers using  the same or similar strategies as DCM.24The fixed income investment management market is highly competitive and DCM may lose client assets due to competition from other asset managers who have greater resources than DCM does or who are  able to offer services and products at more competitive prices.The alternative asset management industry is highly competitive. Many firms offer similar and additional investment management products and services to the same clients that DCM targets. DCM currently focuses  almost exclusively on fixed income securities and related financial instruments in managing client accounts. DCM has limited experience in investing in equity securities. This is in contrast to numerous other asset  managers with comparable assets under management, which have significant background and experience in both the equity and debt markets. In addition, many of DCMs competitors have or may in the future develop  greater financial and other resources, more extensive distribution capabilities, more effective marketing strategies, more attractive fund structures and broader name recognition. DCMs competitors may be able to use  these resources and capabilities to place DCM at a competitive disadvantage in retaining assets under management and achieving increased market penetration. Also, DCM may be at a disadvantage in competing with  other asset managers that are subject to less regulation and thus less restricted in their client solicitation and portfolio management activities, and DCM may be competing for non-U.S. clients with asset managers that are  based in the jurisdiction of the prospective clients domicile. Because barriers to entry into the alternative asset management business are low, DCM may face increased competition from many new entrants into DCMs  relatively limited market of providing fixed income asset management services to institutional clients. Also, DCM is a relatively recent entrant into the REIT management business and DCM competes in this area against  numerous firms that are larger, more experienced or both.Additionally, if other asset managers offer services and products at more competitive prices than DCM offers, DCM may not be able to maintain its current fee structure. Although DCMs investment management  fees vary from product to product, historically DCM has competed primarily on the performance of its products and not on the level of its investment management fees relative to those of its competitors. In recent years,  however, despite the fact that alternative asset managers typically charge higher fees than traditional managers, particularly with respect to hedge funds and similar products, there has been a trend toward lower fees in the  investment management industry generally. In order to maintain its fee structure in a competitive environment, DCM must be able to continue to provide clients with investment returns and service that make investors  willing to pay DCMs fees. DCM cannot assure you that it will succeed in providing investment returns and service that will allow DCM to maintain its current fee structure. Fee reductions on existing or future business  could have a material adverse effect on DCMs profit margins and results of operations.Changes in laws, regulations or government policies affecting DCMs businesses could limit its revenues, increase its costs of doing business and materially and adversely affect its business.DCMs business is subject to extensive government regulation. This regulation is primarily at the federal level, through regulation by the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and regulation  by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, under the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended. DCM is also regulated by state regulators. The Investment Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on  investment advisers including anti-fraud prohibitions, advertising and custody requirements, disclosure obligations, compliance program duties and trading restrictions. The CFTC regulates commodity futures and option  markets and imposes numerous obligations on the industry. DCM is registered with the CFTC as both a commodity trading advisor and a commodity pool operator and certain of its employees are registered with the  CFTC as associated persons. DCM is also a member of the National Futures Association, the self-regulatory organization for the U.S. commodity futures industry, and thus subject to its regulations. If DCM fails to  comply with applicable laws or regulations, DCM could be subject to fines, censure, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of its registration as an investment adviser, commodity trading  advisor or commodity pool operator. Changes in laws, regulations or government policies could limit DCMs revenues, increase its costs of doing business and materially adversely affect its business.DCM Europes business is subject to extensive government regulation, primarily by the United Kingdom Financial Services Authority under the U.K. Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000. Such regulation is  generally similar to the regulation governing DCM.The non-U.S. domiciled investment funds that DCM manages are regulated in the jurisdiction of their domicile. Changes in the laws or government policies of these foreign jurisdictions could limit DCMs revenues25from these funds, increase DCMs costs of doing business in these jurisdictions and materially adversely affect DCMs business.The level of investor participation in DCMs products may also be affected by the regulatory and self-regulatory requirements and restrictions applicable to DCMs products and investors, the financial reporting  requirements imposed on DCMs investors and financial intermediaries, and the tax treatment of DCMs products. Adverse changes in any of these areas may result in a loss of existing investors or difficulties in attracting  new investors.Other RisksWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brands and hurt our business.Our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brands and  other intellectual property. The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our  branded products in both existing and new markets. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property, either in print or on  the Internet, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the failure of our brands to achieve and maintain market acceptance. This could harm our image,  brand or competitive position and, if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, cause us to incur significant legal fees.We franchise our restaurant brands to various franchisees. While we try to ensure that the quality of our brands is maintained by all of our franchisees, we cannot assure you that these franchisees will not take actions  that hurt the value of our intellectual property or the reputation of the Arbys restaurant system. We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the United States and certain  foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the United States in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be  registered in all of these countries. We cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate. The laws of some foreign  countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.In addition, we cannot assure you that third parties will not claim infringement by us in the future. Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause delays in  introducing new menu items or investment products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. As a result, any such claim could harm our business and cause a decline in our results of operations and  financial condition.One of our subsidiaries remains contingently liable with respect to certain obligations relating to a business that we have sold.In July 1999, we sold 41.7% of our then remaining 42.7% interest in National Propane Partners, L.P. and a sub-partnership, National Propane, L.P. to Columbia Energy Group, and retained less than a 1% special  limited partner interest in AmeriGas Eagle Propane, L.P. (formerly known as National Propane, L.P. and as Columbia Propane, L.P.). As part of the transaction, our subsidiary, National Propane Corporation, agreed that  while it remains a special limited partner of AmeriGas, it would indemnify the owner of AmeriGas for any payments the owner makes under certain debt of AmeriGas (aggregating approximately $138.0 million as of  December 31, 2006), if AmeriGas is unable to repay or refinance such debt, but only after recourse to the assets of AmeriGas. Either National Propane Corporation or AmeriGas Propane, L.P., the owner of AmeriGas,  may require AmeriGas to repurchase the special limited partner interest. However, we believe it is unlikely that either party would require repurchase prior to 2009 as either AmeriGas Propane, L.P. would owe us tax  indemnification payments or we would accelerate payment of deferred taxes, which amount to approximately $36.0 million as of December 31, 2006, associated with our sale of the propane business.Although we believe that it is unlikely that we will be called upon to make any payments under the indemnification described above, if we are required to make such payments it could have a material adverse26effect on our financial position and results of operations. You should read the information in Item. 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital  Resources and in Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Changes in governmental regulation may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results.Certain of our current and past operations are or have been subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or toxic  substances that provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, in certain cases without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such  hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, third parties may make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances.  Although we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with all applicable environmental laws and regulations, we cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the  future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted. We cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with any environmental laws or  regulations or to satisfy any such claims. See Item 1. BusinessGeneralEnvironmental Matters."
4,WEN,WENDY'S CO,2006-04-03,"Risk Factors
.       We wish to caution readers that in addition to the important factors described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the following important factors, among others, sometimes have affected, or in the future could affect, our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results during 2006, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.14Risks Relating to Triarc       A substantial amount of our shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock is concentrated in the hands of certain stockholders.       As of March 15, 2006, Nelson Peltz, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Peter May, our President and Chief Operating Officer, each individually beneficially owned shares of our outstanding Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, Series 1 (including shares issuable upon the exercise of options exercisable within 60 days of March 15, 2006), that collectively constituted approximately 41.9% of our Class A Common Stock, 29.6% of our Class B Common Stock and 39.7% of our total voting power as of March 15, 2006.       Messrs. Peltz and May may from time to time acquire additional shares of Class A Common Stock, including by exchanging some or all of their shares of Class B Common Stock for shares of Class A Common Stock. Additionally, the Company may from time to time repurchase shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock. Such transactions could result in Messrs. Peltz and May together owning more than a majority of our outstanding voting power. As a result, Messrs. Peltz and May would be able to determine the outcome of the election of members of our board of directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring majority stockholder approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. They would also be in a position to prevent or cause a change in control of us. Inaddition, to the extent we issue additional shares of our Class B Common Stock for acquisitions, financings or compensation purposes, such issuances would not proportionally dilute the voting power of existing stockholders, including Messrs. Peltz and May.       Our success depends substantially upon the continued retention of certain key personnel.       We believe that our success has been and will continue to be dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management team. The failure by us to retain members of our senior management team could adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts undertaken by our current management to increase the efficiency and profitability of our businesses. Specifically, the loss of Nelson Peltz, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, or Peter May, our President and Chief Operating Officer, other members of our senior management team or the senior management of our subsidiaries could adversely affect us.       We  are continuing to explore the feasibility, as well as the risks and opportunities,  of a possible corporate restructuring that may involve the spin-off to our stockholders  or other disposition of our ownership interest in Deerfield. If the corporate  restructuring is completed, Messrs. Peltz and May and other members of Triarc's  senior management will no longer be involved in actively managing Arby's  and Deerfield and the success of those businesses will depend to a significant  extent upon the efforts and abilities of their respective senior management  teams following the restructuring. In addition, the Principals have started  the Funds, which are separate and distinct from Triarc and which are being managed  by the Principals and other senior officers of Triarc through the Management  Company formed by the Principals. Although the Principals and other senior officers  continue to serve as officers of, and be compensated by, Triarc, Triarc is making  available the services of the Principals and these officers to the Management  Company. Consequently, the Principals and these officers are no longer providing  their services exclusively to Triarc. See “Item 1. Business—Business  Strategy; Potential Corporate Restructuring.”       We have broad discretion in the use of our significant cash, cash equivalents and investments.       At January 1, 2006, our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments (including restricted cash, but excluding investments related to deferred compensation arrangements) totaled approximately $502 million. The foregoing amounts do not reflect the special cash dividend we paid on March 1, 2006, the regular quarterly dividend we paid on March 15, 2006 or the repurchase of a significant portion of our outstanding Notes in February 2006. We have not designated any specific use for our significant cash, cash equivalents and investment position, other than as previously disclosed in connection with future special cash dividends expected to be declared and paid during 2006. See “Item 1. Business—Business Strategy; Potential Corporate Restructuring” and “—Repurchase of 5% Convertible Notesdue 2023; Right to Convert Notes During 2006 Second Fiscal Quarter” above and “Item 5. Market For Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” below.15       Acquisitions have been a key element of our business strategy, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify appropriate acquisition targets in the future and that we will be able to successfully integrate any future acquisitions into our existing operations.       Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties assimilating new operations and products. In addition, acquisitions may require significant management time and capital resources. We cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital required to finance potential acquisitions on satisfactory terms, that any acquisition would result in long-term benefits to us or that management would be able to manage effectively the resulting business. Future acquisitions, if any, are likely to result in the incurrence of additional indebtedness, which could contain restrictive covenants, or the issuance of additional equity securities, which could dilute our existing stockholders.       We cannot assure you that our proposed corporate restructuring will be successfully implemented.       We  are continuing to explore the feasibility, as well as the risks and opportunities,  of a possible corporate restructuring that may involve the spin-off to our stockholders  or other disposition of our ownership interest in Deerfield. There can be no  assurance that the corporate restructuring will occur or the form, terms or  timing of such restructuring if it does occur. Our failure to implement these  transactions timely and economically could materially increase our costs and  impair our results of operations. Even if the restructuring is completed, there  can be no assurance that the expected benefits to Triarc and its stockholders  would be realized.       Our investment of excess funds may be subject to risk, particularly due to use of leverage and the riskiness of underlying assets.       From time to time we place our excess cash in investment funds managed by third parties or by Deerfield. Some of these funds use substantial leverage in their trading, including through the use of borrowed funds, total return swaps and/or other derivatives. The use of leverage generates various risks, including the exacerbation of losses, increased interest expense in the case of leverage through borrowing, and exposure to counterparty risk in the case of leverage through derivatives. However, volatility in the value of a fund is a function not only of the amount of leverage employed but also of the riskiness of the underlying investments. Therefore, the greater the amount of leverage used by a fund and the greater the riskiness of a fund's underlying assets, the greater the risk associated with our investmentin such fund.       We may be required to take or not take certain actions, such as foregoing investment opportunities, so as not to be deemed an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.       The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), requires the registration of, and imposes various restrictions on the operations of, companies that own “investment securities” having a value exceeding 40% of their assets (excluding government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, absent an available exclusion. We and/or our subsidiaries may be required to take actions that we and/or our subsidiaries would not otherwise take so as not to be deemed an “investment company” under the 1940 Act. Presently, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries is an investment company required to register under the 1940 Act. If we or one of our subsidiaries invests more than 40% of its assets in investment securities, and is unable to rely on an exclusion from beingan investment company, we and/or that subsidiary might be required to register under and thus become subject to the restrictions of the 1940 Act. We and our subsidiaries intend to continue to make acquisitions and other investments in a manner so as not to be an investment company. As a result, we and/or our subsidiaries may forego investments that we and/or our subsidiaries might otherwise make or retain or dispose of investments or assets that we and/or our subsidiaries might otherwise sell or hold.       In the future, we may have to take actions that we would not otherwise take so as not to be subject to tax as a “personal holding company.”       If at any time during the last half of our taxable year, five or fewer individuals own or are deemed to own more than 50% of the total value of our shares and if during such taxable year we receive 60% or more of our gross income, as specially adjusted, from specified passive sources, we would be classified as a “personal holding company” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If this were the case, we would be subject to additional taxes at16the rate of 15% on a portion of our income, to the extent this income is not distributed to shareholders. We do not currently expect to have any liability in 2006 for tax under the personal holding company rules. However, we cannot assure you that we will not become liable for such tax in the future. Because we do not wish to be classified as a personal holding company or to incur any personal holding company tax, we may be required in the future to take actions that we would not otherwise take. These actions may influence our strategic and business decisions, including causing us to conduct our business and acquire or dispose of investments differently than we otherwise would.       Our certificate of incorporation contains certain anti-takeover provisions and permits our board of directors to issue preferred stock and additional series of Class B Common Stock without stockholder approval.       Certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation are intended to discourage or delay a hostile takeover of control of us. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of “blank check” preferred stock and additional series of Class B Common Stock, which will have such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors. Accordingly, our board of directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock and/or Class B Common Stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, Series 1. The preferred stock and additional series of Class B Common Stock could be usedto discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us that is determined by our board of directors to be undesirable. Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock or additional series of Class B Common Stock, we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future.Risks Relating to Arby's       Our restaurant business is significantly dependent on new restaurant openings, which may be interrupted by factors beyond our control.       Our restaurant business derives revenues and earnings from franchise royalties and fees from franchised restaurants and sales in company-owned restaurants. Growth in our restaurant revenues and earnings is significantly dependent on new restaurant openings. Numerous factors beyond our control may affect restaurant openings. These factors include but are not limited to:•our ability to attract new franchisees; •the availability of site locations for new restaurants; •the ability of potential restaurant owners to obtain financing; •the ability of restaurant owners to hire, train and retain qualified operating personnel; •the availability of construction materials and labor; •construction and development costs of new restaurants, particularly in highly-competitive markets; •the ability of restaurant owners to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all; and •adverse weather conditions.       Although as of January 1, 2006, franchisees had signed commitments to open 237 Arby's restaurants over the next six years and have made or are required to make non-refundable deposits of $10,000 per restaurant, we cannot assure you that franchisees will meet these commitments and that they will result in open restaurants. See “Item 1. Business—Business Segments—Restaurant Franchising and Operations (Arby's)—Franchise Network.”       Arby's franchisees could take actions that could harm our business.       Arby's franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with the standards ARG sets in its agreements with them. ARG also provides training and support to franchisees. However, franchisees are independent third parties that ARG does not control, and the franchisees own, operate and17oversee the daily operations of their restaurants. As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with ARG's standards, the Arby's image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt ARG's business and operating results.       ARG's success depends on Arby's franchisees' participation in ARG's strategy.       Arby's franchisees are an integral part of ARG's business. ARG may be unable to successfully implement its brand strategies that it believes are necessary for further growth if Arby's franchisees do not participate in that implementation. The failure of ARG's franchisees to focus on the fundamentals of restaurant operations such as quality, service and cleanliness would have a negative impact on ARG's success.       ARG's financial results are affected by the financial results of Arby's franchisees.       ARG receives revenue in the form of royalties and fees from Arby's franchisees, which are generally based on a percentage of sales at franchised restaurants. Accordingly, a substantial portion of ARG's financial results is to a large extent dependent upon the operational and financial success of Arby's franchisees, including their implementation of ARG's strategic plans. If sales trends or economic conditions worsen for Arby's franchisees, their financial results may worsen and ARG's collection rates may decline. To the extent ARG divests company-owned restaurants in the future, ARG may also be required to assume the responsibility for lease payments for these restaurants if the relevant franchisees default on their leases. Additionally, if Arby's franchisees fail to renew their franchiseagreements, or if ARG is required to restructure its franchise agreements in connection with such renewal, it could result in decreased revenues for ARG.       ARG may be unable to manage effectively its strategy of acquiring and disposing of Arby's restaurants, which could adversely affect ARG's business and financial results.       ARG's strategy of acquiring Arby's restaurants from franchisees and eventually “re-franchising” these restaurants by selling them to new or existing franchisees is dependent upon the availability of sellers and buyers as well as ARG's ability to negotiate transactions on terms that ARG deems acceptable. In addition, the operations of restaurants that ARG acquires may not be integrated successfully, and the intended benefits of such transactions may not be realized. Acquisitions of Arby's restaurants pose various risks to ARG's on-going operations, including:•diversion of management attention to the integration of acquired restaurant operations; •increased operating expenses and the inability to achieve expected cost savings and operating efficiencies; •exposure to liabilities arising out of sellers' prior operations of acquired restaurants; and •incurrence or assumption of debt to finance acquisitions or improvements and/or the assumption of long-term, non-cancelable leases.       In addition, engaging in acquisitions and dispositions places increased demands on ARG's operational, financial and management resources and may require ARG to continue to expand these resources. If ARG is unable to manage its acquisition and disposition strategy effectively, its business and financial results could be adversely affected.       ARG does not exercise ultimate control over advertising and purchasing for the Arby's restaurant system, which could hurt sales and the Arby's brand.       Arby's franchisees control the provision of national advertising and marketing services to the Arby's franchise system through AFA Service Corporation, a company controlled by Arby's franchisees. Subject to ARG's right to protect its trademarks, and except to the extent that ARG participates in AFA through its company-owned restaurants, AFA has the right to approve all significant decisions regarding the national marketing and advertising strategies and the creative content of advertising for the Arby's system. Although ARG has entered into a Management Agreement pursuant to which it manages the day-to-day operations of AFA, many areas are still subject to ultimate approval by AFA's independent Board of Directors and the18Management Agreement may be terminated by either party for any reason upon one year's prior notice. See “Item 1. Business—Business Segments—Restaurant Franchising and Operations (Arby's)—Advertising and Marketing.” In addition, local cooperatives run by operators of Arby's restaurants in a particular local area (including ARG) make their own decisions regarding local advertising expenditures, subject to spending the required minimum amounts. ARG's lack of control over advertising could hurt sales and the Arby's brand.       In addition, although ARG ensures that all suppliers to the Arby's system meet quality control standards, Arby's franchisees control the purchasing of food, proprietary paper and other operating supplies from such suppliers through ARCOP, Inc., a not-for-profit entity controlled by Arby's franchisees. ARCOP negotiates national contracts for such food and supplies. ARG is entitled to appoint one representative on the board of directors of ARCOP and participate in ARCOP through its company-owned restaurants, but otherwise exercises no control over the decisions and activities of ARCOP except to ensure that all suppliers satisfy Arby's quality control standards. If ARCOP does not properly estimate the needs of the Arby's system with respect to one or more products, makes poor purchasing decisions,or decides to cease its operations, system sales and operating costs could be adversely affected and the financial condition of ARG or Arby's franchisees could be hurt.       Shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of perishable food products could damage the Arby's brand reputation and adversely affect ARG's operating results.       ARG and Arby's franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet ARG's specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, disease or food-borne illnesses, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which would likely lower ARG's revenues, damage the Arby's reputation and otherwise harm ARG's business.       Additional instances of mad cow disease or other food-borne illnesses, such as bird flu, could adversely affect the price and availability of beef, poultry or other meats and create negative publicity, which could result in a decline in sales.       Instances of mad cow disease or other food-borne illnesses, such as bird flu, e-coli or hepatitis A, could adversely affect the price and availability of beef, poultry or other meats, including if additional incidents cause consumers to shift their preferences to other meats. As a result, Arby's restaurants could experience a significant increase in food costs if there are additional instances of mad cow disease or other food-borne illnesses.       In addition to losses associated with higher prices and a lower supply of food ingredients, instances of food-borne illnesses could result in negative publicity for Arby's. This negative publicity, as well as any other negative publicity concerning food products Arby's serves, may reduce demand for Arby's food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to Arby's restaurants. A decrease in guest traffic to Arby's restaurants as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could result in a decline in sales at company-owned restaurants or in ARG's royalties from sales at franchised restaurants.       Changes in consumer tastes and preferences and in discretionary consumer spending could result in a decline in sales at company-owned restaurants and in the royalties that ARG receives from franchisees.       The quick service restaurant industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions, discretionary spending priorities, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants. ARG's success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. Accordingly, ARG may experience declines in sales during economic downturns. Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending or a decline in family food-away-from-home spending could hurt ARG's sales, results of operations, business and financial condition.       In addition, if company-owned and franchised restaurants are unable to adapt to changes in consumer preferences and trends, ARG and Arby's franchisees may lose customers and the resulting revenues from company-owned restaurants and the royalties that ARG receives from its franchisees may decline.19       Changes in food and supply costs could harm ARG's results of operations.       ARG's profitability depends in part on its ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs. Any increase in food prices, especially that of roast beef, could harm ARG's operating results. While fuel price increases have increased the costs of transportation and distribution generally, ARG's commodity prices have largely been unaffected by these distribution cost increases in 2005 due to purchase contracts for commodities, which are managed by Arby's purchasing cooperative ARCOP, that have allowed only limited increases for distribution costs. As these contracts expire and are replaced, ARG may experience more variability in its commodity prices. In addition, ARG is susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of other factors beyond ARG's control, such as weather conditions,food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulations. ARG cannot predict whether it will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting its purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect its operating results. In addition, ARG may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to its customers.       Competition from other restaurant companies could hurt ARG.       The market segments in which company-owned and franchised Arby's restaurants compete are highly competitive with respect to, among other things, price, food quality and presentation, service, location, and the nature and condition of the restaurant facility. Arby's restaurants compete with a variety of locally-owned restaurants, as well as competitive regional and national chains and franchises. Several of these chains compete by offering high quality sandwiches and/or menu items that are targeted at certain consumer groups. Additionally, many competitors have introduced lower cost, value meal menu options. ARG's revenues and those of Arby's franchisees may be hurt by this product and price competition.       Moreover, new companies, including operators outside the quick service restaurant industry, may enter Arby's market areas and target Arby's customer base. For example, additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases have recently come from deli sections and in-store cafes of several major grocery store chains, as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets. Such competitors may have, among other things, lower operating costs, lower debt service requirements, better locations, better facilities, better management, more effective marketing and more efficient operations. All such competition may adversely affect ARG's revenues and profits by reducing gross revenues of company-owned restaurants and royalty payments from franchised restaurants. Many of ARG's competitors have substantiallygreater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than ARG, which may allow them to react to changes in pricing and marketing strategies in the quick service restaurant industry better than ARG can.       Current Arby's restaurant locations may become unattractive, and attractive new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all.       The success of any restaurant depends in substantial part on its location. There can be no assurance that current Arby's locations will continue to be attractive as demographic patterns change. Neighborhood or economic conditions where Arby's restaurants are located could decline in the future, thus resulting in potentially reduced sales in those locations. In addition, rising real estate prices, particularly in the Northeastern region of the U.S., may restrict the ability of ARG or Arby's franchisees to purchase or lease new desirable locations. If desirable locations cannot be obtained at reasonable prices, ARG's ability to effect its growth strategies will be adversely affected.       ARG's business could be hurt by increased labor costs or labor shortages.       Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating company-owned restaurants. ARG devotes significant resources to recruiting and training its managers and hourly employees. Increased labor costs due to competition, increased minimum wage or employee benefits costs or other factors would adversely impact ARG's operating expenses. In addition, ARG's success depends on its ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees, including restaurant managers and staff. If ARG is unable to do so, its results of operations may be hurt.20       ARG's leasing and ownership of significant amounts of real estate exposes it to possible liabilities and losses, including liabilities associated with environmental matters.       As of January 1, 2006, ARG leased or owned the land and/or the building for over 1,000 Arby's restaurants. Accordingly, ARG is subject to all of the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate. In particular, the value of ARG's real property assets could decrease, and ARG's costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends and supply or demand for the use of the restaurants, which may result from competition from similar restaurants in the area, as well as liability for environmental matters.       ARG is subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances. These environmental laws provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner, operator or occupant of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. Third parties may also make claims against owners, operators or occupants of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such substances. A number of ARG's restaurant sites were formerly gas stations or are adjacent to current or former gas stations, or were used for other commercial activitiesthat can create environmental impacts. ARG may also acquire or lease these types of sites in the future. ARG has not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of all of its properties. ARG may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at its leased and owned properties, and any such liabilities identified in the future could cause ARG to incur significant costs, including costs associated with litigation, fines or clean-up responsibilities.       ARG leases land generally for initial terms of 20 years. Many leases provide that the landlord may increase the rent over the term of the lease. Most leases require ARG to pay all of the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. ARG generally cannot cancel these leases. If an existing or future restaurant is not profitable, and ARG decides to close it, ARG may nonetheless be committed to perform its obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each of ARG's leases expires, ARG may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause ARG to close stores in desirable locations.       Complaints or litigation may hurt ARG.       Occasionally, customers file complaints or lawsuits against ARG alleging that it is responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to an Arby's restaurant, or alleging that there was a problem with food quality or operations at an Arby's restaurant. ARG is also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of its business, including personal injury claims, contract claims, claims from franchisees and claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters. ARG could also become subject to class action lawsuits related to these matters in the future. Regardless of whether any claims against ARG are valid or whether ARG is found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divertmanagement's attention away from operations and hurt ARG's performance. A judgment significantly in excess of ARG's insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect ARG's financial condition or results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may hurt ARG and Arby's franchisees.       Additionally, the restaurant industry has been subject to a number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of certain of their customers. Adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may harm the reputation of Arby's restaurants, even if the allegations are not directed against Arby's restaurants or are not valid, and even if ARG is not found liable or the concerns relate only to a single restaurant or a limited number of restaurants. Moreover, complaints, litigation or adverse publicity experienced by one or more of Arby's franchisees could also hurt ARG's business as a whole.       ARG's current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims it may file.       ARG currently maintains insurance customary for businesses of its size and type. However, there are types of losses ARG may incur that cannot be insured against or that ARG believes are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters or acts of terrorism. In addition, ARG currently self-insures a significant portion of expected losses under its workers compensation, general liability and property insurance21programs. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying ARG's reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs, which could harm ARG's business and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.       Changes in governmental regulation may hurt ARG's ability to open new restaurants or otherwise hurt ARG's existing and future operations and results.       Each Arby's restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, safety and other agencies in the state and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located. There can be no assurance that ARG, or Arby's franchisees, will not experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants, which could delay the opening of such restaurants in the future. In addition, more stringent and varied requirements of local and tax governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations. ARG, and Arby's franchisees, are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions,along with the ADA, family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted by the states that govern these and other employment law matters. As described more fully under “Item 3. Legal Proceedings,” one of ARG's subsidiaries is a defendant in a lawsuit alleging failure to comply with Title III of the ADA at approximately 775 company-owned restaurants acquired as part of the July 2005 acquisition of the RTM Restaurant Group. Under a proposed settlement of that lawsuit, ARG estimates that it will spend approximately $1.0 million per year of capital expenditures over an eight-year period to bring these restaurants into compliance with the ADA. ARG cannot predict the amount of any other future expenditures that may be required in order to permit company-owned restaurants to comply with any changes in existing regulations or to comply with any future regulations that may becomeapplicable to ARG's business.       ARG's operations could be influenced by weather conditions.       Weather, which is unpredictable, can impact sales at Arby's restaurants. Harsh weather conditions that keep customers from dining out result in lost opportunities for Arby's restaurants. A heavy snowstorm in the Northeast or Midwest or a hurricane in the Southeast can shut down an entire metropolitan area, resulting in a reduction in sales in that area. Our first quarter includes winter months and historically has a lower level of sales at company-owned restaurants. Because a significant portion of ARG's restaurant operating costs is fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of sales during these periods hurts ARG's operating margins, resulting in restaurant operating losses. For these reasons, a quarter-to-quarter comparison may not be a good indication of ARG's performance or how ARG may performin the future.       ARG and its subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions, and substantially all of their assets are pledged, under a credit agreement.       Under ARG's $720 million credit agreement, substantially all of the assets of ARG and its subsidiaries, other than real property, are pledged as collateral security. The credit agreement also contains financial covenants that, among other things, require ARG and its subsidiaries to maintain certain financial ratios and restrict their ability to incur debt, pay dividends or make other distributions, enter into certain fundamental transactions (including sales of assets and certain mergers and consolidations) and create or permit liens. If ARG and its subsidiaries are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain the funds necessary to make required payments of interest or principal under, or are unable to comply with covenants of, the credit agreement, they would be in default under the terms of thecredit agreement, which would, under certain circumstances, permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness.

Such fees generally consist of payments based on the amount of assets in the account (management fees), and on22the profits earned by the account or the returns to certain investors in the accounts (performance fees). If there is a reduction in an account's assets, there will be a corresponding reduction in DCM's management fees from the account, and a likely reduction in DCM's performance fees (if any) relating to the account, since the smaller the account's asset base the smaller will be the potential profits earned by the account. There could be a reduction in an account's assets as the result of investment losses in the account, the withdrawal by investors of their capital in the account, or both. Except for the REIT, investors in the accounts managed by DCM have various types of withdrawal rights, ranging from the right of investors in separate accounts to withdraw any or all of their capital on a daily basis, the right of investors in hedgefunds to withdraw their capital on a monthly or quarterly basis, and the right of investors in CDOs to terminate the CDO in specified situations. Investors in hedge funds and managed accounts may withdraw capital for many reasons, including their dissatisfaction with the account's performance, adverse publicity regarding DCM, DCM's loss of key personnel, errors in reporting to investors account values, account performance or other matters resulting from problems in Deerfield's systems technology, investors' desire to invest the capital elsewhere, and their need (in the case of investors that are themselves investment funds) for the capital to fund withdrawals by their investors. DCM could experience a major loss of account assets, and thus advisory fee revenue, at any time.       Poor investment performance could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in DCM's revenues.       Investment performance is a key factor for the retention of client assets, the growth of DCM's assets under management and the generation of management fee revenue. Poor investment performance could impair DCM's revenues and growth because:•existing clients might withdraw funds in favor of better performing products, which would result in lower investment management fees for DCM; •DCM's subordinate management fees for a CDO may be deferred; •DCM's ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish; and •DCM might earn minimal or no performance fees.       The failure of DCM's investment products to perform well both on an absolute basis and in relation to competing products, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on DCM's business.       DCM derives a substantial portion of its revenues from contracts that may be terminated on short notice.       DCM derives a substantial portion of its revenues from investment management agreements with accounts that generally have the right to remove DCM as the investment manager of the account and replace it with a substitute investment manager. Some of these investment management agreements may be terminated for various reasons, including failure to follow the account's investment guidelines, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty and gross negligence, or may not be renewed. With respect to DCM's agreements with some of the CDOs it manages, DCM can be removed without cause by investors that hold a specified amount of the securities issued by the CDO. All of DCM's agreements with CDOs allow investors that hold a specified amount of securities issued by the CDO to remove DCM for “cause,” which typicallyincludes DCM's violation of the management agreement or the CDO's indenture, DCM's breach of its representations and warranties under the agreement, DCM's bankruptcy or insolvency, DCM's fraud or a criminal offense by DCM or its employees, and the failure of certain of the CDO's performance tests. DCM's investment management agreements with separate accounts are typically terminable by the client without penalty on 30 days' notice or less. DCM may not be able to replace these agreements on favorable terms. The revenue loss that would result from any such termination could have a material adverse effect on DCM's business.       DCM could lose client assets as the result of the loss of key DCM personnel.       DCM generally assigns the management of its investment products to specific teams, consisting of DCM portfolio management and other personnel. The loss of a key member or members of such a team—for example, because of resignation or retirement—could cause investors in the product to withdraw, to the extent they have withdrawal rights, all or a portion of their investment in the product, and adversely affect the marketing of the product to new investors and the product's performance. In the case of some accounts, such as certain CDOs,23DCM can be removed as investment manager upon its loss of specified key employees. In addition to the loss of specific portfolio management team members, the loss of one or more members of DCM's senior management involved in supervising the portfolio teams could have similar adverse effects on DCM's investment products.       DCM may need to offer new investment strategies and products in order to continue to generate revenue.       The segments of the asset management industry in which DCM operates are subject to rapid change. Investment strategies and products that had historically been attractive to investors may lose their appeal for various reasons. Thus, strategies and products that have generated fee revenue for DCM in the past may fail to do so in the future. In such case DCM would have to develop new strategies and products in order to retain investors or replace withdrawing investors with new investors. It could be both expensive and difficult for DCM to develop new strategies and products, and there is no assurance that DCM would be successful in this regard. In addition, alternative asset management products represent a substantially smaller segment of the overall asset management industry than traditional asset management products(such as many corporate bond funds). DCM's inability to expand its offerings beyond alternative asset management products could inhibit its growth and harm its competitive position in the investment management industry.       Changes in the fixed income markets could adversely affect DCM.       DCM's success depends largely on the attractiveness to institutional investors of investing in the fixed income markets, and changes in those markets could significantly reduce the appeal of DCM's investment products to such investors. Such changes could include increased volatility in the prices of fixed income instruments, periods of illiquidity in the fixed income trading markets, changes in the taxation of fixed income instruments, significant changes in the “spreads” in the fixed income markets (the amount by which the yields on particular fixed income instruments exceed the yields on benchmark U.S. Treasury securities), and the lack of arbitrage opportunities between U.S. Treasury securities and their related instruments (such as interest rate swap and futures contracts). The fixed incomemarkets can be highly volatile, and the prices of fixed income instruments may increase or decrease for many reasons beyond DCM's control or ability to anticipate, including economic and political events and acts of terrorism. Any adverse changes in the fixed income markets could reduce DCM's revenues.       The narrowing of CDO spreads could make it difficult for DCM to launch new CDOs.       It is important for DCM to be able to launch new CDO products from time to time, both to expand its CDO activities (which are a major part of DCM's business) and to replace existing CDOs as they are terminated or mature. The ability to launch new CDOs is dependent on, among other factors, the amount by which the interest earned on the collateral held by the CDO (such as bank loans or corporate bonds) exceeds the interest payable by the CDO on the debt obligations it issues to investors. If these “spreads” are not wide enough, the proposed CDO will not be attractive to investors and thus cannot be launched. There may be sustained periods when such spreads will not be sufficient for DCM to launch new CDO products, which could have a material adverse effect on DCM's business.       DCM could lose client assets as the result of adverse publicity.       Asset managers such as DCM can be particularly vulnerable to losing clients because of adverse publicity. Asset managers are generally regarded as fiduciaries, and if they fail to adhere at all times to a high level of honesty, fair dealing and professionalism they can incur large and rapid losses of client assets. Accordingly, a relatively small lapse in this regard, particularly if it resulted in a regulatory investigation or enforcement proceeding, could materially hurt DCM's business.       DCM could incur losses due to trading errors.       DCM could make errors in placing transaction orders for client accounts, such as purchasing a security for an account whose investment guidelines prohibited the account from holding the security, purchasing an unintended amount of the security, or placing a buy order when DCM intended to place a sell order. If the24transaction resulted in a loss for the account, DCM might be required to reimburse the account for the loss, or DCM might choose to do so for client relations purposes. Such reimbursements could be substantial.       DCM could lose management fee income from its CDOs because of payment defaults by issuers of collateral held by the CDOs or the triggering of certain structural protections built into CDOs.       Pursuant to the investment management agreements between DCM and the CDOs it manages, DCM's management fee from the CDO is generally subject to a “waterfall” structure, under which DCM will not receive all or a portion of its fees if, among other things, the CDO does not have sufficient cash flows from its underlying collateral (such as corporate bonds or bank loans) to pay the required interest on the notes it has issued to investors and certain expenses. This could occur if there are defaults by issuers of the collateral on their payments of principal or interest relating to the collateral. In that event, DCM's management fees would be deferred until funds are available to pay the fees, if such funds become available. In addition, many CDOs have structural provisions meant to protect investorsfrom deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying collateral pool. If those provisions are triggered, then certain portions of DCM's management fees may be deferred indefinitely as discussed above.       DCM may be unable to increase its assets under management in certain of its investment vehicles, or it may have to reduce such assets, because of capacity constraints.       A number of DCM's investment vehicles are limited in the amount of client assets they can accommodate by the amount of liquidity in the instruments traded by such vehicles, the arbitrage opportunities available in those instruments, or other factors. Thus, DCM may manage investment vehicles that are relatively successful but that cannot accept additional capital because of such constraints. In addition, DCM might have to reduce the amount of assets managed in investment vehicles that face capacity constraints. Changes in the fixed income markets could materially reduce capacity, such as an increase in the number of asset managers using the same or similar strategies as DCM.       The fixed income investment management market is highly competitive and DCM may lose client assets due to competition from other asset managers who have greater resources than DCM does or who are able to offer services and products at more competitive prices.       The alternative asset management industry is highly competitive. Many firms offer similar and additional investment management products and services to the same clients that DCM targets. DCM currently focuses almost exclusively on fixed income securities and related financial instruments in managing client accounts. DCM has limited experience in investing in equity securities. This is in contrast to numerous other asset managers with comparable assets under management, which have significant background and experience in both the equity and debt markets. In addition, many of DCM's competitors have or may in the future develop greater financial and other resources, more extensive distribution capabilities, more effective marketing strategies, more attractive fund structures and broader name recognition. DCM'scompetitors may be able to use these resources and capabilities to place DCM at a competitive disadvantage in retaining assets under management and achieving increased market penetration. Also, DCM may be at a disadvantage in competing with other asset managers that are subject to less regulation and thus less restricted in their client solicitation and portfolio management activities, and DCM may be competing for non-U.S. clients with asset managers that are based in the jurisdiction of the prospective client's domicile. Because barriers to entry into the alternative asset management business are low, DCM may face increased competition from many new entrants into DCM's relatively limited market of providing fixed income asset management services to institutional clients. Also, DCM is a relatively recent entrant into the REIT management business and DCM competes in this area againstnumerous firms that are larger, more experienced or both.       Additionally, if other asset managers offer services and products at more competitive prices than DCM offers, DCM may not be able to maintain its current fee structure. Although DCM's investment management fees vary from product to product, historically DCM has competed primarily on the performance of its products and not on the level of its investment management fees relative to those of its competitors. In recent years, however, despite the fact that alternative asset managers typically charge higher fees than traditional managers, particularly with respect to hedge funds and similar products, there has been a trend toward lower fees in the25investment management industry generally. In order to maintain its fee structure in a competitive environment, DCM must be able to continue to provide clients with investment returns and service that make investors willing to pay DCM's fees. DCM cannot assure you that it will succeed in providing investment returns and service that will allow DCM to maintain its current fee structure. Fee reductions on existing or future business could have a material adverse effect on DCM's profit margins and results of operations.       Changes in laws, regulations or government policies affecting DCM's businesses could limit its revenues, increase its costs of doing business and materially and adversely affect its business.       DCM's business is subject to extensive government regulation. This regulation is primarily at the federal level, through regulation by the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, under the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended. DCM is also regulated by state regulators. The Investment Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on investment advisers including anti-fraud prohibitions, advertising and custody requirements, disclosure obligations, compliance program duties and trading restrictions. The CFTC regulates commodity futures and option markets and imposes numerous obligations on the industry. DCM is registered with the CFTC as both a commodity trading advisor and a commodity pool operator and certain of its employees areregistered with the CFTC as “associated persons.” DCM is also a member of the National Futures Association, the self-regulatory organization for the U.S. commodity futures industry, and thus subject to its regulations. If DCM fails to comply with applicable laws or regulations, DCM could be subject to fines, censure, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of its registration as an investment adviser, commodity trading advisor or commodity pool operator. Changes in laws, regulations or government policies could limit DCM's revenues, increase its costs of doing business and materially adversely affect its business.       Although DCM is not currently directly regulated outside the United States, the non-U.S. domiciled investment funds that DCM manages are regulated in the jurisdiction of their domicile. Changes in the laws or government policies of these foreign jurisdictions could limit DCM's revenues from these funds, increase DCM's costs of doing business in these jurisdictions and materially adversely affect DCM's business. Furthermore, if DCM expands its business into foreign jurisdictions and establishes offices or subsidiaries overseas, it could become subject to non-U.S. laws and government policies.       The level of investor participation in DCM's products may also be affected by the regulatory and self-regulatory requirements and restrictions applicable to DCM's products and investors, the financial reporting requirements imposed on DCM's investors and financial intermediaries, and the tax treatment of DCM's products. Adverse changes in any of these areas may result in a loss of existing investors or difficulties in attracting new investors.Other Risks       We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brands and hurt our business.       Our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brands and other intellectual property. The success of our business strategy depends, in part, on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both existing and new markets. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property, either in print or on the Internet, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the failure of our brands to achieve andmaintain market acceptance. This could harm our image, brand or competitive position and, if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, cause us to incur significant legal fees.       ARG franchises our restaurant brands to various franchisees. While ARG tries to ensure that the quality of our brands is maintained by all franchisees, we cannot assure you that these franchisees will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property or the reputation of the Arby's restaurant system. We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries26outside of the United States in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. We cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.       In addition, we cannot assure you that third parties will not claim infringement by us in the future. Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause delays in introducing new menu items or investment products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. As a result, any such claim could harm our business and cause a decline in our results of operations and financial condition.       One of our subsidiaries remains contingently liable with respect to certain obligations relating to a business that we have sold.       In July 1999, we sold 41.7% of our then remaining 42.7% interest in National Propane Partners, L.P. and a sub-partnership, National Propane, L.P. to Columbia Energy Group, and retained less than a 1% special limited partner interest in AmeriGas Eagle Propane, L.P. (formerly known as National Propane, L.P. and as Columbia Propane, L.P.). As part of the transaction, our subsidiary, National Propane Corporation, agreed that while it remains a special limited partner of AmeriGas, it would indemnify the owner of AmeriGas for any payments the owner makes under certain debt of AmeriGas (aggregating approximately $138 million as of January 1, 2006), if AmeriGas is unable to repay or refinance such debt, but only after recourse to the assets of AmeriGas. Either National Propane Corporation or AmeriGas Propane, L.P., the ownerof AmeriGas, may require AmeriGas to repurchase the special limited partner interest. However, we believe it is unlikely that either party would require repurchase prior to 2009 as either AmeriGas Propane, L.P. would owe us tax indemnification payments or we would accelerate payment of deferred taxes, which amount to approximately $36.1 million as of January 1, 2006, associated with our sale of the propane business.       Although we believe that it is unlikely that we will be called upon to make any payments under the indemnification described above, if we are required to make such payments it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. You should read the information in “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” and in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.       Changes in governmental regulation may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results.       Certain of our current and past operations are or have been subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances that provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, in certain cases without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, third parties may make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances. Although we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with all applicable environmental laws and regulations, we cannot predict what environmental legislation orregulations will be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted. We cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with any environmental laws or regulations or to satisfy any such claims. See “Item 1.
