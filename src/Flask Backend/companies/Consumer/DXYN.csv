3,DXYN,DIXIE GROUP INC,2024-03-20,"    Risk Factors
In addition to the other information provided in this Report, the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating the results of our operations, future prospects and an investment in shares of our Common Stock. Any of these factors could cause our actual financial results to differ materially from our historical results, and could give rise to events that might have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Table of Contents    6Our financial condition and results of operations have been and could likely be adversely impacted in the future by COVID-19 or other pandemics and the related negative impact on economic conditions.Global and/or local pandemics, such as COVID-19, have negatively impacted areas where we operate and sell our products and services. The COVID-19 outbreak in the second quarter of 2020 had a material adverse effect on our ability to operate and our results of operations as public health organizations recommended, and many governments implemented, measures to slow and limit the transmission of the virus, including shelter in place and social distancing ordinances. Although the accessibility of vaccines and other preventive measures have lessened the impact, new variants may necessitate a return of such restrictive, preventive measures which may have a material adverse effect on our business for an indefinite period of time, such as the potential shut down of certain locations, decreased employee availability, disruptions to the businesses of our selling channel partners, and others. Our suppliers and customers may also face these and other challenges, which could lead to a disruption in our supply chain as well as decreased construction and renovation spending and consumer demand for our products and services. These issues may also materially affect our current and future access to sources of liquidity, particularly our cash flows from operations, and access to financing. The long-term economic impact and near-term financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to, potential near term or long-term risk of asset impairment, restructuring, and other charges, cannot be reliably quantified or estimated at this time due to the uncertainty of future developments.The floorcovering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions and a decline in residential activity or home remodeling and refurbishment could have a material adverse effect on our business. The floorcovering industry, in which we participate, is highly dependent on general economic conditions, such as interest rate levels, consumer confidence and income, corporate and government spending, availability of credit and demand for housing. We derive a majority of our sales from the replacement segment of the market. Therefore, unfavorable economic changes, such as an economic recession, could result in a significant or prolonged decline in spending for remodeling and replacement activities which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The residential floorcovering market is highly dependent on housing activity, including remodeling. The U.S. and global economies, along with the residential markets in such economies, can negatively impact the floorcovering industry and our business. Although the impact of a decline in new housing activity is typically accompanied by an increase in remodeling and replacement activity, these activities typically lag during a cyclical downturn. Additional or extended downturns could cause prolonged deterioration. A significant or prolonged decline in residential housing activity could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We have had significant levels of sales in certain channels of distribution and reduction in sales through these channels could adversely affect our business. A significant amount of our recent past sales were generated through a certain mass merchant retailer. A change in strategy by this customer to emphasize products at a lower price point than we currently offer has limited future sales opportunities with this customer. In response to this loss in sales volume and other factors, we implemented our restructuring plan to consolidate our east coast manufacturing operations to better match production demand. If we are unable to maintain volume in line with expected production capacity, any excess capacity in the manufacturing facilities could result in an unfavorable impact on gross margins due to under absorbed fixed costs. We have significant levels of indebtedness that could result in negative consequences to us.We have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity. Insufficient cash flow, profitability, or the value of our assets securing our loans could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate sufficient funds to satisfy the terms of our senior loan agreements and other debt obligations. Our senior loan agreement and term loans include certain compliance, affirmative, and financial covenants.  The impact of continued operating losses on our liquidity position could affect our ability to comply with these covenants by our primary lenders. Additionally, the inability to access debt or equity markets at competitive rates in sufficient amounts to satisfy our obligations could adversely impact our business. Significant increases in interest rates tied to our floating rate debt could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Further, our trade relations depend on our economic viability and insufficient capital could harm our ability to attract and retain customers and or supplier relationships.Uncertainty in the credit market or downturns in the economy and our business could affect our overall availability and cost of credit.Economic factors, including an economic recession, could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results. Uncertainty in the credit markets could affect the availability and cost of credit.  If banks and financial institutions with whom we have banking relationships enter receivership or become insolvent in the future, we may be unable to access, and we may lose, some or all of our existing cash and cash equivalents to the extent those funds are not insured or otherwise protected by the FDIC.  Market conditions could impact our ability to obtain financing in the future, including any financing necessary to refinance existing indebtedness. The cost and terms of such financing is uncertain. Continued operating losses could affect our ability to continue to access the credit markets under our current terms and conditions.Table of Contents    7If we are not able to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share for our common stock, we may be subject to delisting from The NASDAQ Stock Market. NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) requires that, for continued listing on the exchange, we must maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share. We received notice from NASDAQ on September 27, 2023 that our closing bid price was below $1 per share for 30 consecutive business days.  If we are not able to regain compliance before March 25, 2024, we may be eligible for an additional 180 days provided we meet other listing requirements.  To the extent that we are unable to stay in compliance with the relevant NASDAQ bid price listing rule, there is a risk that our common stock may be delisted from NASDAQ, which would adversely impact liquidity of our common stock and potentially result in even lower bid prices for our common stock.Our stock price has been and could remain volatile, which could further adversely affect the market price of our stock, our ability to raise additional capital. The market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility. Our progress in restructuring our business, our quarterly operating results, our perceived prospects, lack of securities analysts’ recommendations or earnings estimates, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, adverse events related to our strategic relationships, significant sales of our common stock by existing stockholders, and other developments affecting us or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and may adversely affect the price of our common stock. Such market price volatility could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital. We face intense competition in our industry, which could decrease demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.The floorcovering industry is highly competitive. We face competition from a number of domestic manufacturers and independent distributors of floorcovering products and, in certain product areas, foreign manufacturers. Significant consolidation within the floorcovering industry has caused a number of our existing and potential competitors to grow significantly larger and have greater access to resources and capital than we do. Maintaining our competitive position may require us to make substantial additional investments in our product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network and sales and marketing activities. These additional investments may be limited by our access to capital, as well as restrictions set forth in our credit facilities. Competitive pressures and the accelerated growth of hard surface alternatives have resulted in decreased demand for our soft floorcovering products and in the loss of market share to hard surface products. As a result, competition from providers of other soft surfaces has intensified and may result in lower demand for our products. In addition, we face, and will continue to face, competitive pressures on our sales prices and cost of our products. As a result of any of these factors, there could be a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profitability.Our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, long lead times for certain products may make it hard for us to quickly respond to changes in consumer demands. New products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of flooring products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. Failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.Raw material prices will vary and the inability to either offset or pass on such cost increases or avoid passing on decreases larger than the cost decrease to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We require substantial amounts of raw materials to produce our products, including nylon and polyester yarn, as well as wool yarns, synthetic backing, latex, and dyes. Substantially all of the raw materials we require are purchased from outside sources. The prices of raw materials and fuel-related costs have increased significantly due to market conditions and inflationary pressures, the duration and extent of which is difficult to predict. The fact that we source a significant amount of raw materials means that several months of raw materials and work in process are moving through our supply chain at any point in time. We are sourcing the majority of our new luxury vinyl flooring and wood product lines from overseas. We are not able to predict whether commodity costs will significantly increase or decrease in the future. If commodity costs continue to increase in the future and we are not able to reduce or eliminate the effect of the cost increases by reducing production costs or implementing price increases, our profit margins could decrease. If commodity costs decline, we may experience pressures from customers to reduce our selling prices. The timing of any price reductions and decreases in commodity costs may not align. As a result, our margins could be affected.Table of Contents    8Disruption to suppliers of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on us.Nylon yarn is the principal raw material used in our floorcovering products. One of the leading fiber suppliers within the industry had been the exclusive supplier of certain branded fibers upon which we formerly relied. Access to these branded fibers is no longer available. We have developed and are developing products and product offerings using fiber systems from other fiber suppliers, but there can be no certainty as to the success of our efforts to develop and market such products. Additionally, the supply of all nylon yarn and yarn systems has been negatively impacted by a variety of overall market factors. The cost of nylon yarns has risen significantly and availability of nylon yarns has been restricted. Our efforts to develop alternate sources and to diversify our yarn suppliers has been met with success to date; however, supply constraints may impact our ability to successfully develop products and effectively service our customers. An interruption in the supply of these or other raw materials or sourced products used in our business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials or products would disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We continually evaluate our sources of yarn and other raw materials for competitive costs, performance characteristics, brand value, and diversity of supply.We rely on information systems in managing our operations and any system failure, cyber incident or deficiencies of such systems may have an adverse effect on our business. Our businesses rely on sophisticated systems to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data. We rely on these systems to, among other things, facilitate the purchase, manufacture and distribution of our products; receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis; and to maintain accurate and up-to-date operating and financial data for the compilation of management information. We rely on our computer hardware, software and network for the storage, delivery and transmission of data to our sales and distribution systems, and certain of our production processes are managed and conducted by computer. Any damage by unforeseen events or system failure which causes interruptions to the input, retrieval and transmission of data or increase in the service time, whether caused by human error, natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism, various forms of cyber crimes including and not limited to hacking, ransomware, intrusions and malware or otherwise, could disrupt our normal operations. Depending upon the severity of the incident, there can be no assurance that we can effectively carry out our disaster recovery plan to handle a failure of our information systems, or that we will be able to restore our operational capacity within sufficient time to avoid material disruption to our business. The occurrence of any of these events could cause unanticipated disruptions in service, decreased customer service and customer satisfaction and harm to our reputation, which could result in loss of customers, increased operating expenses and financial losses. Any such events could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.  The long-term performance of our business relies on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel.To be successful, we must attract, develop and retain qualified and talented personnel in management, sales, marketing, product design and operations. We compete with other floorcovering companies for these employees and invest resources in recruiting, developing, motivating and retaining them. The failure to attract, develop, motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to various governmental actions that may interrupt our supply of materials. We import most of our luxury vinyl flooring (""LVF""), some of our wood offering, some of our rugs and broadloom offerings. Though currently a small part of our business, the growth in LVF products is an important product offering to provide our customers a complete selection of flooring alternatives. There have been trade proposals that threatened these product categories with added tariffs which would make our offerings less competitive compared to those manufactured in other countries or produced domestically. These proposals, if enacted, or if expanded, or imposed for a significant period of time, would materially interfere with our ability to successfully enter into these product categories and could have a material adverse effect upon our cost of sales and results of operations. Regulatory efforts to monitor political, social, and environmental conditions in foreign countries that produce products or components of products purchased by us will necessarily add complexity and cost to our products and processes and may reduce the availability of certain products. Regulatory efforts to prevent or reduce the risk that certain flooring products or elements of such products are produced in regions where forced or involuntary labor are known or believed to occur will result in increased cost to us as we attempt to ensure that none of our products or components of our products are produced in such regions. Such increased cost may make our products less competitive.Table of Contents    9We may experience certain risks associated with internal expansion, acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments.We continually look for strategic and tactical initiatives, including internal expansion, acquisitions and investment in new products, to strengthen our future and to enable us to return to sustained growth and to achieve profitability. Growth through expansion and acquisition involves risks, many of which may continue to affect us after the acquisition or expansion. An acquired company, operation or internal expansion may not achieve the levels of revenue, profitability and production that we expect. The combination of an acquired company’s business with ours involves risks. Further, internally generated growth that involves expansion involves risks as well. Such risks include the integration of computer systems, alignment of human resource policies and the retention of valued talent. Reported earnings may not meet expectations because of goodwill and intangible asset impairment, other asset impairments, increased interest costs and issuance of additional securities or debt as a result of these acquisitions. We may also face challenges in consolidating functions and integrating our organizations, procedures, operations and product lines in a timely and efficient manner.The diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, level of expenses and operating results. Failure to successfully manage and integrate an acquisition with our existing operations or expansion of our existing operations could lead to the potential loss of customers of the acquired or existing business, the potential loss of employees who may be vital to the new or existing operations, the potential loss of business opportunities or other adverse consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if integration occurs successfully, failure of the expansion or acquisition to achieve levels of anticipated sales growth, profitability or productivity, or otherwise perform as expected, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to various environmental, safety and health regulations that may subject us to costs, liabilities and other obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to various environmental, safety and health and other regulations that may subject us to costs, liabilities and other obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment, to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts. We could incur material expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations, including fines and penalties and increased costs of our operations. Additionally, future laws, ordinances, regulations or regulatory guidelines could give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, producer responsibility regulations regarding end-of-life disposal could impose additional cost and complexity to our business.The Environmental Protection Agency has declared an intent to focus on perceived risks posed by certain chemicals (principally PFOA and PFOAS) previously used by the carpet industry. New or revised regulatory actions could result in requirements that industry participants, including us, incur costs related to testing and cleanup of areas affected by such chemical usage. Other chemicals or materials historically used by the industry and us could become the focus of similar governmental action.Various federal, state and local environmental laws govern the use of our current and former facilities. These laws govern such matters as:•Discharge to air and water;•Handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and waste, and•Remediation of contamination from releases of hazardous substances in our facilities and off-site disposal locations.We are a manufacturer and distributor of flooring products which require processes and materials that necessarily utilize substantial amounts of carbon-based energy and accordingly involve the emission of “greenhouse gasses.” Regulatory monitoring, reporting and, more generally, efforts to eliminate or substantially reduce “greenhouse gasses” will necessarily add complexity and cost to our products and processes decreasing profitability and consumer demand. Additionally, consumer preferences may be affected by publicly announced issues related to “greenhouse gasses” which may negatively affect demand for our products. There can be no assurance that we can cost effectively respond to any such regulatory efforts or that demand for our products can be sustained under such pressures. Our operations also are governed by laws relating to workplace safety and worker health, which, among other things, establish noise standards and regulate the use of hazardous materials and chemicals in the workplace. We have taken, and will continue to take, steps to comply with these laws. If we fail to comply with present or future environmental or safety regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities. However, we cannot ensure that complying with these environmental or health and safety laws and requirements will not adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Table of Contents    10We may be exposed to litigation, claims and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business relating to our products or business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to a variety of work-related and product-related claims, lawsuits and legal proceedings, including those relating to product liability, product warranty, product recall, personal injury, and other matters that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to our business. Such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to successfully defend against or resolve these matters or if our insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy any judgments against us or settlements relating to these matters. Although we have product liability insurance, the policies may not provide coverage for certain claims against us or may not be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities. Further, we may not be able to maintain insurance at commercially acceptable premium levels. Additionally, adverse publicity arising from claims made against us, even if the claims are not successful, could adversely affect our reputation or the reputation and sales of our products.Our business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters, catastrophes, fire or other unexpected events.Many of our business activities involve substantial investments in manufacturing facilities and many products are produced at a limited number of locations. These facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters, such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, or by fire or other unexpected events such as adverse weather conditions or other disruptions to our facilities, supply chain or our customer's facilities. We could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, including damage to our reputation, and/or suffer material losses in operational capacity, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations"
2,DXYN,DIXIE GROUP INC,2023-03-08,"    Risk Factors
In addition to the other information provided in this Report, the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating the results of our operations, future prospects and an investment in shares of our Common Stock. Any of these factors could cause our actual financial results to differ materially from our historical results, and could give rise to events that might have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Table of Contents    6Our financial condition and results of operations have been and will likely continue to be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related downturn in economic conditions.The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact areas where we operate and sell our products and services. The COVID-19 outbreak in the second quarter of 2020 had a material adverse effect on our ability to operate and our results of operations as public health organizations recommended, and many governments implemented, measures to slow and limit the transmission of the virus, including shelter in place and social distancing ordinances. Although the accessibility of vaccines and other preventive measures have lessened the impact, new variants may necessitate a return of such restrictive, preventive measures which may have a material adverse effect on our business for an indefinite period of time, such as the potential shut down of certain locations, decreased employee availability, disruptions to the businesses of our selling channel partners, and others. Our suppliers and customers may also face these and other challenges, which could lead to a disruption in our supply chain as well as decreased construction and renovation spending and consumer demand for our products and services. These issues may also materially affect our current and future access to sources of liquidity, particularly our cash flows from operations, and access to financing. The long-term economic impact and near-term financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to, potential near term or long-term risk of asset impairment, restructuring, and other charges, cannot be reliably quantified or estimated at this time due to the uncertainty of future developments.The floorcovering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions and a decline in residential activity or home remodeling and refurbishment could have a material adverse effect on our business. The floorcovering industry, in which we participate, is highly dependent on general economic conditions, such as interest rate levels, consumer confidence and income, corporate and government spending, availability of credit and demand for housing. We derive a majority of our sales from the replacement segment of the market. Therefore, unfavorable economic changes, such as an economic recession, could result in a significant or prolonged decline in spending for remodeling and replacement activities which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The residential floorcovering market is highly dependent on housing activity, including remodeling. The U.S. and global economies, along with the residential markets in such economies, can negatively impact the floorcovering industry and our business. Although the impact of a decline in new housing activity is typically accompanied by an increase in remodeling and replacement activity, these activities typically lag during a cyclical downturn. Additional or extended downturns could cause prolonged deterioration. A significant or prolonged decline in residential housing activity could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We have significant levels of sales in certain channels of distribution and reduction in sales through these channels could adversely affect our business. A significant amount of our recent past sales were generated through a certain mass merchant retailer. A change in strategy by this customer to emphasize products at a lower price point than we currently offer has limited future sales opportunities with this customer. In response to this loss in sales volume and other factors, we implemented our restructuring plan to consolidate our east coast manufacturing operations to better match production demand. If we are unable to maintain volume in line with expected production capacity, any excess capacity in the manufacturing facilities could result in an unfavorable impact on gross margins due to under absorbed fixed costs. We have significant levels of indebtedness that could result in negative consequences to us.We have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity. Insufficient cash flow, profitability, or the value of our assets securing our loans could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate sufficient funds to satisfy the terms of our senior loan agreements and other debt obligations. Additionally, the inability to access debt or equity markets at competitive rates in sufficient amounts to satisfy our obligations could adversely impact our business. Significant increases in interest rates tied to our floating rate debt could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial results. Further, our trade relations depend on our economic viability and insufficient capital could harm our ability to attract and retain customers and or supplier relationships.Uncertainty in the credit market or downturns in the economy and our business could affect our overall availability and cost of credit.Economic factors, including an economic recession, could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results. Uncertainty in the credit markets could affect the availability and cost of credit. Market conditions could impact our ability to obtain financing in the future, including any financing necessary to refinance existing indebtedness. The cost and terms of such financing is uncertain. Continued operating losses could affect our ability to continue to access the credit markets under our current terms and conditions.Table of Contents    7If we are not able to maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share for our common stock, we may be subject to delisting from The NASDAQ Stock Market. NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) requires that, for continued listing on the exchange, we must maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share. We received notice from NASDAQ on January 30, 2023 that our stock had closed below $1 per share for 30 consecutive business days. If we are not able to regain compliance before July 31, 2023, we may be eligible for an additional 180 days provided we meet other listing requirements. To the extent that we are unable to stay in compliance with the relevant NASDAQ bid price listing rule, there is a risk that our common stock may be delisted from NASDAQ, which would adversely impact liquidity of our common stock and potentially result in even lower bid process for our common stock.Our stock price has been and could remain volatile, which could further adversely affect the market price of our stock, our ability to raise additional capital. The market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility. Our progress in restructuring our business, our quarterly operating results, our perceived prospects, lack of securities analysts’ recommendations or earnings estimates, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, adverse events related to our strategic relationships, significant sales of our common stock by existing stockholders, and other developments affecting us or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and may adversely affect the price of our common stock. Such market price volatility could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital. We face intense competition in our industry, which could decrease demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.The floorcovering industry is highly competitive. We face competition from a number of domestic manufacturers and independent distributors of floorcovering products and, in certain product areas, foreign manufacturers. Significant consolidation within the floorcovering industry has caused a number of our existing and potential competitors to grow significantly larger and have greater access to resources and capital than we do. Maintaining our competitive position may require us to make substantial additional investments in our product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network and sales and marketing activities. These additional investments may be limited by our access to capital, as well as restrictions set forth in our credit facilities. Competitive pressures and the accelerated growth of hard surface alternatives, have resulted in decreased demand for our soft floorcovering products and in the loss of market share to hard surface products. As a result, competition from providers of other soft surfaces has intensified and may result in decreased demand for our products. In addition, we face, and will continue to face, competitive pressures on our sales price and cost of our products. As a result of any of these factors, there could be a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profitability.Our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, long lead times for certain products may make it hard for us to quickly respond to changes in consumer demands. New products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of flooring products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. Failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.Raw material prices will vary and the inability to either offset or pass on such cost increases or avoid passing on decreases larger than the cost decrease to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We require substantial amounts of raw materials to produce our products, including nylon and polyester yarn, as well as wool yarns, synthetic backing, latex, and dyes. Substantially all of the raw materials we require are purchased from outside sources. The prices of raw materials and fuel-related costs have increased significantly due to market conditions and inflationary pressures, the duration and extent of which is difficult to predict. The fact that we source a significant amount of raw materials means that several months of raw materials and work in process are moving through our supply chain at any point in time. We are sourcing the majority of our new luxury vinyl flooring and wood product lines from overseas. We are not able to predict whether commodity costs will significantly increase or decrease in the future. If commodity costs continue to increase in the future and we are not able to reduce or eliminate the effect of the cost increases by reducing production costs or implementing price increases, our profit margins could decrease. If commodity costs decline, we may experience pressures from customers to reduce our selling prices. The timing of any price reductions and decreases in commodity costs may not align. As a result, our margins could be affected.Table of Contents    8Disruption to suppliers of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on us.Nylon yarn is the principal raw material used in our floorcovering products. One of the leading fiber suppliers within the industry had been the exclusive supplier of certain branded fibers upon which we formerly relied. Access to these branded fibers is no longer available. We have developed and are developing products and product offerings using fiber systems from other fiber suppliers, but there can be no certainty as to the success of our efforts to develop and market such products. Additionally, the supply of all nylon yarn and yarn systems has been negatively impacted by a variety of overall market factors. The cost of nylon yarns has risen significantly and availability of nylon yarns has been restricted. Our efforts to develop alternate sources and to diversify our yarn suppliers has been met with success to date; however, supply constraints may impact our ability to successfully develop products and effectively service our customers. An interruption in the supply of these or other raw materials or sourced products used in our business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials or products would disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We continually evaluate our sources of yarn and other raw materials for competitive costs, performance characteristics, brand value, and diversity of supply.We rely on information systems in managing our operations and any system failure or deficiencies of such systems may have an adverse effect on our business. Our businesses rely on sophisticated systems to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data. We rely on these systems to, among other things, facilitate the purchase, manufacture and distribution of our products; receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis; and to maintain accurate and up-to-date operating and financial data for the compilation of management information. We rely on our computer hardware, software and network for the storage, delivery and transmission of data to our sales and distribution systems, and certain of our production processes are managed and conducted by computer. Any damage by unforeseen events or system failure which causes interruptions to the input, retrieval and transmission of data or increase in the service time, whether caused by human error, natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism, various forms of cybercrimes including and not limited to hacking, ransomware, intrusions and malware or otherwise, could disrupt our normal operations. Depending upon the severity of the incident, there can be no assurance that we can effectively carry out our disaster recovery plan to handle a failure of our information systems, or that we will be able to restore our operational capacity within sufficient time to avoid material disruption to our business. The occurrence of any of these events could cause unanticipated disruptions in service, decreased customer service and customer satisfaction and harm to our reputation, which could result in loss of customers, increased operating expenses and financial losses. Any such events could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. On April 17, 2021, we detected a ransomware attack on portions of our information technology systems. We initiated recovery efforts and implemented additional security measures in response. All companies are subject to such attacks by cyber criminals as they become more frequent and their ability to circumvent security measures become more sophisticated. The long-term performance of our business relies on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel.To be successful, we must attract, develop and retain qualified and talented personnel in management, sales, marketing, product design and operations. We compete with other floorcovering companies for these employees and invest resources in recruiting, developing, motivating and retaining them. The failure to attract, develop, motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to various governmental actions that may interrupt our supply of materials. We import most of our luxury vinyl flooring (""LVF""), some of our wood offering, some of our rugs and broadloom offerings. Though currently a small part of our business, the growth in LVF products is an important product offering to provide our customers a complete selection of flooring alternatives. There have been trade proposals that threatened these product categories with added tariffs which would make our offerings less competitive compared to those manufactured in other countries or produced domestically. These proposals, if enacted, or if expanded, or imposed for a significant period of time, would materially interfere with our ability to successfully enter into these product categories and could have a material adverse effect upon the company's cost of goods and results of operations. Regulatory efforts to monitor political, social, and environmental conditions in foreign countries that produce products or components of products purchased by the Company will necessarily add complexity and cost to the Company’s products and processes and may reduce the availability of certain products. Regulatory efforts to prevent or reduce the risk that certain flooring products or elements of such products are produced in regions where forced or involuntary labor are known or believed to occur will result in increased cost to the Company as it attempts to ensure that none of its products or components of its products are produced in such regions. Such increased cost may make the Company’s products less competitive.Table of Contents    9We may experience certain risks associated with internal expansion, acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments.We continually look for strategic and tactical initiatives, including internal expansion, acquisitions and investment in new products, to strengthen our future and to enable us to return to sustained growth and to achieve profitability. Growth through expansion and acquisition involves risks, many of which may continue to affect us after the acquisition or expansion. An acquired company, operation or internal expansion may not achieve the levels of revenue, profitability and production that we expect. The combination of an acquired company’s business with ours involves risks. Further, internally generated growth that involves expansion involves risks as well. Such risks include the integration of computer systems, alignment of human resource policies and the retention of valued talent. Reported earnings may not meet expectations because of goodwill and intangible asset impairment, other asset impairments, increased interest costs and issuance of additional securities or debt as a result of these acquisitions. We may also face challenges in consolidating functions and integrating our organizations, procedures, operations and product lines in a timely and efficient manner.The diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, level of expenses and operating results. Failure to successfully manage and integrate an acquisition with our existing operations or expansion of our existing operations could lead to the potential loss of customers of the acquired or existing business, the potential loss of employees who may be vital to the new or existing operations, the potential loss of business opportunities or other adverse consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if integration occurs successfully, failure of the expansion or acquisition to achieve levels of anticipated sales growth, profitability or productivity, or otherwise perform as expected, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to various environmental, safety and health regulations that may subject us to costs, liabilities and other obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to various environmental, safety and health and other regulations that may subject us to costs, liabilities and other obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment, to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts. We could incur material expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations, including fines and penalties and increased costs of our operations. Additionally, future laws, ordinances, regulations or regulatory guidelines could give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, producer responsibility regulations regarding end-of-life disposal could impose additional cost and complexity to our business.The Environmental Protection Agency has declared an intent to focus on perceived risks posed by certain chemicals (principally PFOA and PFOAS) previously used by the carpet industry. New or revised regulatory actions could result in requirements that industry participants, including the Company, incur costs related to testing and clean up of areas affected by such chemical usage. Other chemicals or materials historically used by the industry and the Company could become the focus of similar governmental action.Various federal, state and local environmental laws govern the use of our current and former facilities. These laws govern such matters as:•Discharge to air and water;•Handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and waste, and•Remediation of contamination from releases of hazardous substances in our facilities and off-site disposal locations.The Company is a manufacturer and distributor of flooring products which require processes and materials that necessarily utilize substantial amounts of carbon-based energy and accordingly involve the emission of “greenhouse gasses.” Regulatory monitoring, reporting and, more generally, efforts to eliminate or substantially reduce “greenhouse gasses” will necessarily add complexity and cost to the Company’s products and processes decreasing profitability and consumer demand. Additionally, consumer preferences may be affected by publicly announced issues related to “greenhouse gasses” which may negatively affect demand for the Company’s products. There can be no assurance that the Company can cost effectively respond to any such regulatory efforts or that demand for the Company’s products can be sustained under such pressures. Our operations also are governed by laws relating to workplace safety and worker health, which, among other things, establish noise standards and regulate the use of hazardous materials and chemicals in the workplace. We have taken, and will continue to take, steps to comply with these laws. If we fail to comply with present or future environmental or safety regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities. However, we cannot ensure that complying with these environmental or health and safety laws and requirements will not adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Table of Contents    10We may be exposed to litigation, claims and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business relating to our products or business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to a variety of work-related and product-related claims, lawsuits and legal proceedings, including those relating to product liability, product warranty, product recall, personal injury, and other matters that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to our business. Such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to successfully defend against or resolve these matters or if our insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy any judgments against us or settlements relating to these matters. Although we have product liability insurance, the policies may not provide coverage for certain claims against us or may not be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities. Further, we may not be able to maintain insurance at commercially acceptable premium levels. Additionally, adverse publicity arising from claims made against us, even if the claims are not successful, could adversely affect our reputation or the reputation and sales of our products.Our business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters, catastrophes, fire or other unexpected events.Many of our business activities involve substantial investments in manufacturing facilities and many products are produced at a limited number of locations. These facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters, such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, or by fire or other unexpected events such as adverse weather conditions or other disruptions to our facilities, supply chain or our customer's facilities. We could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, including damage to our reputation, and/or suffer material losses in operational capacity, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations"
5,DXYN,DIXIE GROUP INC,2022-03-23,"Risk Factors
In addition to the other information provided in this Report, the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating the results of our operations, future prospects and an investment in shares of our Common Stock. Any of these factors could cause our actual financial results to differ materially from our historical results, and could give rise to events that might have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Table of Contents    6Our financial condition and results or operations have been and will likely continue to be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related downturn in economic conditions.The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact areas where we operate and sell our products and services. The COVID-19 outbreak in the second quarter of 2020 had a material adverse effect on our ability to operate and our results of operations as public health organizations recommended, and many governments implemented, measures to slow and limit the transmission of the virus, including shelter in place and social distancing ordinances. Although the accessibility of vaccines and other preventive measures have lessened the impact, a new variant may necessitate a return of such restrictive, preventive measures which may have a material adverse effect on our business for an indefinite period of time, such as the potential shut down of certain locations, decreased employee availability, disruptions to the businesses of our selling channel partners, and others. Our suppliers and customers may also face these and other challenges, which could lead to a disruption in our supply chain as well as decreased construction and renovation spending and consumer demand for our products and services. These issues may also materially affect our current and future access to sources of liquidity, particularly our cash flows from operations, and access to financing. The long-term economic impact and near-term financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to, potential near term or long-term risk of asset impairment, restructuring, and other charges, cannot be reliably quantified or estimated at this time due to the uncertainty of future developments.The floorcovering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions and a decline in residential activity or home remodeling and refurbishment could have a material adverse effect on our business. The floorcovering industry, in which we participate, is highly dependent on general economic conditions, such as consumer confidence and income, corporate and government spending, interest rate levels, availability of credit and demand for housing. We derive a majority of our sales from the replacement segment of the market. Therefore, economic changes that result in a significant or prolonged decline in spending for remodeling and replacement activities could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The residential floorcovering market is highly dependent on housing activity, including remodeling. The U.S. and global economies, along with the residential markets in such economies, can negatively impact the floorcovering industry and our business. Although the impact of a decline in new housing activity is typically accompanied by an increase in remodeling and replacement activity, these activities typically lag during a cyclical downturn. Additional or extended downturns could cause prolonged deterioration. A significant or prolonged decline in residential housing activity could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We have significant levels of sales in certain channels of distribution and reduction in sales through these channels could adversely affect our business. A significant amount of our sales are generated through a certain mass merchant retailer. A change in strategy by this customer to emphasize products at a lower price point than we currently offer will limit future sales opportunities with this customer. The reductions of sales through this channel could adversely affect our business if we are not able to replace the volume through other sales outlets and product offerings. The impact of the event has been minimized due to minimal margins on sales through this channel due to price pressure from the retailer and increased raw material costs for our products. We expect to be able to utilize the production capacity made available to help fulfill the current high demand for residential products. We have significant levels of indebtedness that could result in negative consequences to us.We have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity. Insufficient cash flow, profitability, or the value of our assets securing our loans could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate sufficient funds to satisfy the terms of our senior loan agreements and other debt obligations. Additionally, the inability to access debt or equity markets at competitive rates in sufficient amounts to satisfy our obligations could adversely impact our business. Further, our trade relations depend on our economic viability and insufficient capital could harm our ability to attract and retain customers and or supplier relationships.Uncertainty in the credit market or downturns in the economy and our business could affect our overall availability and cost of credit.Uncertainty in the credit markets could affect the availability and cost of credit. Market conditions could impact our ability to obtain financing in the future, including any financing necessary to refinance existing indebtedness. The cost and terms of such financing is uncertain. Continued operating losses could affect our ability to continue to access the credit markets under our current terms and conditions. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results.Our stock price has been and could remain volatile, which could further adversely affect the market price of our stock, our ability to raise additional capital and/or cause us to be subject to securities class action litigation. The market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility. Our progress in restructuring our business, our quarterly operating results, our perceived prospects, lack of securities analysts’ Table of Contents    7recommendations or earnings estimates, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, adverse events related to our strategic relationships, significant sales of our common stock by existing stockholders, and other developments affecting us or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and may adversely affect the price of our common stock. Such market price volatility could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital. In addition, we may be subject to securities class action litigation as a result of volatility in the price of our common stock, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management’s attention and resources and could harm our stock price, business, prospects, results of operations and financial conditionWe face intense competition in our industry, which could decrease demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.The floorcovering industry is highly competitive. We face competition from a number of domestic manufacturers and independent distributors of floorcovering products and, in certain product areas, foreign manufacturers. Significant consolidation within the floorcovering industry has caused a number of our existing and potential competitors to grow significantly larger and have greater access to resources and capital than we do. Maintaining our competitive position may require us to make substantial additional investments in our product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network and sales and marketing activities. These additional investments may be limited by our access to capital, as well as restrictions set forth in our credit facilities. Competitive pressures and the accelerated growth of hard surface alternatives, have resulted in decreased demand for our soft floorcovering products and in the loss of market share to hard surface products. As a result, competition from providers of other soft surfaces has intensified and may result in decreased demand for our products. In addition, we face, and will continue to face, competitive pressures on our sales price and cost of our products. As a result of any of these factors, there could be a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profitability.Our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, long lead times for certain products may make it hard for us to quickly respond to changes in consumer demands. New products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of flooring products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. Failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.Raw material prices may vary and the inability to either offset or pass on such cost increases or avoid passing on decreases larger than the cost decrease to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We require substantial amounts of raw materials to produce our products, including nylon and polyester yarn, as well as wool yarns, synthetic backing, latex, and dyes. Substantially all of the raw materials we require are purchased from outside sources. The prices of raw materials and fuel-related costs vary significantly with market conditions. The fact that we source a significant amount of raw materials means that several months of raw materials and work in process are moving through our supply chain at any point in time. We are sourcing the majority of our new luxury vinyl flooring and wood product lines from overseas. We are not able to predict whether commodity costs will significantly increase or decrease in the future. If commodity costs increase in the future and we are not able to reduce or eliminate the effect of the cost increases by reducing production costs or implementing price increases, our profit margins could decrease. If commodity costs decline, we may experience pressures from customers to reduce our selling prices. The timing of any price reductions and decreases in commodity costs may not align. As a result, our margins could be affected.Disruption to suppliers of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on us.Nylon yarn is the principal raw material used in our floorcovering products. A significant portion of such yarn has historically been purchased from one supplier. This yarn supplier was one of the leading fiber suppliers within the industry and had been the exclusive supplier of certain branded fiber technology upon which we formerly relied. Access to these branded fibers is no longer available. We have developed and are developing products and product offerings that use other fiber systems, but there can be no certainty that we will be successful in our efforts to develop and market such products. Additionally, the supply of all nylon yarn and yarn systems has been negatively impacted by a variety of overall market factors. The cost of nylon yarns has risen significantly and availability of nylon yarns has been restricted. Our efforts to develop alternate sources and to diversify our yarn suppliers has been accelerated and has met with some success to date; however, continued supply constraints may impact our ability to successfully develop products and effectively service our customers. An interruption in the supply of these or other raw materials or sourced products used in our business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials or products would disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We continually evaluate our sources of yarn and other raw materials for competitive costs, performance characteristics, brand value, and diversity of supply.Table of Contents    8We rely on information systems in managing our operations and any system failure or deficiencies of such systems may have an adverse effect on our business. Our businesses rely on sophisticated systems to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data. We rely on these systems to, among other things, facilitate the purchase, manufacture and distribution of our products; receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis; and to maintain accurate and up-to-date operating and financial data for the compilation of management information. We rely on our computer hardware, software and network for the storage, delivery and transmission of data to our sales and distribution systems, and certain of our production processes are managed and conducted by computer. Any damage by unforeseen events or system failure which causes interruptions to the input, retrieval and transmission of data or increase in the service time, whether caused by human error, natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism, various forms of cybercrimes including and not limited to hacking, ransomware, intrusions and malware or otherwise, could disrupt our normal operations. Depending upon the severity of the incident, there can be no assurance that we can effectively carry out our disaster recovery plan to handle a failure of our information systems, or that we will be able to restore our operational capacity within sufficient time to avoid material disruption to our business. The occurrence of any of these events could cause unanticipated disruptions in service, decreased customer service and customer satisfaction and harm to our reputation, which could result in loss of customers, increased operating expenses and financial losses. Any such events could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. On April 17, 2021, we detected a ransomware attack on portions of our information technology systems. We initiated recovery efforts and implemented additional security measures in response. Despite the best efforts toward the security of computer networks, all companies are subject to such attacks by cyber criminals as they become more frequent and their ability to circumvent security measures become more sophisticated. The long-term performance of our business relies on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel.To be successful, we must attract, develop and retain qualified and talented personnel in management, sales, marketing, product design and operations. We compete with other floorcovering companies for these employees and invest resources in recruiting, developing, motivating and retaining them. The failure to attract, develop, motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to various governmental actions that may interrupt our supply of materials. We import most of our luxury vinyl flooring (""LVF""), some of our wood offering, some of our rugs and broadloom offerings. Though currently a small part of our business, the growth in LVF products is an important product offering to provide our customers a complete selection of flooring alternatives. Recently there have been trade proposals that threatened these product categories with added tariffs which would make our offerings less competitive compared to those manufactured in other countries or produced domestically. These proposals, if enacted, or if expanded, or imposed for a significant period of time, would materially interfere with our ability to successfully enter into these product categories and could have a material adverse effect upon the company's cost of goods and results of operations. We may experience certain risks associated with internal expansion, acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments.We continually look for strategic and tactical initiatives, including internal expansion, acquisitions and investment in new products, to strengthen our future and to enable us to return to sustained growth and to achieve profitability. Growth through expansion and acquisition involves risks, many of which may continue to affect us after the acquisition or expansion. An acquired company, operation or internal expansion may not achieve the levels of revenue, profitability and production that we expect. The combination of an acquired company’s business with ours involves risks. Further, internally generated growth that involves expansion involves risks as well. Such risks include the integration of computer systems, alignment of human resource policies and the retention of valued talent. Reported earnings may not meet expectations because of goodwill and intangible asset impairment, other asset impairments, increased interest costs and issuance of additional securities or debt as a result of these acquisitions. We may also face challenges in consolidating functions and integrating our organizations, procedures, operations and product lines in a timely and efficient manner.The diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, level of expenses and operating results. Failure to successfully manage and integrate an acquisition with our existing operations or expansion of our existing operations could lead to the potential loss of customers of the acquired or existing business, the potential loss of employees who may be vital to the new or existing operations, the potential loss of business opportunities or other adverse consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if integration occurs successfully, failure of the expansion or acquisition to achieve levels of anticipated sales growth, profitability or productivity, or otherwise perform as expected, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Table of Contents    9We are subject to various environmental, safety and health regulations that may subject us to costs, liabilities and other obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to various environmental, safety and health and other regulations that may subject us to costs, liabilities and other obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment, to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts.

While we believe there are other sources of nylon yarns, an unanticipated termination or interruption of our current supply of branded nylon yarn could have a material adverse effect on our ability to supply our products to our customers and have a material adverse impact on our competitiveness if we are unable to replace our nylon supplier with another supplier that can offer similar innovative and branded fiber products. Recently, we have had a disruption in our supply of white dyeable yarns for the commercial market place which has resulted in our taking additional charges for the write down of certain inventories. An interruption in the supply of these or other raw materials or sourced products used in our business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials or products would disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We continually evaluate our sources of yarn for competitive costs, performance characteristics, brand value, and diversity of supply.We rely on information systems in managing our operations and any system failure or deficiencies of such systems may have an adverse effect on our business. Our businesses rely on sophisticated systems to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data. We rely on these systems to, among other things, facilitate the purchase, manufacture and distribution of our products; receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis; and to maintain accurate and up-to-date operating and financial data for the compilation of management information. We rely on our computer hardware, software and network for the storage, delivery and transmission of data to our sales and distribution systems, and certain of our production processes are managed and conducted by computer. Any damage by unforeseen events or system failure which causes interruptions to the input, retrieval and transmission of data or increase in the service time, whether caused by human error, natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism, various forms of cybercrimes including and not limited to hacking, intrusions and malware or otherwise, could disrupt our normal operations. There can be no assurance that we can effectively carry out our disaster recovery plan to handle the failure of our information systems, or that we will be able to restore our operational capacity within sufficient time to avoid material disruption to our business. The occurrence of any of these events could cause unanticipated disruptions in service, decreased customer service and customer satisfaction and harm to our reputation, which could result in loss of customers, increased operating expenses and financial losses. Any such events could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.The long-term performance of our business relies on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel.To be successful, we must attract, develop and retain qualified and talented personnel in management, sales, marketing, product design and operations. We compete with other floorcovering companies for these employees and invest resources in recruiting, developing, motivating and retaining them. The failure to attract, develop, motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to various governmental actions that may interrupt our supply of materials. We import most of our luxury vinyl flooring (""LVF""), some of our wood offering, some of our rugs and broadloom offerings. Though currently a small part of our business, the growth in LVF products is an important product offering to provide our customers a complete selection of flooring alternatives. Recently there have been trade proposals that threatened these product categories with added tariffs which would make our offerings less competitive compared to those manufactured in other countries or produced domestically. These proposals, if enacted, or if expanded, or imposed for a significant period of time, would materially interfere with our ability to successfully enter into these product categories and could have a material adverse effect upon the company's cost of goods and results of operations. Table of Contents    9We may experience certain risks associated with internal expansion, acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments.We continually look for strategic and tactical initiatives, including internal expansion, acquisitions and investment in new products, to strengthen our future and to enable us to return to sustained growth and to achieve profitability. Growth through expansion and acquisition involves risks, many of which may continue to affect us after the acquisition or expansion. An acquired company, operation or internal expansion may not achieve the levels of revenue, profitability and production that we expect. The combination of an acquired company’s business with ours involves risks. Further, internally generated growth that involves expansion involves risks as well. Such risks include the integration of computer systems, alignment of human resource policies and the retention of valued talent. Reported earnings may not meet expectations because of goodwill and intangible asset impairment, other asset impairments, increased interest costs and issuance of additional securities or debt as a result of these acquisitions. We may also face challenges in consolidating functions and integrating our organizations, procedures, operations and product lines in a timely and efficient manner.The diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, level of expenses and operating results. Failure to successfully manage and integrate an acquisition with our existing operations or expansion of our existing operations could lead to the potential loss of customers of the acquired or existing business, the potential loss of employees who may be vital to the new or existing operations, the potential loss of business opportunities or other adverse consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if integration occurs successfully, failure of the expansion or acquisition to achieve levels of anticipated sales growth, profitability or productivity, or otherwise perform as expected, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to various environmental, safety and health regulations that may subject us to costs, liabilities and other obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to various environmental, safety and health and other regulations that may subject us to costs, liabilities and other obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment, to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts. We could incur material expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations, including fines and penalties and increased costs of our operations. Additionally, future laws, ordinances, regulations or regulatory guidelines could give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, producer responsibility regulations regarding end-of-life disposal could impose additional cost and complexity to our business.Various federal, state and local environmental laws govern the use of our current and former facilities. These laws govern such matters as:•Discharge to air and water;•Handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and waste, and•Remediation of contamination from releases of hazardous substances in our facilities and off-site disposal locations.Our operations also are governed by laws relating to workplace safety and worker health, which, among other things, establish noise standards and regulate the use of hazardous materials and chemicals in the workplace. We have taken, and will continue to take, steps to comply with these laws. If we fail to comply with present or future environmental or safety regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities. However, we cannot ensure that complying with these environmental or health and safety laws and requirements will not adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may be exposed to litigation, claims and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business relating to our products or business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to a variety of work-related and product-related claims, lawsuits and legal proceedings, including those relating to product liability, product warranty, product recall, personal injury, and other matters that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to our business. Such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to successfully defend against or resolve these matters or if our insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy any judgments against us or settlements relating to these matters. Although we have product liability insurance, the policies may not provide coverage for certain claims against us or may not be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities. Further, we may not be able to maintain insurance at commercially acceptable premium levels. Additionally, adverse publicity arising from claims made against us, even if the claims are not successful, could adversely affect our reputation or the reputation and sales of our products.Table of Contents    10Our business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters, catastrophes, fire or other unexpected events.Many of our business activities involve substantial investments in manufacturing facilities and many products are produced at a limited number of locations. These facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters, such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, or by fire or other unexpected events such as adverse weather conditions or other disruptions to our facilities, supply chain or our customer's facilities. We could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, including damage to our reputation, and/or suffer material losses in operational capacity, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations"
11,DXYN,DIXIE GROUP INC,2020-03-12,"RISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information provided in this Report, the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating the results of our operations, future prospects and an investment in shares of our Common Stock. Any of these factors could cause our actual financial results to differ materially from our historical results, and could give rise to events that might have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The floorcovering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions and a decline in residential or commercial construction activity or corporate remodeling and refurbishment could have a material adverse effect on our business. The floorcovering industry, in which we participate, is highly dependent on general economic conditions, such as consumer confidence and income, corporate and government spending, interest rate levels, availability of credit and demand for housing. We derive a majority of our sales from the replacement segment of the market. Therefore, economic changes that result in a significant or prolonged decline in spending for remodeling and replacement activities could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The floorcovering industry is highly dependent on construction activity, including new construction, which is cyclical in nature. The U.S. and global economies, along with the residential and commercial markets in such economies, can negatively impact the floorcovering industry and our business. Although the impact of a decline in new construction activity is typically accompanied by an increase in remodeling and replacement activity, these activities typically lag during a cyclical downturn. Although the difficult economic conditions have improved since the last cyclical downturn in 2008, there may be additional downturns that could cause the industry to deteriorate in the foreseeable future. A significant or prolonged decline in residential or commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We have significant levels of sales in certain channels of distribution and reduction in sales through these channels could adversely affect our business. A significant amount of our sales are generated through a certain mass merchant retailer. A significant reduction of sales through this channel could adversely affect our business. Such a shift could occur if this retailer decided to reduce the amount of emphasis on soft surface flooring or determine that our concentration of better goods was not advantageous to their marketing program. We have seen a change in strategy by this customer to emphasize products at a lower price point than we currently offer.We have significant levels of indebtedness that could result in negative consequences to us.We have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity. Insufficient cash flow, profitability, or the value of our assets securing our loans could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate sufficient funds to satisfy the terms of our senior loan agreements and other debt obligations. Additionally, the inability to access debt or equity markets at competitive rates in sufficient amounts to satisfy our obligations could adversely impact our business. Further, our trade relations depend on our economic viability and insufficient capital could harm our ability to attract and retain customers and or supplier relationships.Uncertainty in the credit market or downturns in the economy and our business could affect our overall availability and cost of credit.Uncertainty in the credit markets could affect the availability and cost of credit. Despite recent improvement in overall economic conditions, market conditions could impact our ability to obtain financing in the future, including any financing necessary to refinance existing indebtedness. The cost and terms of such financing is uncertain. Continued operating losses could affect our ability to continue to access the credit markets under our current terms and conditions. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results.Table of Contents    7If our stock price were to fall below $1.00 for an extended time, our common stock may be subject to delisting from The NASDAQ Stock Market. NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) requires that, for continued listing on the exchange, we must maintain a minimum bid price of $1 per share. Should the price of our stock close below $1 per share for 30 consecutive business days we will have 180 days to bring the price per share up above $1. If we are not able stay in compliance with the relevant NASDAQ bid price listing rule, there is a risk that our common stock may be delisted from NASDAQ, which would adversely impact liquidity of our common stock and potentially result in even lower bid process for our common stock.Our stock price has been and could remain volatile, which could further adversely affect the market price of our stock, our ability to raise additional capital and/or cause us to be subject to securities class action litigation. The market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility. Our progress in restructuring our business, our quarterly operating results, our perceived prospects, lack of securities analysts’ recommendations or earnings estimates, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, adverse events related to our strategic relationships, significant sales of our common stock by existing stockholders, and other developments affecting us or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and may adversely affect the price of our common stock. Such market price volatility could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital. In addition, we may be subject to securities class action litigation as a result of volatility in the price of our common stock, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management’s attention and resources and could harm our stock price, business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.We face intense competition in our industry, which could decrease demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.The floorcovering industry is highly competitive. We face competition from a number of domestic manufacturers and independent distributors of floorcovering products and, in certain product areas, foreign manufacturers. Significant consolidation within the floorcovering industry has caused a number of our existing and potential competitors to grow significantly larger and have greater access to resources and capital than we do. Maintaining our competitive position may require us to make substantial additional investments in our product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network and sales and marketing activities. These additional investments may be limited by our access to capital, as well as restrictions set forth in our credit facilities. Competitive pressures and the accelerated growth of hard surface alternatives, have resulted in decreased demand for our soft floorcovering products and in the loss of market share to hard surface products. As a result, competition from providers of other soft surfaces has intensified and may result in decreased demand for our products. In addition, we face, and will continue to face, competitive pressures on our sales price and cost of our products. As a result of any of these factors, there could be a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profitability.Our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, long lead times for certain products may make it hard for us to quickly respond to changes in consumer demands. Recently we have seen the supply of white dyeable yarns for the commercial business decline and that has forced us to transition to new products faster than was originally intended. If we fail to successfully replace those products with equally desirable products to the marketplace, we will lose sales volume. Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of flooring products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. Failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.Raw material prices may vary and the inability to either offset or pass on such cost increases or avoid passing on decreases larger than the cost decrease to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We require substantial amounts of raw materials to produce our products, including nylon and polyester yarn, as well as wool yarns, synthetic backing, latex, and dyes. Substantially all of the raw materials we require are purchased from outside sources. The prices of raw materials and fuel-related costs vary significantly with market conditions. The fact that we source a significant amount of raw materials means that several months of raw materials and work in process are moving through our supply chain at any point in time. We are sourcing the majority of our new luxury vinyl flooring and wood product lines from overseas.  We are not able to predict whether commodity costs will significantly increase or decrease in the future. If commodity costs increase in the future and we are not able to reduce or eliminate the effect of the cost increases by reducing production costs or implementing price increases, our Table of Contents    8profit margins could decrease. If commodity costs decline, we may experience pressures from customers to reduce our selling prices. The timing of any price reductions and decreases in commodity costs may not align. As a result, our margins could be affected.Unanticipated termination or interruption of our arrangements with third-party suppliers of nylon yarn could have a material adverse effect on us.Nylon yarn is the principal raw material used in our floorcovering products. A significant portion of such yarn is purchased from one supplier. Our yarn supplier is one of the leading fiber suppliers within the industry and is the exclusive supplier of certain innovative branded fiber technology upon which we rely. We believe our offerings of this innovative fiber technology contribute materially to the competitiveness of our products. While we believe there are other sources of nylon yarns, an unanticipated termination or interruption of our current supply of branded nylon yarn could have a material adverse effect on our ability to supply our products to our customers and have a material adverse impact on our competitiveness if we are unable to replace our nylon supplier with another supplier that can offer similar innovative and branded fiber products. We have had a disruption in our supply of white dyeable yarns for the commercial market place which has resulted in our taking additional charges for the write down of certain inventories. An interruption in the supply of these or other raw materials or sourced products used in our business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials or products would disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We continually evaluate our sources of yarn for competitive costs, performance characteristics, brand value, and diversity of supply.We rely on information systems in managing our operations and any system failure or deficiencies of such systems may have an adverse effect on our business. Our businesses rely on sophisticated systems to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data. We rely on these systems to, among other things, facilitate the purchase, manufacture and distribution of our products; receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis; and to maintain accurate and up-to-date operating and financial data for the compilation of management information. We rely on our computer hardware, software and network for the storage, delivery and transmission of data to our sales and distribution systems, and certain of our production processes are managed and conducted by computer. Any damage by unforeseen events or system failure which causes interruptions to the input, retrieval and transmission of data or increase in the service time, whether caused by human error, natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism, various forms of cybercrimes including and not limited to hacking, intrusions and malware or otherwise, could disrupt our normal operations. There can be no assurance that we can effectively carry out our disaster recovery plan to handle the failure of our information systems, or that we will be able to restore our operational capacity within sufficient time to avoid material disruption to our business.

Further, our suppliers have experienced disruptions relative to actions taken by the Chinese government to control the COVID-19 coronavirus.We may experience certain risks associated with internal expansion, acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments.We continually look for strategic and tactical initiatives, including internal expansion, acquisitions and investment in new products, to strengthen our future and to enable us to return to sustained growth and to achieve profitability.

The notice also indicated that, in accordance with Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have a period of 180 calendar days, until July 30, 2019, to regain compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2), and that, if at any time before July 30, 2019 the bid price of our common stock closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, NASDAQ would notify us that we have regained compliance with Rule 5550(a)(2).  Following the initial notice, the NASDAQ has determined that for the 12 consecutive business days from February 4 to February 20, 2019, the closing bid price of our common stock has been at $1.00 per share or greater. Accordingly, we have regained compliance with Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).To the extent that we are unable to stay in compliance with the relevant NASDAQ bid price listing rule, there is a risk that our common stock may be delisted from NASDAQ, which would adversely impact liquidity of our common stock and potentially result in even lower bid process for our common stock.Our stock price has been and could remain volatile, which could further adversely affect the market price of our stock, our ability to raise additional capital and/or cause us to be subject to securities class action litigation. The market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility. In 2018, the sales price of our common stock fluctuated from a high of $4.05 per share in the first quarter of 2018 to a low of $0.62 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018.

We are not able to predict whether commodity costs will significantly increase or decrease in the future. If commodity costs increase in the future and we are Table of Contents    8not able to reduce or eliminate the effect of the cost increases by reducing production costs or implementing price increases, our profit margins could decrease. If commodity costs decline, we may experience pressures from customers to reduce our selling prices. The timing of any price reductions and decreases in commodity costs may not align. As a result, our margins could be affected.Unanticipated termination or interruption of our arrangements with third-party suppliers of nylon yarn could have a material adverse effect on us.Nylon yarn is the principal raw material used in our floorcovering products. A significant portion of such yarn is purchased from one supplier. Our yarn supplier is one of the leading fiber suppliers within the industry and is the exclusive supplier of certain innovative branded fiber technology upon which we rely. We believe our offerings of this innovative fiber technology contribute materially to the competitiveness of our products. While we believe there are other sources of nylon yarns, an unanticipated termination or interruption of our current supply of branded nylon yarn could have a material adverse effect on our ability to supply our product to our customers and have a material adverse impact on our competitiveness if we are unable to replace our nylon supplier with another supplier that can offer similar innovative and branded fiber products. An interruption in the supply of these or other raw materials or sourced products used in our business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials or products would disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We continually evaluate our sources of yarn for competitive costs, performance characteristics, brand value, and diversity of supply.We rely on information systems in managing our operations and any system failure or deficiencies of such systems may have an adverse effect on our business. Our businesses rely on sophisticated systems to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data. We rely on these systems to, among other things, facilitate the purchase, manufacture and distribution of our products; receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis; and to maintain accurate and up-to-date operating and financial data for the compilation of management information. We rely on our computer hardware, software and network for the storage, delivery and transmission of data to our sales and distribution systems, and certain of our production processes are managed and conducted by computer. Any damage by unforeseen events or system failure which causes interruptions to the input, retrieval and transmission of data or increase in the service time, whether caused by human error, natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism, various forms of cybercrimes including and not limited to hacking, intrusions and malware or otherwise, could disrupt our normal operations. There can be no assurance that we can effectively carry out our disaster recovery plan to handle the failure of our information systems, or that we will be able to restore our operational capacity within sufficient time to avoid material disruption to our business. The occurrence of any of these events could cause unanticipated disruptions in service, decreased customer service and customer satisfaction and harm to our reputation, which could result in loss of customers, increased operating expenses and financial losses. Any such events could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.The long-term performance of our business relies on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel.To be successful, we must attract, develop and retain qualified and talented personnel in management, sales, marketing, product design and operations.  We compete with other floorcovering companies for these employees and invest resources in recruiting, developing, motivating and retaining them.  The failure to attract, develop, motivate and retain key employees could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to various governmental actions that may interrupt our supply of materials. We import most of our luxury vinyl flooring (""LVF""), some of our wood offering, some of our rugs and broadloom offerings. Though currently a small part of our business, the growth in LVF products is an important product offering to provide our customers a complete selection of flooring alternatives. Recently there have been trade proposals that threatened these product categories with added tariffs which would make our offerings less competitive compared to those manufactured in other countries or produced domestically. These proposals, if enacted, or if expanded, or imposed for a significant period of time, would materially interfere with our ability to successfully enter into these product categories and could have a material adverse effect upon the company's cost of goods and results of operations. We may experience certain risks associated with internal expansion, acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments.We continually look for strategic and tactical initiatives, including internal expansion, acquisitions and investment in new products, to strengthen our future and to enable us to return to sustained growth and to achieve profitability. Growth through expansion and acquisition involves risks, many of which may continue to affect us after the acquisition or expansion. An acquired company, operation or internal expansion may not achieve the levels of revenue, profitability and production that we expect. The combination of an acquired company’s business with ours involves risks. Further, internally generated growth that involves expansion involves risks as well. Such risks include the integration of computer systems, alignment of human resource policies and the retention of valued talent. Reported earnings may not meet expectations because of goodwill and intangible asset impairment, other asset impairments, increased interest costs and issuance of additional securities or debt as a result of these acquisitions. We may also face challenges in consolidating functions and integrating our organizations, procedures, operations and product lines in a timely and efficient manner.Table of Contents    9The diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, level of expenses and operating results. Failure to successfully manage and integrate an acquisition with our existing operations or expansion of our existing operations could lead to the potential loss of customers of the acquired or existing business, the potential loss of employees who may be vital to the new or existing operations, the potential loss of business opportunities or other adverse consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if integration occurs successfully, failure of the expansion or acquisition to achieve levels of anticipated sales growth, profitability or productivity, or otherwise perform as expected, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to various environmental, safety and health regulations that may subject us to costs, liabilities and other obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to various environmental, safety and health and other regulations that may subject us to costs, liabilities and other obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment, to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts. We could incur material expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations, including fines and penalties and increased costs of our operations. Additionally, future laws, ordinances, regulations or regulatory guidelines could give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, producer responsibility regulations regarding end-of-life disposal could impose additional cost and complexity to our business.Various federal, state and local environmental laws govern the use of our current and former facilities. These laws govern such matters as:•Discharge to air and water;•Handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and waste, and•Remediation of contamination from releases of hazardous substances in our facilities and off-site disposal locations.Our operations also are governed by laws relating to workplace safety and worker health, which, among other things, establish noise standards and regulate the use of hazardous materials and chemicals in the workplace. We have taken, and will continue to take, steps to comply with these laws. If we fail to comply with present or future environmental or safety regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities. However, we cannot ensure that complying with these environmental or health and safety laws and requirements will not adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may be exposed to litigation, claims and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business relating to our products or business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to a variety of work-related and product-related claims, lawsuits and legal proceedings, including those relating to product liability, product warranty, product recall, personal injury, and other matters that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to our business. Such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to successfully defend against or resolve these matters or if our insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy any judgments against us or settlements relating to these matters. Although we have product liability insurance, the policies may not provide coverage for certain claims against us or may not be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities. Further, we may not be able to maintain insurance at commercially acceptable premium levels. Additionally, adverse publicity arising from claims made against us, even if the claims are not successful, could adversely affect our reputation or the reputation and sales of our products.Our business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters, catastrophes, fire or other unexpected events.Many of our business activities involve substantial investments in manufacturing facilities and many products are produced at a limited number of locations. These facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters, such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, or by fire or other unexpected events such as adverse weather conditions or other disruptions to our facilities, supply chain or our customer's facilities. We could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, including damage to our reputation, and/or suffer material losses in operational capacity, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations"
0,DXYN,DIXIE GROUP INC,2018-03-13,"RISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information provided in this Report, the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating the results of our operations, future prospects and an investment in shares of our Common Stock. Any of these factors could cause our actual financial results to differ materially from our historical results, and could give rise to events that might have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The floorcovering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions and a decline in residential or commercial construction activity or corporate remodeling and refurbishment could have a material adverse effect on our business. The floorcovering industry, in which we participate, is highly dependent on general economic conditions, such as consumer confidence and income, corporate and government spending, interest rate levels, availability of credit and demand for housing. We derive a majority of our sales from the replacement segment of the market. Therefore, economic changes that result in a significant or prolonged decline in spending for remodeling and replacement activities could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The floorcovering industry is highly dependent on construction activity, including new construction, which is cyclical in nature. The U.S. and global economies, along with the residential and commercial markets in such economies, can negatively impact the floorcovering industry and our business. Although the impact of a decline in new construction activity is typically accompanied by an increase in remodeling and replacement activity, these activities typically lag during a cyclical downturn. Although the difficult economic conditions have improved since the last cyclical downturn in 2008, there may be additional downturns that could cause the industry to deteriorate in the foreseeable future. A significant or prolonged decline in residential or commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We have significant levels of sales in certain channels of distribution and reduction in sales through these channels could adversely affect our business. A significant amount of our sales are generated through certain retail and mass merchant channels of distribution. A significant reduction of sales through such channels could adversely affect our business.We have significant levels of indebtedness that could result in negative consequences to us.We have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity. Insufficient cash flow, profitability or the value of our assets securing our loans could materially adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient funds to satisfy the terms of our senior loan agreements and other debt obligations. Additionally, the inability to access debt or equity markets at competitive rates in sufficient amounts to satisfy our obligations could adversely impact our business.Uncertainty in the credit market or downturns in the economy and our business could affect our overall availability and cost of credit.Uncertainty in the credit markets could affect the availability and cost of credit. Despite recent improvement in overall economic conditions, market conditions could impact our ability to obtain financing in the future, including any financing necessary to refinance existing indebtedness. The cost and terms of such financing is uncertain. Continued operating losses could affect our ability to continue to access the credit markets under our current terms and conditions. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results.We face intense competition in our industry, which could decrease demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.The floorcovering industry is highly competitive. We face competition from a number of domestic manufacturers and independent distributors of floorcovering products and, in certain product areas, foreign manufacturers. Significant consolidation within the floorcovering industry has caused a number of our existing and potential competitors to grow significantly larger and have greater Table of Contents    7access to resources and capital than we do. Maintaining our competitive position may require us to make substantial additional investments in our product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network and sales and marketing activities. These additional investments may be limited by our access to capital, as well as restrictions set forth in our credit facilities. Competitive pressures and the accelerated growth of hard surface alternatives, have resulted in decreased demand for our soft floorcovering products and in the loss of market share to hard surface products. As a result, competition from providers of other soft surfaces has intensified and may result in decreased demand for our products. In addition, we face, and will continue to face, competitive pressures on our sales price and cost of our products. As a result of any of these factors, there could be a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profitability.Our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, long lead times for certain of our products may make it hard for us to quickly respond to changes in consumer demands. Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of flooring products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. Failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.Raw material prices may vary and the inability to either offset or pass on such cost increases or avoid passing on decreases larger than the cost decrease to our customers could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We require substantial amounts of raw materials to produce our products, including nylon and polyester yarn, as well as wool yarns, synthetic backing, latex, and dyes. Substantially all of the raw materials we require are purchased from outside sources. The prices of raw materials and fuel-related costs vary significantly with market conditions. The fact that we source a significant amount of raw materials means that several months of raw materials and work in process are moving through our supply chain at any point in time. We are sourcing the majority of our new luxury vinyl flooring and wood product lines from overseas.  We are not able to predict whether commodity costs will significantly increase or decrease in the future. If commodity costs increase in the future and we are not able to reduce or eliminate the effect of the cost increases by reducing production costs or implementing price increases, our profit margins could decrease. If commodity costs decline, we may experience pressures from customers to reduce our selling prices. The timing of any price reductions and decreases in commodity costs may not align. As a result, our margins could be affected.Unanticipated termination or interruption of our arrangements with third-party suppliers of nylon yarn could have a material adverse effect on us.Nylon yarn is the principal raw material used in our floorcovering products.

We rely on our computer hardware, software and network for the storage, delivery and transmission of data to our sales and distribution systems, and certain of our production processes are managed and conducted by computer. Any damage by unforeseen events or system failure which causes interruptions to the input, retrieval and transmission of data or increase in the service time, whether caused by human error, natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism, various forms of cybercrimes including and not limited to hacking, intrusions and malware or otherwise, could disrupt our normal operations. There can be no assurance that we can effectively carry out our disaster recovery plan to handle the failure of our information systems, or that we will be able to restore our operational capacity within sufficient time to avoid material disruption to our business.

We may be exposed to litigation, claims and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business relating to our products or business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to a variety of work-related and product-related claims, lawsuits and legal proceedings, including those relating to product liability, product warranty, product recall, personal injury, and other matters that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to our business. Such matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to successfully defend against or resolve these matters or if our insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy any judgments against us or settlements relating to these matters. Although we have product liability insurance, the policies may not provide coverage for certain claims against us or may not be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities. Further, we may not be able to maintain insurance at commercially acceptable premium levels. Additionally, adverse publicity arising from claims made against us, even if the claims are not successful, could adversely affect our reputation or the reputation and sales of our products.Table of Contents    9Our business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters, catastrophes, fire or other unexpected events.Many of our business activities involve substantial investments in manufacturing facilities and many products are produced at a limited number of locations. These facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters, such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, or by fire or other unexpected events such as adverse weather conditions or other disruptions to our facilities, supply chain or our customer's facilities. We could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, including damage to our reputation, and/or suffer material losses in operational capacity, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations"
1,DXYN,DIXIE GROUP INC,2016-03-09,"RISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information provided in this Report, the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating the results of our operations, future prospects and an investment in shares of our Common Stock. Any of these factors could cause our actual financial results to differ materially from our historical results, and could give rise to events that might have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The floorcovering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions and a decline in residential or commercial construction activity or corporate remodeling and refurbishment could have a material adverse effect on our business. The floorcovering industry, in which the Company participates, is highly dependent on general economic conditions, such as consumer confidence and income, corporate and government spending, interest rate levels, availability of credit and demand for housing. The Company derives a majority of its sales from the replacement segment of the market. Therefore, economic changes that result in a significant or prolonged decline in spending for remodeling and replacement activities could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.The floorcovering industry is highly dependent on construction activity, including new construction, which is cyclical in nature, and experienced a downturn in 2008. The 2008 downturn in the U.S. and global economies, along with the residential and commercial markets in such economies, negatively impacted the floorcovering industry and the Company’s business. Although the impact of a decline in new construction activity is typically accompanied by an increase in remodeling and replacement activity, these activities lagged during the downturn. Although the difficult economic conditions have improved, there may be additional downturns that could cause the industry to deteriorate in the foreseeable future. A significant or prolonged decline in residential or commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.We have significant levels of sales in certain channels of distribution and reduction in sales through these channels could adversely affect our business. A significant amount of our sales are generated through certain retail and mass merchant channels of distribution. A significant reduction of sales through such channels could adversely affect our business.We have significant levels of indebtedness that could result in negative consequences to us.We have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity. Insufficient cash flow, profitability or the value of our assets securing our loans could materially adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient funds to satisfy the terms of our senior loan agreements and other debt obligations. Additionally, the inability to access debt or equity markets at competitive rates in sufficient amounts to satisfy our obligations could adversely impact our business.Uncertainty in the credit market or downturns in the economy and our business could affect our overall availability and cost of credit.Uncertainty in the credit markets could affect the availability and cost of credit. Despite recent improvement in overall economic conditions, market conditions could impact our ability to obtain financing in the future, including any financing necessary to refinance existing indebtedness. The cost and terms of such financing is uncertain. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on its financial condition and operating results.We face intense competition in our industry, which could decrease demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.The floorcovering industry is highly competitive. We face competition from a number of domestic manufacturers and independent distributors of floorcovering products and, in certain product areas, foreign manufacturers. Significant consolidation within the floorcovering industry has caused a number of our existing and potential competitors to grow significantly larger and have greater access to resources and capital than we do. Maintaining our competitive position may require us to make substantial additional investments in our product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network and sales and marketing activities. These additional investments may be limited by our access to capital, as well as restrictions set forth in our credit facilities. Competitive pressures, both from other providers of soft surfaces and the growth of hard surface alternatives, may also result in decreased demand for our products and in the loss of market share. In addition, we face, and will continue to face, competitive pressures on our sales price and cost of our products. As a result of any of these factors, there could be a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profitability.Table of Contents    7Our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, long lead times for certain of our products may make it hard for us to quickly respond to changes in consumer demands. Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of flooring products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. Failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.Raw material prices may vary and the inability to either offset or pass on such cost increases or avoid passing on decreases larger than the cost decrease to our customers could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We require substantial amounts of raw materials to produce our products, including nylon and polyester yarn, as well as wool yarns, synthetic backing, latex, and dyes. Substantially all of the raw materials we require are purchased from outside sources. The prices of raw materials and fuel-related costs vary significantly with market conditions. The fact that we source a significant amount of raw materials means that several months of raw materials and work in process are moving through our supply chain at any point in time. We are not able to predict whether commodity costs will significantly increase or decrease in the future. If commodity costs increase in the future and we are not able to reduce or eliminate the effect of the cost increases by reducing production costs or implementing price increases, our profit margins could decrease. If commodity costs decline, we may experience pressures from customers to reduce our selling prices. The timing of any price reductions and decreases in commodity costs may not align. As a result, our margins could be affected.Unanticipated termination or interruption of our arrangements with third-party suppliers of nylon yarn could have a material adverse effect on us.Nylon yarn is the principal raw material used in our floorcovering products. A significant portion of such yarn is purchased from one supplier. Our yarn supplier is one of the leading fiber suppliers within the industry and is the exclusive supplier of certain innovative branded fiber technology upon which we rely. We believe our offerings of this innovative fiber technology contribute materially to the competitiveness of our products. While we believe there are other sources of nylon yarns, an unanticipated termination or interruption of our current supply of nylon yarn could have a material adverse effect on our ability to supply our product to our customers and have a material adverse impact on our competitiveness if we are unable to replace our nylon supplier with another supplier that can offer similar innovative fiber products. An interruption in the supply of these or other raw materials or sourced products used in the Company’s business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials or products would disrupt the Company’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.We may experience certain risks associated with internal expansion, acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments.We have recently embarked on several strategic and tactical initiatives, including aggressive internal expansion, acquisitions and investment in new products, to strengthen our future and to enable us to return to sustained growth and profitability. Growth through expansion and acquisition involves risks, many of which may continue to affect us after the acquisition or expansion. An acquired company, operation or internal expansion may not achieve the levels of revenue, profitability and production that we expect. The combination of an acquired company’s business with ours involves risks. Further, internally generated growth that involves expansion involves risks as well. Such risks include the integration of computer systems, alignment of human resource policies and the retention of valued talent. Reported earnings may not meet expectations because of goodwill and intangible asset impairment, other asset impairments, increased interest costs and issuance of additional securities or debt as a result of these acquisitions. We may also face challenges in consolidating functions and integrating our organizations, procedures, operations and product lines in a timely and efficient manner.The diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, level of expenses and operating results. Failure to successfully manage and integrate an acquisition with our existing operations or expansion of our existing operations could lead to the potential loss of customers of the acquired or existing business, the potential loss of employees who may be vital to the new or existing operations, the potential loss of business opportunities or other adverse consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if integration occurs successfully, failure of the expansion or acquisition to achieve levels of anticipated sales growth, profitability or productivity, or otherwise perform as expected, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to various environmental, safety and health regulations that may subject us to costs, liabilities and other obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to various environmental, safety and health and other regulations that may subject us to costs, liabilities and other obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment, to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts. We could incur material expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations, including fines and penalties and increased costs of its operations. Additionally, future laws, ordinances or regulations could give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that Table of Contents    8could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, producer responsibility regulations regarding end-of-life disposal could impose additional cost and complexity to our business.Various federal, state and local environmental laws govern the use of our current and former facilities. These laws govern such matters as:•Discharge to air and water;•Handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and waste, and•Remediation of contamination from releases of hazardous substances in our facilities and off-site disposal locations.Our operations also are governed by laws relating to workplace safety and worker health, which, among other things, establish noise standards and regulate the use of hazardous materials and chemicals in the workplace. We have taken, and will continue to take, steps to comply with these laws. If we fail to comply with present or future environmental or safety regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities. However, we cannot ensure that complying with these environmental or health and safety laws and requirements will not adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may be exposed to litigation, claims and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business relating to our products or business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to a variety of work-related and product-related claims, lawsuits and legal proceedings, including those relating to product liability, product warranty, product recall, personal injury, and other matters that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to our business.

9,DXYN,DIXIE GROUP INC,2013-03-25,"    RISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information provided in this Report, the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating the results of our operations, future prospects and an investment in shares of our Common Stock.  Any of these factors could cause our actual financial results to differ materially from our historical results, and could give rise to events that might have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The floorcovering industry is cyclical and prolonged declines in residential or commercial construction activity or corporate remodeling and refurbishment could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Factors that affect such declines may include: •consumer confidence;•housing demand;•financing availability;•national and local economic conditions;•interest rates;•employment levels;Table of Contents    6•changes in disposable income;•commercial rental vacancy rates; and•federal and state income tax policies. Our product concentration in the higher-end of the residential and commercial markets could significantly affect the impact of these factors on our business.We have significant levels of sales in certain channels of distribution.A significant amount of our sales are generated through certain retail and mass merchant channels of distribution.  A significant reduction of sales through these channels could adversely affect our results. We have significant levels of indebtedness. We have significant amounts of debt relative to our equity.  If our cash flow or profitability are insufficient, the value of our assets securing our loans are insufficient or we are unable to access the debt or equity markets at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts, it could materially adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient funds to satisfy the terms of our senior loan agreements and other debt obligations. We face intense competition in our industry, which could decrease demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. The floorcovering industry is highly competitive.  We face competition from a number of domestic manufacturers and independent distributors of floorcovering products and, in certain product areas, foreign manufacturers.  There has been significant consolidation within the floorcovering industry that has caused a number of our existing and potential competitors to be significantly larger and have significantly greater resources and access to capital than we do. Maintaining our competitive position may require us to make substantial additional investments in our product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network and sales and marketing activities, which may be limited by our access to capital, as well as restrictions set forth in our credit facilities.  Competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for our products and in the loss of market share.  In addition, we face, and will continue to face, pressure on sales prices of our products from competitors.  As a result of any of these factors, there could be a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. Raw material prices may increase. The cost of raw materials has a significant impact on our profitability.  In particular, our business requires the purchase of large volumes of nylon and polyester yarn, as well as wool yarns, synthetic backing, latex, and dyes.  Increases in the cost of these raw materials could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to pass these increases through to our customers.  We believe we are successful in passing along raw material and other cost increases as they may occur; however, there can be no assurance that we will successfully recover such increases in cost. Unanticipated termination or interruption of our arrangements with third-party suppliers of nylon yarn could have a material adverse effect on us. Nylon yarn is the principal raw material used in our floorcovering products.  A significant portion of such yarn is purchased from one supplier.  We believe there are other sources of nylon yarns; however, an unanticipated termination or interruption of our supply arrangements could adversely affect our ability to supply our customers and could be material. Environmental, safety and health regulatory governance. Various federal, state and local environmental laws govern the use of our current and former facilities. These laws govern such matters as: •Discharges to air and water;•Handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and waste; and•Remediation of contamination from releases of hazardous substances in our facilities and off-site disposal locations. Our operations also are governed by laws relating to workplace safety and worker health, which, among other things, establish noise standards and regulate the use of hazardous materials and chemicals in the workplace.  We have taken, and will continue to take, steps to comply with these laws.  If we fail to comply with present or future environmental or safety regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities.  However, we cannot ensure that complying with these environmental or health and safety laws and requirements will not adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Future laws, ordinances or regulations could give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Table of Contents    7Acts of Terrorism. Our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of international conflicts or acts of terrorism.  Terrorist acts or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to our facilities, employees, customers, suppliers, and distributors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  Such conflicts also may cause damage or disruption to transportation and communication systems and to our ability to manage logistics in such an environment, including receipt of supplies and distribution of products. Unanticipated Business Interruptions. Our business could be adversely affected if a significant portion of our plant, equipment or operations were damaged or interrupted by a casualty, condemnation, utility service, work stoppage or other event beyond our control.  Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition"
